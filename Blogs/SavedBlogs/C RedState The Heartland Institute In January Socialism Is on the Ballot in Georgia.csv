C, In January Socialism Is on the Ballot in Georgia, The Heartland Institute, 2020-11-13, For the first time in U.S. history control of the U.S. Senate will be decided in two run-off races on January 5—just 15 days before the next president is sworn is—in Georgia. With so much political power at stake both parties are gearing up for a seven-week campaign that could literally change America—forever. As Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently said “Now we take Georgia then we change America!” Schumer’s quip came shortly after the mainstream liberal media coronated Joe Biden as the president-elect which is not assured until mid-December when most states will officially certify their election results. However given the likelihood that Biden will occupy the Oval Office next year coupled with the Democrats’ retention of their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives all eyes in the political world are focused on the Peach State at least for the next several weeks. The Democratic Party’s candidates Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff both fall on the far-left end of the political spectrum. In general both support a more robust federal government. Both are in-favor of a public option which moves the needle closer to universal health care. Warnock and Ossoff also support taxing the rich more environmental regulations including rejoining the Paris Accords and many other policies that would inhibit personal freedom and deter individual responsibility while growing government’s footprint and people’s dependence upon Uncle Sam. On the other hand both of the Republican Party’s candidates Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) oppose bigger government higher taxes and more regulations. In other words the contrast could not be clearer among the candidates. The GOP’s candidates would serve as a bulwark against a possible socialist agenda at the federal level whereas the Democratic Party’s candidates should they both win would put America in a perilous position. At sake is socialism in America plain and simple. In case you think this is far-fetched perhaps you should consider what would likely occur if the Democrats win both races and control of the U.S. Senate. Not that long ago the Democratic Party’s leadership including Schumer explicitly stated what they would pursue should they control both houses of Congress and the White House in 2021. First they would change America’s governing system. Their to-do list would include eliminating the Senate filibuster packing the Supreme Court with liberal justices adding two heavily Democratic states (Washington DC and Puerto Rico) undoing the Electoral College and implementing nationwide mail-in voting. By changing the system Democrats would then have a heyday implementing their far-left socialist agenda. Everything from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal would be on the table and very possible. Without a Senate filibuster a simple majority which they would possess with the vice-president’s tie-breaking vote is all they would need to put their radical agenda into reality. Should this scenario come to pass America would indeed change as Schumer shouted in the streets of New York City last week. But this would be far from the incremental change that has embodied American politics since the inception of this nation more than two centuries ago. If the Democrats are victorious in both Senate races it would be wholesale change the likes of which has never happened in our country. It would be ironic if the milquetoast Joe Biden who championed himself as a moderate during his 47-year career in politics became the agent of change or better put fundamental transformation that his boss President Obama was unable to achieve during his two terms. However that should not be all that surprising. Obama governed during a time when the Democratic Party still mostly opposed socialism. In 2020 the Democratic Party is a completely different animal. Socialism has become the banner that is championed by the party’s most prominent and powerful members. Will America be changed in the words of Schumer for the worse or will the United States stave off the onslaught of socialism that lurks just around the corner?
