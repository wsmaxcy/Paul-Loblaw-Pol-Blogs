L, Philosophical question of the day, YoungDumbSon, 2021-05-08, My Trump loving neighbor just brought a letter feom the IRS to my house that was wrongfully delivered to his.Â  It outlined the $1400 stimulus payment and other benefits of the 1.9 trillion dollar bill recently passed by Congress. The question is: How many Teump supporters returned their stimulus payment because it was SOCIALIST?
