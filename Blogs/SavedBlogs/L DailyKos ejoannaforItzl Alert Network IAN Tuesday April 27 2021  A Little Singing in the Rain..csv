L, IAN: Tuesday April 27 2021:  A Little "Singing in the Rain.", ejoannaforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-26, Tuesday:  A day to: take what we can get rain wise.      Monday: Crimson Quillfeather Tuesday: ejoanna Wednesday: Pam from Calif Thursday: art ah zen Friday: FloridaSNMOM Saturday: FloridaSNDad Sunday: loggersbrat Yippee!!!  We here in the San Francisco Bay Area actually got some. . . . . RAIN yesterday!  It was weird: the sounds smells and coolness of this strange phenomenon! I was outside at the time without an umbrella of course (Hey!  What’s an “umbrella”?)  And I did not mind getting all wet at all. And as it happened TCM had scheduled the iconic musical “Singing in the Rain” as we were actually getting rainfall!! It was all coincidental; TCM is showing Oscars movies all month alphabetically so it was just time for the S’s. But what a treat as the rain continued during our afternoon!  I have grown to love that movie for a lot of reasons besides the iconic rain dance sequence.   It is also a very funny sendup of Hollywood. Today we are back to sunshine and a few non-rain clouds. I hope and pray that it’s not another 6 months before we get rain here.  We’ll be in real trouble. Meanwhile what’s your iconic musical??
