L, NH-Sen: Sen. John Hickenlooper (D. CO) Helps Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) Preserve Dem Senate Majority, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-27, Received this e-mail today from U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper (D. CO) in support of U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan’s (D. NH) re-election campaign:  Folks Our Democratic Senate majority rests on New Hampshire. My good friend Maggie Hassan won her seat in 2016 by a mere 1017 votes — it was the closest Senate race of all time. That’s why Mitch McConnell has made her a top target. He thinks she’s vulnerable. If we want to prevent McConnell from taking the reins we need to make sure Maggie wins in New Hampshire. Maggie’s team needs our urgent help to meet their end-of-month goal so they’ll have the resources to fight off the GOP’s attacks. Can you split a contribution now?  Maggie got her start in public service as an advocate fighting to ensure that children like her son Ben who experiences severe disabilities would be fully included in their communities and have the same opportunities as everyone else. We just cannot afford to lose Maggie’s voice in the Senate. But Mitch McConnell and his donors are hell-bent on retaking the majority so they will stop at nothing to defeat her. Please split a contribution between Maggie’s campaign and our work to protect our Senate majority now. We’ve come too far and have fought too hard to let our guard down now.  Thanks for your support John Click here to donate to Hassan’s re-election campaign.
