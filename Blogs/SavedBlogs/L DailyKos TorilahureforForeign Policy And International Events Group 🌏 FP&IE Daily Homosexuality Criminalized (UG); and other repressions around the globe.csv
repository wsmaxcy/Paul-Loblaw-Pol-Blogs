Unfortunately most of the yesterday I ended up scrambling to respond to colleagues and associates (who probably caught up in reading like me on Saturday) asking about the devlopement in Uganda. Uganda: Latest legislation dubbed ‚ÄúSexual Offences Bill‚Äù while sounding as if it was meant to imprive things is a piece of legislative agenda that has many many repressions and assault on human dignity built into it. The Daily Monitor. has numerous pieces each dealing with separate elements of the new horror that is being imposed upon the people of Uganda. The Daily Monitor staff Patience Ahimbisibwe and¬† Esther Oluka report Uganda criminalises homosexuality again   Uganda has for the second time within seven years criminalised gay sex and this time imposed a 10-year jail term for convicts.The new offence and penalties were contained in the report of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee presented to the House and Members of Parliament scrutinising provisions of the Sexual Offences Bill 2019 passed them on May 3. The original version of the Bill sponsored by the Uganda Women Parliamentary Association (UWOPA) only imported the Penal Code Act provision on ‚Äúunnatural offences‚Äù and did not expressly criminalise or ban gay or lesbian sex.However the enacted Bill in Clause 11 criminalises and bans ‚Äúpenetration of another person‚Äôs anus with other person‚Äôs sexual organ or with any object and (ii) sexual acts between persons of the same gender‚Äù. Uganda first criminalised homosexuality and imposed life imprisonment penalty for convicts in 2014 and President Museveni while signing the anti-gay Act of Parliament into law said Ugandan scientists had convinced him that homosexuality was an act of nurture not nature. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ [so] society can do something to discourage the trend‚Äù he said during the then televised signing ceremony.The law however kicked up diplomatic storm straining Uganda‚Äôs relations with donors and opened up the country to both scrutiny and condemnation by rights groups across the world.   Other articles you do not want to miss are Esther Oluka talks with Amoding (MP who was pushing for the bill) about what was gained and what was lost Amoding Sexual Offences Bill mover speaks on gains misses Are you satisfied with the enacted version of the Sexual Offences Bill 2019 that you moved? ¬†We are not entirely satisfied because we lost some of the Clauses (1 and 36) we wanted. But we have taken what has been given and for those that we didn‚Äôt get advocacy continues. Maybe in the future we shall get what we want. What are those Clauses that were lost that you wanted in the Bill?Largely consent (Clause 36). If you look at the Bill consent is central in all sexual matters and that is why we wanted it to be clearly provided for; and that consent can be withdrawn at any time. It is expected that in a sexual relationship the persons involved are human beings who can understand and there are circumstances that warrant that. If your partner says please stop there is [problem] for this thing (sex) to be abandoned that is not a big issue.If you care about your partner and you also care about your own health there could be reasons why consent can be withdrawn including for medical reasons. That should be sufficient reason to withdraw and be granted by the partner. And it does not only apply to women. It applies across the board. An Op-Ed by Benjamin Rukwengye who was outraged that legislature did not even seem to comprehend what consent is and has additional thoughts about why consent has been ignored. he uses some examples of specific events to guide readers (he is really aiming this at the legislature) in this that is equally applicable globally The sexual consent guide for dummies Brittany Higgins. She was 24 years old and had recently started at her dream job as a political adviser in Australia‚Äôs Parliament House.One evening she went out for drinks with colleagues and had one too many ‚Äì not to be unexpected for a 24-year-old. A senior staffer offered to drop her home but instead drove to Parliament into the Defense Minister‚Äôs office and raped her. When she reported to the senior minister she was hushed; and eventually decided against filing a formal complaint because she feared that it would lead to her losing her job. The assailant however was sacked thereafter ‚Äì not for the rape allegations though ‚Äì for having breached Parliamentary security on the night. Chanel Contos. When she was just 13 she was sexually assaulted by someone who a year later assaulted her friend. None of them knew squat about sexual assault. Later in high school Contos and three friends went to a party where at some point in the night they realized that one of them was missing. Thailand: From The Diplomat it seems¬† the current Thai government that came to power through¬† overthrowing democratically elected givernments (twice) is preparing yet more assault on civil society. Thai Government Readies Legal Shackles for Civil Society Thailand‚Äôs government is readying a new piece of legislation targeting the activities of non-profit groups which activists and human rights groups have decried as a purposeful attempt to quash an ongoing campaign of protest and dissent. Back in February Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha‚Äôs cabinet approved a draft law that would bring to heel the country‚Äôs non-government organizations by requiring them to register under a new set of guidelines established by the Minister of the Interior. At the time government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek justified the move on the grounds that only 87 of Thailand‚Äôs many civil society groups and non-government organizations are registered officially with the government. She said that others claim to be non-profit organizations but do not operate for the ‚Äúpublic interest.‚Äù Brazil: After a deadly ‚Äúofficial police action‚Äù in Rio de Janero covered by Folha International (7th May 2021 summary in English) Police Carry Out The Most Lethal Operation in The History of RJ with at Least 25 Dead  A police operation in a Rio de Janeiro favela left 25 people dead and is already considered the most lethal in history according to researchers associations and professionals who operate in the area. According to the UFF (Universidade Federal Fluminense) Study Group on New Illegalism which has produced and maintained a database since 1989 there has never been a single operation with this number of deaths. The highest total recently occurred in Complexo do Alem√£o in 2007 with 19 fatalities.  Editorial in Folha de S.

Israel - Palestine: You have probably seen a few of these already about how on the holy night Israeli authorities launch forceful action to clear peaceful protesters who sat in protest at the mosque. The ongoing protests and actions by Israel Givernment covered here¬† Hhre at Al Jazeera a one of the better coverage of the event Scores of Palestinians in East Jerusalem wounded on holy night Another night of violence left at least 90 Palestinians wounded after Israeli police cracked down on protesters outside occupied East Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City as concerns mounted on Sunday that the situation may spiral out of control. An estimated 90000 Muslim worshippers prayed at the nearby Al-Aqsa Mosque on Islam‚Äôs holy night of Laylat al-Qadr ‚Äì or the ‚ÄúNight of Destiny‚Äù the most sacred of prayers during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan ‚Äì on Saturday. Some stayed on to protest Israeli plans to forcibly expel Palestinian families from their homes on land claimed by illegal Jewish settlers in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. Israeli officers on horseback and in riot gear fired stun grenades and water cannon against Palestinians who in turn threw stones lit fires and tore down police barricades in the streets leading to the walled Old City‚Äôs gates. With all that in mind please post a link in comments to some other uplifting story so that I can at least have a coffee with slight calm. Perhaps a couple of photos or articles of birds cats llamas?
