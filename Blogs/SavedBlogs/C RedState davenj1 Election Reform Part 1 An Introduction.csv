C, Election Reform Part 1: An Introduction, davenj1, 2021-01-07, In the ensuing days this writer will be publishing a series of articles regarding necessary or proposed reforms in the electoral process.  The Presidential election of 2020 brought to the fore the need for corrections in the system processes associated with it and the details involved. It has been noted by many election experts that although the results were not impossible the statistical norms being violated creating the perfect storm of a Biden victory was implausible.  Perhaps those statistical norms need to be updated or perhaps- more likely- something else was going on here.  The Left media and Democrats (all one and the same) claim that for the election to be stolen by Biden there must have been systemic massive fraud that extended across state lines.  They would have you believe that some nefarious conspiracy was hatched in the cellar of the DNC headquarters.  Lacking smoking gun evidence of that nature any criticism of what happened is “conspiracy theory.” But as experts have shown this need not necessarily be the case.  Instead although Biden received an alleged ton of votes in 2020 it is not the raw numbers or even the numbers posted in particular key states.  It is not how he performed relative to Clinton in 2016 or Obama in 2012/2008.  It is where he performed just well enough to make a difference.  Did they find and exploit a weakness in the Electoral College- the very thing they rail against? There is no doubt in my mind that the Democrats saw studied and exploited flaws- probably independent of any other actor- in the key swing states.  It started with the advent of widespread acceptance of mail-in ballots in response to unfounded fears about the Wuhan flu.  That steady stream of concern in the summer about the Postal Service and mailboxes on the part of the media laid the seeds that allowed states unfamiliar with the practice of mail-in voting on a massive basis to alter and adjust their own election laws.  What was accuracy in votes compared to the safety of mail-in voting?  By the same token all of the blame does not lie with Democrats.  Since the summer of 2020 Trump and his team were talking about the potential for fraud.  Perhaps they misjudged the level of deceit on the part of Democrats.  But it seemed as if they had no game plan if the impossible happened and Biden prevailed.  The compilation of evidence of fraud should have started long before a vote was cast.  Rep. Kelly’s lawsuit in Pennsylvania is instructive. The Pennsylvania state constitution allows for mail-in voting in four- and only four- instances.  But A-77 changed that in contravention of that constitutional provision.  If there was this unconstitutional changing of election law in Pennsylvania perhaps the lawsuit should have resulted in a challenge a little sooner.  Instead when the challenge did occur the state supreme court relied on the doctrine of “laches.”  Whether their decision was correct or not surely GOP lawyers and lawmakers should have seen the potential problems.  A good legal team would have planned for all contingencies. Then again maybe the GOP just relied too heavily on the good intentions of officials.  That would be misguided when you are talking about power-hungry Democrats.  Perhaps they misjudged the depths to which Democrats would sink in order to get “their guy” elected. Regardless of these dynamics and shortcomings and despite what Trump says and how the media portrays those utterances as destroying faith in the democratic process it was their actions that seriously damaged that faith. It is my belief that the whole system teeters on the brink of collapse.  When people start talking about instituting martial law to overcome the “results” of an election and some of that talk seeps through to the mainstream media you know people smell a rat.  Polls taken indicate that even a portion of Democrat voters believe something is amiss here. In the election of 2020 that perception will endure as long as needed reforms are not instituted.  There may not be a single smoking gun that proves definitively that fraud occurred but there may not be that need for it if faith is shattered in the system.  Instead it is a series of small-caliber smoking guns in a few select areas or states.  Weaknesses were noticed and exploited.  Those weaknesses are what most likely created the implausibility of a Biden win. Finally let us not forget the in some cases complicity of Republicans.  It was after all a Republican-led legislature in Pennsylvania that crafted A-77.  It was a Republican-led legislature in Georgia that contracted with Dominion.  It was a Republican governor in Georgia who mishandled a recount when there should have been an audit.  It was a Republican-led legislature in Arizona that turned a blind eye and deaf ear to complaints.  All the post-election hearings and presentations of evidence are simply heated rhetoric and moot without reformative action. I will end this introduction to the upcoming series of articles dedicated to what I feel are needed reforms with a comparison of a quote from a Supreme Court Justice from a case in a different context.  Said that Justice (and I apologize for not citing the case) to paraphrase: “I can’t define pornography but I know it when I see it.”
