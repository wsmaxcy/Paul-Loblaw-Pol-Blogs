L, Maddow Spots The Stat That Proves Cheney Purge Is Just Another Supplication To Trump, Lee Moran, 2021-05-12, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday pointed out why Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) imminent purge from a House GOP leadership role is “absolutely” not because she’s an “insufficiently Trumpy Republican.” Maddow noted that Cheney who faces removal Wednesday for rejecting ex-President Donald Trump’s election lies actually voted with Trump about 92.9% of the time according to FiveThirtyEight.com. Cheney’s likely replacement Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) only voted with Trump 77.7% of the time. “Significantly less in terms of policy in terms of allying herself with Trump in terms of how Trump governed” said Maddow. “Cheney is much Trumpier than Elise Stefanik.” “But that’s just proof that this isn’t at all about policy” she added. “It is about something else. It is about personality and it is about supplication. It’s about performative sycophancy bending the knee abjectly to Donald Trump.” Watch the video here:
