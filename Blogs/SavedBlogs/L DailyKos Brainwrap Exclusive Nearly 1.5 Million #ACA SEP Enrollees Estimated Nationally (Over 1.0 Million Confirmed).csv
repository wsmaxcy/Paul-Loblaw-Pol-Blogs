L, Exclusive: Nearly 1.5 Million #ACA SEP Enrollees Estimated Nationally (Over 1.0 Million Confirmed), Brainwrap, 2021-05-10, Last week the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) posted an updated report on the number of Americans who have selected Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) through HealthCare.Gov which hosts ACA enrollment for 36 states during the ongoing COVID Special Enrollment Period (SEP) which began on February 15th and is set to continue through August 15th in most states. In addition to the 940000 QHPs via the federal exchange (HC.gov) from 2/15 through 4/30 I've compiled official SEP enrollment numbers for several of the states which operate their own ACA exchanges as well: The total of these plus the 940000 via HC.gov comes to 1003516 confirmed so far. Of course this only includes part of the 75 day period from 2/15 - 4/30 (a few states run longer most are far shorter) and other states are still missing entirely including New York New Jersey and The Big One: California. However extrapolating from the daily average of the data I do have strongly suggests that around 19400 additional people have selected QHPs per day nationally for total SEP enrollment since 2/15 of close to 1.5 million so far. (It's also worth noting that HC.gov states only accounted for around 68.7% of all 2021 Open Enrollment Period enrollees so even a simple extrapolation based on that alone would give you 1.37 million nationally.) It's important to keep in mind as always that something like 5800 people typically enroll via Special Enrollment Periods nationally under normal circumstances anyway such as losing employer coverage getting married/divorced giving birth adopting a child moving to a different state and so on so of those ~1.5M SEPs perhaps 435000 of them would have enrolled prior to the COVID pandemic during the same time period. That still means that over 1 million people have likely enrolled so far this spring who otherwise wouldn't have done so. Assuming my 19.4K/day average is accurate and assuming it continues at that pace that would mean an additional 600K SEP enrollees by the end of May or around 2.1 million total. However I strongly suspect that the pace has already dropped off in most states; Idaho ended their COVID SEP on 4/30 and Vermont ends theirs on 5/15 for instance (exceptions will likely include California Connecticut and Washington which only started offering their expanded AmRescuePlan subsidies more recently). I'd then expect another enrollment spike starting in mid-July which is when the AmRescuePlan's Unemployment Benefits subsidy modifier goes into effect in most states...except that we'll already be over halfway through the year by that point which will likely limit the impact of this to some degree. Remember: The COVID SEP is ongoing through August 15th in most states.
