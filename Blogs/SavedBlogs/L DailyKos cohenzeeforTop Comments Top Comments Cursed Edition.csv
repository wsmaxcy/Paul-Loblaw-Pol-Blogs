L, Top Comments: Cursed Edition, cohenzeeforTop Comments, 2021-06-29, I have written previously about how my birthday is typically one of the worst days of any year for me. Even with being cursed I usually plan something for the day and typically it goes badly. Last year’s was obviously bad. I wrote about the postponed birthday trip that is now scheduled for this August. Even if you discount that it was still a bad day. I planned to FaceTime with the friend I was supposed to visit in London. Unfortunately something came up and instead of talking while I was at home we spoke while I was in a hot car sitting in a parking lot making my family wait for me to eat dinner. Since the positivity rate here last summer was under 1% we went to a restaurant on the water near my home. The setting was nice; however the food was only ok. On top of that the Islanders played their one and only game on my birthday. It shouldn’t surprise anyone they lost the game. They did win the series so there was salvage value there. We are now less than two months from the date I am supposed to fly out to London. After 4 months of positive news on opening up in England the Delta variant of the coronavirus has brought the progress to stop. Should I be surprised? I don’t think so. There is still time for things to turn around though I am skeptical. IMO with all the scientific evidence of how effective the mRNA vaccines are against all the current variants countries with decent vaccination rates should be allowing vaccinated individuals to travel freely between their countries. If I cannot complete my trip in August I don’t even know what new dates I should choose. Without guidance it becomes hard to decide. Do I go book for early fall to try and get it in before some other major event happens? Do I go with my half birthday in Feb hoping that date isn’t cursed. Do I wait another year and go next August hoping nothing else ridiculous happens between now and then. Do I change my flight so I can quarantine before which I am pretty sure I cannot afford? (Don’t even get me started on the ridiculous testing requirements the UK is imposing on Amber countries.)  Diarist reserves all rights to his original writing only.
