L, Treating the Cause Not the Effect, Loen Thol, 2021-07-03, Treating the Cause Not the Effect  Many health conditions are caused by what we eat. This article is intended to be a suggestion and not addressing all medical conditions. I will use my self as an example to explain. Let’s say you are a 55 to 65 year old male. Your blood test come back that your cholesterol is elevated your A1C is elevated you have periodic heart racing with a heart rate to 160+ beats for an hour. You have high blood pressure. Your doctor begins to prescribe you medications to reduce these numbers into the normal range. What just happened??? The doctor is treating the effect and not the cause. All of my doctors use the same mode of operation. Prescribe a pill instead of asking the patient to keep a record of all the food and drinks they ingest. Such as :  This is from my personal journal I keep daily  July 1 2021 8:15 am - synthroid low dose aspirin tall glass electrolyte water 9:10 am - 99mg/dl 9:20 am - 1 1/2 cup Blk coffee 9:30 am - 1 Glipizide 10:15 am -Shredded wheat - 2 biscuits - cal = 170 - carbs = 41g - potassium = 230mg - Un- sweet Almond milk - 1 cup - cal = 40 - carbs = 1 g - sodium = 45mg - 1 apple - cal = 95 - carbs = 25 - sodium = 2mg 10:45 am - 1/2 metformin- Tylenol - 2 @ 650mg tablets. 12:15 pm -Tuna Fish sandwich -2 slices of whole grain bread - cal = 200 - carbs = 20 - sodium = 20mg - 1 tbsp mayo - cal = 45 - carbs 3g - sodium = 105mg - cholesterol = 4mg - tuna - cal = 80 - carbs = 1g - sodium = 270mg - cholesterol = 40mg - 2 dill pickles - cal = 8 - sodium 20mg 3:45 pm -2400 mg turmeric curcumin 3:45 pm - 105mg/dl  6:00pm - 60mg/dl NO GLIPIZIDE 6:30 pm -4 egg whites - cal = 44 - sodium = 124mg - 1/2 cup grits - cal = 94 - carbs = 12g - sodium = 158mg - 2tsp butter - cal = 52 - sodium = 2mg - cholesterol = 20mg-1 slice of sprout bread - cal =100 - carbs = 10 - sodium = 10mg 1 tbsp orange marmalade - cal = 50 - carbs = 13g - sodium = 11mg -8oz green wise ground turkey - cal = 320 - sodium = 170mg - cholesterol = 160mg 6:50 pm- 1/2 metformin 7:00 pm - Blood Pressure - 149/100 8:00 pm - 4/3 cup Breyers non-dairy chocolate ice cream - cal = 340 - cholesterol = 0 - sodium = 20mg - carbs = 50g - potassium = 340mg 9:00 pm - Home made chili - 2 oz ground beef - 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes - 1/2 cup beans - cal = 141 - sodium = 147mg - carbs = 82g - cholesterol = 20mg - potassium = 190mg Total water = 5 tall glasses Total today - cal = 1779 - carbs = 258g - sodium = 1104mg - potassium = 760mg - cholesterol = 244mg  Average glucose = 88mg/dl  I am a type2 diabetic. Since January I have reduced my diabetes medications by 3/4. I brought my A1c from 10.3 to 6.3. I have lost 33lbs. Every time I went to my doctor instead of asking me to keep a journal of everything I ate they just prescribed me pills. When I brought up the issue of tracking nutrition instead of just prescribing medications they all responded “I am not a nutritionist.” I then inform them that it would be advantageous if they learned something about nutrition to be a better practitioner. So I set out to do the work myself. I found information concerning limits on carbs sodium cholesterol and potassium. I try to stay within the following ranges:  Maximum Per Day  Calories = 1500 - 2000 Carbohydrates = 200g Sodium = 1500mg Cholesterol = 300mg Potassium = 4700mg  Notice that there is no alcohol sugar drinks energy drinks whole milk ice cream with dairy. Water and some black coffee. No fast food or ready made food. Restaurant and fast food are packed with high levels of sodium additives and carbs. Those type of foods you have no idea what is in them. I am not suggesting to not eat those type of foods on occasion however regularly consumed they will not benefit you. I eat more turkey meat than beef because of the cholesterol and it is easy for me to digest. I do eat red meat on occasion but usually organic and lean. Caned food should be extremely reduced due to the sodium. I eat fresh vegetables or frozen. I look for low sodium or no sodium in can food such as tuna fish and chicken. I eat multigrain bread and not white.Whole wheat pasta not white. Cereal is non-sugar shredded wheat. I try to eat two fruits a day but not always. I check my glucose levels three to four times a day.  Diabetes and heart decease does not happen overnight. As we get older our bodies change due to aging. Our metabolism changes. If you begin to make changes now by the time you reach 55 to 65 you will not have as many health related problems.  I am not a doctor. This plan has helped me to regain a healthier life. It works for me. I want to encourage anyone who is struggling with weight gain diabetes water retention heart racing to consider journaling what you eat and drink daily to see if you can make healthier choices. Change your relationship to food and it is ok to go off track for a day and treat yourself once a week. It is what you do everyday that helps or hurts you. I stay on track all week and then on one weekend day I treat myself/reward my self. If you fall off your program don’t beat yourself up. Just get right back on track and go on.
