L, Photo Diary: A Walk in the Kopsick Palm Arboretum, Lenny FlankforShutterbugs, 2021-05-01, I haven’t been here for quite a while … The Kopsick Palm Arboretum is a small park in St Pete FL that displays palms and cycads from around the world.  Some of the identifying signs sadly are missing. But here are some photos from a walk. For those who don't know I lived in a converted campervan and traveled around the country posting photo diaries of places that I visited. But the pandemic has clipped my wings and I am now holed up in Florida until I can begin traveling again. :)
