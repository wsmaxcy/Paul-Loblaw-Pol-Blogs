C, Election 2020 Is Ultimately A False Documents Case, Martin Knight, 2020-12-20, If Team Trump were truly serious about fixing what happened in this election undoing the blatant theft we saw happen in real time this would have been treated as a law enforcement matter. Ultimately this is nothing more than a false documents case. And what do you do when investigating false documents? You look out for signs of forgery. Even when it involves millions of pieces of paper. If this had been treated properly the timeline for what should have happened this month would have looked liked this; Push the dates forward a week to cover the Electoral College meeting and voting or even two weeks and change a few details here and there. I am not a lawyer so I may have gotten some things about the Federal Marshal deputization process wrong. Ultimately though something like this tells you Team Trump is serious. But so far Team Trump’s strategy since November 3rd has been; LAWSUITS! LAWSUITS!! MORE LAWRSOOOOTS!!! But we’ve lost 67 lawsuits in a row … SILENCE!! MORE LAWRSOOOOTS!! Wh … what if we try looking for direct forensic evidence … like those ASOG guys did in Antrim County …? NOOOOO!! WE HAVE “ENOUGH” EVIDENCE!!! FORENSIC EVIDENCE IS FOR CUCKS!!! MORE! MORE!! MORE STUPID USELESS LAWRSOOOOTS!!! And so Rudy Giuliani Jenna Ellis and the rest of Trump’s legal team continue to file lawsuits demanding remedies they very well know are doomed to fail from the get-go. Even worse from all indications they have deliberately refused to make any attempt to develop the only type of evidence that could work. And because this is failure theater mark my words they will only start talking about forensic evidence after January 6th.
