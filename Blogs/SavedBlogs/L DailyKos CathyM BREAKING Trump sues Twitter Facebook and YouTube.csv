L, BREAKING: Trump sues Twitter Facebook and YouTube, CathyM, 2021-07-07, I’m sure DK staff will cover this very thoroughly but I wanted to post the newest news — Rump has put himself at the head of a “class action suit” targeting the social networks that kicked him off for violent seditious comments. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57754435 Trump sues Twitter Google and Facebook alleging 'censorship' Former US president Donald Trump has announced plans to sue tech giants Google Twitter and Facebook claiming that he is the victim of censorship. The class action lawsuit also targets the three companies' CEOs. Where is he getting all this lawyer money? Or is he not paying his lawyers?? Oh wait — he’s already grifting from it: I’m just gonna update as I find more stories:  @bradheath 47m Trump's Facebook lawsuit is filed in federal court in Florida. Facebook's terms of service requires that "any claim cause of action or dispute you have against us" be filed in federal court in northern California or San Mateo County state court. And here are the pdfs of the lawsuits against Twitter and YouTube: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.595801/gov.uscourts.flsd.595801.1.0.pdf storage.courtlistener.com/…  From what I can see Rump’s AOL Lawyers (Twitter’s calling them that because so many of them have listed AOL email accounts on the lawsuit!!) claim that because Twitter et al acted after the spreading concern about violence-encouraging tweets causing harm including by some governmental agencies these social media private companies have become “state actors” and thus can’t act like private companies and ban whoever they want. But I wonder if the  main point (besides the grifting) is because lil’ Donnie wants his ball back:  I’m not on Facebook but Twitter is already salivating about the discovery portion of these suits. But since Rump filed from Florida rather than the places of business of the defendents legal Twitter is suggesting they will be tossed out just for that: This is one of the lawyers I follow on Twitter because his take down of the Kraken lawsuits was masterful. He’s commenting on the lawyers who filed this suit for Rump today: have profiles highlighting their personal injury and wrongful death work.The idea that *these* are the lawyers representing a former President of the United States in a (bullshit) First Amendment litigation is just laughable And of course there’s the secondary gains from this new suit: 6m  This is the slate of lawyers on Rump’s side: I keep forgetting that some weird flaw in my desktop means you probably can’t click on these as live links! :-( This is a good thread and I’ll try to link to it Well this is nice to hear: And in case anyone has any doubts about how MAGAts will see this:  13s Trump and other victims of corporate censorship.It's a class action lawsuit we the people vs #BigTech moguls one lawsuit to prevent the coming kinetic civil war. It’s always Civil War with these guys... Here’s someone else I wish Twitter would ban:  I think xkcd sums it up brilliantly so check out this comic: xkcd.com/…  Yeah so I think we can confirm the grift aspect:  Just for fun: And it looks like the lawyers are in the spotlight: www.rawstory.com/…   Kraken level filing: The Trump lawsuit challenging Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act refers to the “Community Decency Act” which does not exist pic.twitter.com/cHZU9FBXe0 — Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) July 7 2021  Meanwhile — Rudy can’t help Donnie much even if he wanted to:
