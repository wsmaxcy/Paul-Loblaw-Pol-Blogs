L, Joe Manchin And His Bipartisan Fairy Go Down In Flames On CNN, John Amato, 2021-05-06, Sen. Joe Manchin still believes in the bipartisan fairy. He admitted on CNN that all the good work Joe Biden has done in his first 100 days was without Republican support. Still Manchin has refused to entertain the idea of ending the filibuster to get much-needed relief to the American people even as Mitch McConnell blew up the idea of bipartisanship completely this week. Chris Cuomo called Manchin out for clinging to the idea of bipartisanship when Republicans have no interest in acting like a political party. GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell just said "100% of my focus is on standing up to this administration. What we have in the United States Senate is total unity from Susan Collins to Ted Cruz in opposition to what the new Biden administration is trying to do to this country." After debating the merits of bipartisanship with CNN Chris Cuomo the host said there's a chance you get none of Biden's future agenda passed including any form of gun control. Manchin tried to fight back "Let's see what we've done already. Look what we've done. 1.9 trillion dollars...(ARPA)  Look what we did last year in an all bipartisan way. Look what we've done this year." Then Manchin f**ked himself and admitted the truth finally. "We didn't do it in a bipartisan way but we did it because it needed to be done with the pandemic that we had " Manchin said. He continued "We did 1.9 trillion..." Cuomo cut him off "But you didn't do it bipartisan." That sent Manchin stuttering like a a Jackie Gleason skit.  " Well huh...Homina homa homa homa. Cuomo said "That went through the reconciliation process Senator as you know. You went to reconciliation because they don't want to work with you." Manchin refused to give in to the idea that Republicans won't work with the Democrats. Cuomo kept repeating [Republicans] don't want it to work. Alluding to McConnell's words Cuomo said "He just said it to you. McConnell just said it." "That was one person" Mansion replied. "He's the head!" "That's one person." "He's the leader!" "He's not controlling all of that I assure you" Manchin responded.  Has Manchin been asleep since 2012? Mitch McConnell has been the most destructive legislative force in politics since Obama won the presidency.  He has abused the filibuster and blocked every Democratic option for spite and power.
