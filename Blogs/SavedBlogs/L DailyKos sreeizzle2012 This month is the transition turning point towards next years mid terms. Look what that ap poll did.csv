L, This month is the transition turning point towards next year's mid terms. Look what that ap poll did, sreeizzle2012, 2021-05-10, projects.fivethirtyeight.com/… Biden is under the 40 line for disapproval and above 53 line for approval.  As long as this continues slowly but gradually Biden should be above 55 line for approval and as close to 37 as possible for disapproval.  We still have a long way but Biden has got the hang of this!  On to those talking filibuster painful public accountability for the republicans. We will make them unpopular while using reconciliation to go big on everything.  I am optimistic public pressure will force some filibuster reform compromise if the talking painful filibusters are not painful enough.
