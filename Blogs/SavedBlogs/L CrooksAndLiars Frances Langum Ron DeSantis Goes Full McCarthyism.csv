L, Ron DeSantis Goes Full McCarthyism, Frances Langum, 2021-06-23, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Ron DeSantis is a stupid wanking fascist but you knew that.  Did you know he wants to "survey" members of the Florida public college community on their political beliefs in order to "encourage diversity"?   Yeah yeah that's totally unconstitutional and I suspect opinions about Ron DeSantis on college campuses in Florida are fairly lopsided in favor of "what a jackass."   And of course Ron's "reasoning" for this is based on vague ka-ka he pulled out of some orifice.  Tampa Bay Times: The governor did not name specific state universities or colleges with this problem. He was broad in his accusations about the higher education system and used vague anecdotes to justify the need for such a survey. For instance the governor said he “knows a lot of parents” who are worried that their children will be “indoctrinated” when they go off to college and that universities are promoting “orthodoxies.” But he did not offer specifics on those claims. As Driftglass said:  "This is the Republican Party that Liberals have been warning you about for 40 years." 30% of professors will be required to be part of the flat earth society so both sides can be heard. — VaPol (@VaTravel11) June 23 2021 Honestly I believe in the kids more than faculty and staff to come up with the best way to tank this. — Cheloca (@hoogemoogende) June 23 2021 When many are found as liberal this will be a way to cut funding to state schools. — Custer Lincoln (@ghostofcuster85) June 23 2021  pic.twitter.com/96NJEovkGm — Mister Wise (@IAmMisterWise) June 23 2021 .Buy a yearly subscription or make as generous a donation as you can afford.
