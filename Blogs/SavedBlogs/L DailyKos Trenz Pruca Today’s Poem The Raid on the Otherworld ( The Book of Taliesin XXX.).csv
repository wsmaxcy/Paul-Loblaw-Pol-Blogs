L, Today’s Poem: The Raid on the Otherworld ( The Book of Taliesin XXX.), Trenz Pruca, 2021-04-22, I love Taliesin’s poetry. Although he lived over 1500 years ago and wrote in old Brythonic once you get beyond the knights and medieval imagery there is a modern feel to it like the poetry behind Dylan’s music. I often think of it as ancient Celtic Rap*.     I WILL praise the sovereign supreme king of the land  Who hath extended his dominion over the shore of the world. Complete was the prison of Gweir in Caer Sidi Through the spite of Pwyll and Pryderi. No one before him went into it. The heavy blue chain held the faithful youth And before the spoils of Annwvn woefully he sings And till doom shall continue a bard of prayer.   Thrice enough to fill Prydwen we went into it; Except seven none returned from Caer Sidi   Am I not a candidate for fame if a song is heard?  In Caer Pedryvan four its revolutions;  In the first word from the cauldron when spoken From the breath of nine maidens it was gently warmed. Is it not the cauldron of the chief of Annwvn? What is its intention? A ridge about its edge and pearls. It will not boil the food of a coward that has not been sworn A sword bright gleaming to him was raised  And in the hand of Lleminawg it was left. And before the door of the gate of Uffern [hell] the lamp was burning   And when we went with Arthur; a splendid labour  Except seven none returned from Caer Vedwyd.   Am I not a candidate for fame with the listened song In Caer Pedryvan in the isle of the strong door? The twilight and pitchy darkness were mixed together. Bright wine their liquor before their retinue.   Thrice enough to fill Prydwen we went on the sea  Except seven none returned from Caer Rigor.   I shall not deserve much from the ruler of literature Beyond Caer Wydyr they saw not the prowess of Arthur. Three score Canhwr stood on the wall Difficult was a conversation with its sentinel.   Thrice enough to fill Prydwen there went with Arthur Except seven none returned from Caer Golud.   I shall not deserve much from those with long shields. They know not what day who the causer What hour in the serene day Cwy was born. Who caused that he should not go to the dales of Devwy. They know not the brindled ox thick his head-band. Seven score knobs in his collar.   And when we went with Arthur of anxious memory Except seven none returned from Caer Vandwy.   I shall not deserve much from those of loose bias They know not what day the chief was caused. What hour in the serene day the owner was born. What animal they keep silver its head.   When we went with Arthur of anxious contention Except seven none returned from Caer Ochren.   Monks congregate like dogs in a kennel From contact with their superiors they acquire knowledge Is one the course of the wind is one the water of the sea? Is one the spark of the fire of unrestrainable tumult?   Monks congregate like wolves From contact with their superiors they acquire knowledge. They know not when the deep night and dawn divide. Nor what is the course of the wind or who agitates it In what place it dies away on what land it roars. The grave of the saint is vanishing from the altar-tomb. I will pray to the Lord the great supreme That I be not wretched. Christ be my portion.
