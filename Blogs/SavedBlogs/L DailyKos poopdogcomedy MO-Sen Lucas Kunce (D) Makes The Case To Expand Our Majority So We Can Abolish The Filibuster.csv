L, MO-Sen: Lucas Kunce (D) Makes The Case To Expand Our Majority So We Can Abolish The Filibuster, poopdogcomedy, 2021-05-10, Received this e-mail today from Marine Veteran Lucas Kunche’s (D. MO) U.S. Senate campaign: We’ve got a quick choice for you. Pick one: A) Keep the filibuster. B) Protect voting rights make every vote count expose dark money donors pass the PRO Act achieve universal healthcare raise the minimum wage… There are so many other urgent priorities for working families we can’t list them all.   It’s a no-brainer. If we want to achieve our vision of an America where everyday people call the shots NOT massive corporations and career politicians keeping the filibuster isn’t an option. Yet Democrats are still at least one vote short of ending it. Lucas is crystal-clear on this: Help us flip Missouri's U.S. Senate seat in 2022 and he'll vote to end the filibuster.  If you’re with Lucas on this add your name to sign our petition to end the filibuster so our Senate majority can make real progress for everyday people.  SIGN NOW  Let’s abolish the anti-democratic filibuster once and for all. -Team Lucas Kunce Click here to add your name.
