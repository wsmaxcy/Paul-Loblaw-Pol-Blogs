L, Idaho Governor Rescinds Anti-Mask Mandate, Ed Scarce, 2021-05-29, So what do you when your Governor is out of town and you're the acting Governor as his Lt. Governor you two don't exactly see eye-to-eye on much of anything and you've already announced a primary challenge to him? Well if you're Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin and you're a full-blown nutjob anyway you pull a stunt like this. Source; CBS2 Boise BOISE Idaho (CBS2) — Governor Brad Little denounced Lt. Governor Janice McGeachin's executive order Friday saying it was an "irresponsible abuse of power." Little was out of the state on Thursday which provided McGeachin the ability to become acting governor. She used that power to sign an executive order prohibiting the state and its political subdivisions including public schools to enforce mask mandates. Little signed another executive order when he returned Friday restoring control for local entities to enforce mask mandates. "The action that took place was an irresponsible self-serving political stunt" Little said. "Taking the earliest opportunity to act solitarily on a highly politicized polarizing issue without conferring with local jurisdictions legislators and the sitting Governor is simply put an abuse of power."
