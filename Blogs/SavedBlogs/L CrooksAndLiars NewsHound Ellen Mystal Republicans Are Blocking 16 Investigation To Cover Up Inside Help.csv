L, Mystal: Republicans Are Blocking 1/6 Investigation To Cover Up Inside Help, NewsHound Ellen, 2021-06-20, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  On Saturday's The Cross Connection host Tiffany Cross played a clip of Mike Pence being booed by conservatives and newly-released video from January 6 of a former police officer beating a police officer at the Capitol with an American flag pole. Elie Mystal the Nation's justice correspondent explained how those two things go together: There is simply no way that these people were able to pull this off without some kind of inside help. I don't know who and I guess I'll never know but that's what the Republicans are trying to prevent. "The danger here is so great" Mystal said he can’t laugh at Pence being heckled. “I don’t want Mike Pence to die. I want him to be a joke” Mystal added. "I can't enjoy him being heckled because the people who tried to kill him are still out there and his own party won't investigate." Mystal may be more concerned about Pence than his own brother is. Rep. Greg Pence voted against the bipartisan January 6 commission. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
