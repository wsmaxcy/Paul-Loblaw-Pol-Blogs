L, Curious: Are you Really into autos sorta into not at all (Design repair races etc.), CameronProf, 2021-06-28, I am a total anomaly or so I think. Being from Detroit every single friend I have from male to female conservative to liberal etc. knows about cars.  If they see a car they can tell you if it is a Ford a Chevy a Toyota etc. They can many times tell you the model and many of them (though not the majority) can tell you the year etc.  I have friends really into auto engineering then I have friends really into auto repair and even some into auto racing.  I would be a horrible police witness I already know this. I do not know what makes a sedan a sedan or what truly separates an SUV from a van. You could show me 10 different cats in direct sunlight and I would never know the make of it much less the model.  I know some folks here are into auto racing and more power to them but I could not think of a worse way to spend a day.  I look at the numbers of fans that NASCAR has and like I said I know some on the left (Though I guess the numbers would bear out the idea that is enjoyed more by those on the right than on the left) enjoy it.  So taken everything together automobile repair dynamics design engineering racing etc. how much are you into automobiles overall? I want to see how much in the minority I really am.
