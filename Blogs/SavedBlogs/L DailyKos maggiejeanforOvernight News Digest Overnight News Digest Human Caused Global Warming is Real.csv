L, Overnight News Digest: Human Caused Global Warming is Real, maggiejeanforOvernight News Digest, 2021-06-28, Headlines from some of the stories covered tonight: Good news: A new study finds that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines may protect against the coronavirus for years. https://t.co/5CVyMBknBr DW News It's true that within its 4.5-billion-year history planet Earth has experienced periods of lesser and greater warmth. Altering over many thousands of years these shifting temperatures have been determined by variations in Earth's orbit around the sun. While greater distances have resulted in colder cycles shifts closer to the ball of heat have led to warmer interglacial periods. In the late 20th century when scientists started looking at how temperatures have changed over time they observed a much faster rate of planetary warming from the 1980s than had previously been recorded. n 1998 researchers from the US University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona published a study showing the average annual global temperature over the past 1000 years. To work out earlier temperatures going back half a millennium before the thermometer was invented they studied so-called proxy or natural records — measurements of ice cores tree rings and corals. The outcome illustrated little variation for many hundreds of years until the 20th century when there was suddenly a sharp rise. [...] He said the scientific community is as confident in human-caused climate change today as in the understanding of the theory of gravity. "There are uncertainties and nuances to discuss in climate science" said Cook. "But the one thing pretty much every scientist agrees upon today is that the warming we're seeing is driven by burning fossil fuels." The Guardian Leaked membership data from the neo-Confederate Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) organization has revealed that the organization’s members include serving military officers elected officials public employees and a national security expert whose CV boasts of “Department of Defense Secret Security Clearance”. But alongside these members are others who participated in and committed acts of violence at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville Virginia and others who hold overlapping membership in violent neo-Confederate groups such as the League of the South (LoS). The group organized as a federation of state chapters has recently made news for increasingly aggressive campaigns against the removal of Confederate monuments. This has included legal action against states and cities the flying of giant Confederate battle flags near public roadways and Confederate flag flyovers at Nascar races. The Guardian Seattle Portland and other cities in the Pacific north-west broke all-time heat records over the weekend with temperatures soaring well above 100F (37.8C). But forecasters said Monday could be even worse with the mercury possibly hitting 110F (43C) in Seattle and 115F (46C) in Portland. The high temperatures could continue on Tuesday in some areas. The extreme weather was caused by an extended “heat dome” parked over the Pacific north-west. The days-long heatwave was a taste of the future as climate change reshapes global weather patterns said Kristie Ebi a professor at the University of Washington who studies global warming and its effects on public health. C/NET Communities that couldn't get mortgage loans in the 1940s are the same areas without fast home internet service today. There's no easy fix. When Christina Wilson moved into Los Angeles public housing with her husband and teenage daughter four years ago she tried to transfer her internet service plan to her new home. But as is the case with many low-income communities in the US the ISP didn't serve the Housing Authority of Los Angeles' Imperial Courts. In fact no internet service providers offered speedy plans for any of LA's public housing facilities. Instead they only offered pricey slow plans insufficient for today's needs. So the 45-year-old relied on her smartphone's T-Mobile connection for anything she wanted to do online while her daughter used her phone as a hotspot to attend her virtual film school classes. The mobile devices had unlimited data but came with caveats. "What we found out with unlimited data is it's still limited because they slow your internet down" Wilson said. "If my daughter's online doing school it's terrible waiting all that time." C/NET The clouds of Venus have captivated Earthlings for decades. They form a dazzling mirror that obscures the planet's surface and in the 1950s one Israeli scholar even speculated that the clouds may hide a world teeming with insect life capable of enduring the extreme heat. When Russia's Venera spacecraft took images of the surface in 1975 there were no insects to be found. Venus is a desolate hellscape the victim of a runaway greenhouse effect that has sent temperatures on the ground soaring to well over 850 degrees Fahrenheit -- hot enough to melt lead. But in the clouds more temperate climes await any would-be alien lifeforms. Up in the atmosphere life might just find a way. At least that was one hypothesis. Last year the idea that microbes might call the atmosphere of Venus home was bolstered by a study that claimed to have discovered elevated levels of phosphine -- an unstable gas associated with biological activity -- in the cloud deck of our sister planet. That spawned the theory that microbes in the clouds could be producing the gas. BBC The US Supreme Court has declined to take up a school's appeal in a transgender student bathroom case handing a win to LGBT rights activists. The justices let stand a lower court ruling that a Virginia school had been discriminatory by barring a transgender student from the men's bathroom. The decision marks the end of a six-year legal battle launched by the student Gavin Grimm. It comes amid efforts in some states to limit transgender student rights. Monday's order does not set national precedent on whether schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom that fits their identity. The court did not offer any comment on the refusal of the school appeal as is typical for such orders. BBC Canada has recorded its highest ever temperature as the country's west and the US Pacific north-west frazzle in an unprecedented heatwave. Lytton in British Columbia soared to 46.6C (116F) on Sunday breaking an 84-year-old record officials said. A "heat dome" - static high pressure acting like a lid on a cooking pot - has set records in many other areas. The US and Canada have both warned citizens of "dangerous" heat levels that could persist this week. Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves. However linking any single event to global warming is complicated.

The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) the former governing party in the region said on Monday it was back in control of Mekelle and residents reported seeing troops in Tigray regional uniforms in the city for the first time since November. “The capital of Tigray Mekelle is under our control” Getachew Reda spokesperson for the TPLF told Reuters news agency by satellite phone. Al Jazeera’s correspondent Malcolm Webb speaking from Nairobi Kenya said there were reports of people “celebrating in the streets … and local residents shooting fireworks”. Al Jazeera Iran-backed armed groups have promised revenge as the US defended its air strikes on the groups in Iraq and Syria saying the attacks were designed to limit the risk of escalation. The US military on Sunday said it targeted operational and weapons storage facilities at two locations in Syria and one location in Iraq in response to drone attacks against US personnel and facilities in Iraq. In a statement on Monday Iraqi armed groups aligned with Iran named four members of the Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada faction they said were killed in the attack on the Syria-Iraq border and promised to retaliate. Iraq’s government wary of getting dragged into a US-Iran conflict condemned the strikes on its territory and said it would “study all legal options” to prevent such action being repeated. DW News The United States and several of its European allies voiced concern over the ongoing threat posed by the "Islamic State" (IS) militant group on Monday during an international anti-IS coalition meeting in Italy. The US-led coalition convened in Rome to discuss strategies to combat terrorism. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Monday warned that IS was gaining influence beyond Iraq and Syria where it originated. "The IS in Iraq and Syria has been pushed back but not defeated" Maas said noting the militant group's increasing terrorist activity in Afghanistan and Africa. But Maas ruled out an imminent withdrawal from Mali despite a terror attack last week that left 12 soldiers injured. Reuters June 28 (Reuters) - Rescue workers pulled a 10th body from the rubble of a Florida condominium tower on Monday and the mayor said they would keep searching for survivors five days after the 12-story building collapsed as residents slept. The crews were using cranes dogs and infrared scanners to identify signs of life in the ruins hoping survivors could still be alive in air pockets under the rubble. "We're going to continue and work ceaselessly to exhaust every possible option in our search" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters at a news briefing. She  acknowledged the number of casualties could rise with 151 people still considered missing. Reuters The remainder of this article is behind a pay wall. WASHINGTON June 28 (Reuters) - The White House is working on an antitrust executive order that aims to push government agencies to consider how their decisions will impact competition in an industry according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Vox The airlines are no longer desperate. Gone are the pandemic-era flight deals flexible booking policies and open middle seats. Millions of Americans are traveling again as the weather warms (in some parts of the US) and vaccination rates rise. This is cause for optimism. The joys of normal life — summer vacations and guilt-free social gatherings — are on the horizon. But first the airport. Travel is back and so are its all-too-many inconveniences: long security lines pissed-off passengers boarding mishaps and random airline fees. It’s not good news for summer travelers especially those with trips booked around Independence Day so plan accordingly for all of the above. And it isn’t just that rowdy travelers might be acting up. From a logistical standpoint things have actually gotten worse. The number of flyers daily in the US is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels even though business and international travel have been slow to resume. Airlines and airports have struggled to accommodate this influx which has resulted in longer customer service wait times significant flight delays and sudden cancellations. In some cities airport concession stands and restaurants aren’t fully staffed or open leaving stranded travelers with fewer options for food and beverages. Vox The US long-term care system — such as it is — is broken. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are on waiting lists for home-based care. More than 40 million people report that they have cared for a loved one over 50 without any pay in the last year. The United States ranks near the bottom of developed economies in the number of older adults who receive long-term care at home. Meanwhile America’s nursing homes are staffed by overwhelmed and underpaid workers and for-profit takeovers of those facilities have led to worse care for patients. Covid-19 has made this long-term care crisis impossible to ignore. More than 130000 nursing home residents have died in the pandemic accounting for nearly one in four US deaths. Residents of large institutions died at higher rates than those who live in the community. In America aging people who need care — in a nursing facility or at home — either must be wealthy enough to pay for it themselves or must deplete their income and assets enough that they qualify for Medicaid. Almost by accident the health insurance program for low-income Americans has become the main payer for nursing home and home-based care. Experts describe long-term care in the US with a sense of disbelief. NPR A federal judge has dismissed two blockbuster antitrust complaints against Facebook in a setback to federal and state prosecutors who were pushing for a break-up of the social media giant. The cases filed separately by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 state attorneys general in December accused Facebook of crushing competition by swallowing rivals including Instagram and WhatsApp and stifling other would-be competitors by cutting their access to its valuable data and systems. But Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in Monday's ruling that prosecutors failed to prove Facebook has a monopoly in social networking. NPR The Proud Boys are going local. The last six months have seen dozens of alleged members of the far-right extremist group charged with actions related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. This was followed by even more marginalization of the group by corporate America. And a late January revelation that the national chairman of the organization was once an informant for law enforcement led some chapters to threaten to splinter off. Founded in 2016 as a self-described "Western chauvinist" organization the Proud Boys is defined as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC's Cassie Miller described the Proud Boys ideology as focusing on the principles "that politics should be practiced by force that the country is full of internal enemies that the United States needs to be reborn or renewed in some way." Is an apology enough or should she be under investigation by the FBI?Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's Wife Ginni Thomas Apologizes After Endorsing Trump Rally Where He Encouraged March On Capitol 1/6https://t.co/Ng5HuSoB0k New York Times ORDBEND Calif. — In America’s fruit and nut basket water is now the most precious crop of all. It explains why amid a historic drought parching much of the American West a grower of premium sushi rice has concluded that it makes better business sense to sell the water he would have used to grow rice than to actually grow rice. Or why a melon farmer has left a third of his fields fallow. Or why a large landholder farther south is thinking of planting a solar array on his fields rather than the thirsty almonds that delivered steady profit for years. “You want to sit there and say ‘We want to monetize the water?’ No we don’t” said Seth Fiack a rice grower here in Ordbend on the banks of the Sacramento River who this year sowed virtually no rice and instead sold his unused water for desperate farmers farther south. “It’s not what we prefer to do but it’s what we kind of need to have to. ”These are among the signs of a huge transformation up and down California’s Central Valley the country’s most lucrative agricultural belt as it confronts both an exceptional drought and the consequences of years of pumping far too much water out of its aquifers. Across the state reservoir levels are dropping and electric grids are at risk if hydroelectric dams don’t get enough water to produce power. Washington Post The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s board of trustees has scheduled a special meeting Wednesday that could lead to a vote on tenure for award-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones as the university faces intense controversy over its handling of her appointment as a professor of journalism. UNC officials published a notice of the meeting on Monday afternoon three days before Hannah-Jones was supposed to start on the faculty. There was no agenda item immediately available and a university spokeswoman declined to elaborate. A report Monday from the news site NC Policy Watch citing two unnamed board members said trustees were expected to vote on tenure for Hannah-Jones.
