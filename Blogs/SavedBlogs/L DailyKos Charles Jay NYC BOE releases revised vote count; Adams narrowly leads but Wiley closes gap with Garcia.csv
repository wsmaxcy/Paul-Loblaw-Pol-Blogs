L, NYC BOE releases revised vote count; Adams narrowly leads but Wiley closes gap with Garcia, Charles Jay, 2021-06-30, The inept patronage-ridden New York City Board of Elections has released a fresh tally of ranked choice preferences in the Democratic mayoral primary which shows Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams still holding a narrow lead over former Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia. The BOE had to retract a tabulation of ranked choice preferences that it released on Tuesday because that tally failed to remove about 135000 sample ballot images that had been used to test the ranked-choice voting software. The new tally released Wednesday shows Adams leading Garcia by a margin of 51.1 percent to 48.9 percent the same as yesterday’s tally according to The New York Times. The revised tally showed Adams leading Garcia by less than 15000 vote. Adams had 358521 votes to Garcia’s 343766. But the new figures show a much tighter race between Garcia and civil rights attorney Maya Wiley for second place. The new results show Wiley trailing Garcia by only 347 votes before being theoretically eliminated  after the eighth round of tallies under the city’s new ranked-choice voting system. In the retracted tally Garcia led Wiley by 3800 votes. And these results are only for early voting or in-person voting on Tuesday June 22. There are about 125000 absentee ballots still to be counted and then subjected to the ranked choice elimination process. The final results are not expected until mid-July. While Adams remains the favorite either Wiley or Garcia could still pull off an upset depending on the absentee ballot count. According to The New York TImes:  In prepared statements issued immediately upon the release of the new tally all three candidates projected confidence with Mr. Adams’s campaign saying “There are still absentee ballots to be counted that we believe favor Eric.” Ms. Wiley said “this election is still wide open” and Ms. Garcia called it a “dead heat.”  The ranked choice voting system allows voters to rank up to five candidates on their ballots in preferential order.  Lower-polling candidates are eliminated one by one in separate rounds with their votes distributed to other candidates based on who they ranked next. The process continues until there are two candidates left — one of whom has more than 50 percent of the votes. The BOE did release a statement apologizing to New York City voters “for any confusion” and acknowledging it “must regain the trust of New Yorkers.” “We have implemented another layer of review and quality control before publishing information going forward” said the statement from the board’s commissioners. “We can say with certainty that the election night vote counts were and are accurate and the RCV data put out today is correct as well.” Adams and Garcia are both considered moderates and opposed cutting the NYPD’s budget. Wiley became the consensus choice of progressives after two other candidates City Comptroller Scott Stringer and Dianne Morales a non-profit executive saw their campaigns implode.
