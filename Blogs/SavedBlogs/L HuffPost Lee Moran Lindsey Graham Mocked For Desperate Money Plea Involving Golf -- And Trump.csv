L, Lindsey Graham Mocked For Desperate Money Plea Involving Golf -- And Trump, Lee Moran, 2021-04-28, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) cut off and scolded for pleading for money on Fox News on Tuesday tried out a new pitch — this time invoking Donald Trump. Graham during an appearance on “Hannity” announced he was raffling the chance to play in a golf tournament on Sunday alongside himself and the former president. “The money is going to be used to take back the House and the Senate so we can stop this slide to socialism” Graham blustered to prime-time personality Sean Hannity. “You have lunch you have breakfast with President Trump you get a photo you play at his golf course in Florida. It’s going to be a lot of fun” he added.
