Tonights Selection Tuesday Twofer Celebrates Women In Jazz . . . Bonus Track This band was one of my favorites back in the 70s. They were from Springfield and played the dance hall college circuit in the mid-west. My brother knew guys in a few of the bands in Springfield and I got introduced to some of the players. (I knew John Dillon and Steve Cash before they formed the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. They played as a folk duo for tips and pitchers of beer in a pizza joint.) There was a terrible car accident. There were six? packed in a van with some of their equipment and three? or four? were killed. One of the surviving members was the bass player Don Shipps. He went on to form another similar band - The Titanic Blues Band. About 15 years ago Don died in a house fire. He was a great bass player and just a really good guy to have as a friend. . .
