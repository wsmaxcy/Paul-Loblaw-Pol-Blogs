Tonights Selection Tuesday twofer  A line in the tune is “I feel the reveling. I feel the change on the rise.” I was getting supplies at the grocery store and there is a noticeable difference in the way everybody interacts these days. I’ve known a couple of the employees like the guy behind the meat counter and the florist lady for a few years… one of the checkers for more like 30. I’ll stop and talk to them if it’s slow. Exchanging pleasantries but nothing serious kind of stuff. The other customers were amused at my lame humor as I pushed past them in the aisle with old jokes. “I wish they’d put little bicycle jingle bells on these carts. ‘Scuse me ‘scuse me.” Haha. “I asked the managers to put some traffic lights in here but they won’t listen to me. ‘Scuse me.” Smiling eyes above the masks. The lady waiting in the next line over to check out was singing some tune to herself as she double checked her list. It all had a feeling of… I dunno… lightness that had been missing. It could be any number of factors like what a beautiful spring day it was and/or the hopes and dreams of a new administration and/or somthingsomething. I don’t know why and I guess it really doesn’t matter. But I can feel the change.  .  . . Bonus Track
