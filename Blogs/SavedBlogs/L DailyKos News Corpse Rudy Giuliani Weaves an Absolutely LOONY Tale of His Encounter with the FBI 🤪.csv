L, Rudy Giuliani Weaves an Absolutely LOONY Tale of His Encounter with the FBI ðŸ¤ª, News Corpse, 2021-04-30, On Wednesday the FBI executed a search warrant at the home and office of Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. It was according to Giuliani a travesty on the part of the "Biden Vindictive government" despite the fact that the investigation was launched by Bill Barr's Justice Department when Trump was still in the White House. On Thursday Giuliani visited Fox News in an attempt to extricate himself from the web of deceit he was trapped in due to his own shady dealings. He was "interviewed" by Tucker Carlson the host who Fox News successfully argued in court could not be taken seriously. That was his first mistake. During this segment Giuliani recited his version of what took place when the feds came to his door. It's pretty pathetic script that fails to make any sense or advance his interests. He began by constructing a thoroughly unbelievable exchange involving hard drives that he said belonged to Hunter Biden. Here is how he described the encounter:  Rudy Giuliani tells Tucker Carlson that he offered FBI agents Hunter Biden's hard drives while they raided his residence but they wouldn't take them pic.twitter.com/qxfWoM48XB  Think about how preposterously unlikely all of that is. First of all Giuliani wants us to believe that he was in possession of Hunter Biden's hard drives and that he did nothing with them for two years even though he was obsessed with destroying the Bidens. Then the FBI raids his home and he's suddenly anxious to give them away to agents that he believes are hostile and intent on persecuting him. If there was anything incriminating on those hard drives wouldn't Giuliani want to retain possession of them? Secondly why would the FBI refuse to take these hard drives? Giuliani is insinuating that the agents are operatives of the "Deep State" who want to cover for the Biden family. So wouldn't taking the drives serve that purpose? It would remove them from Giuliani's custody and allow them to "lose" the alleged evidence if that were actually their goal. Thirdly Giuliani's telling of this encounter suggests that the FBI agents vehemently and repeatedly refused to take the hard drives. Are we supposed to believe that just being near the hard drives made the agents visibly nervous and that they would expose their anxieties to the subject of their investigation? Giuliani went on to claim that the agents were "required" to take the alleged hard drives. That's false. They have discretion to take only what they consider to be relevant to the investigation. Giuliani also wondered why the agents would take his word for what the hard drives contained saying that "They could have been Donald Trump's. They could have been Vladimir Putin's." What exactly is he implying and does he really want to go there? By the same token Giuliani is asking us to take his word that any of this happened at all. Finally Giuliani's claim that the evidence seized would be "exculpatory" isn't in the remotest sense plausible. If it were true then why would he be upset about having been served the warrant? He should be pleased that he's about to be exonerated. Clearly his simmering panic indicates that he knows he is in legal peril. Giuliani's appearance on Fox News demonstrates precisely why credible lawyers don't want their clients talking on television. Even when they they think they are among friends. In fact being with Tucker Carlson makes it more likely that Giuliani would feel at ease and thus susceptible to letting something slip that is incriminating. As a lawyer you might think that Giuliani would know this. But as an idiot who has lost some sixty cases related to election fraud on Trump's behalf he has proven that he doesn't have a clue. And he's still Trump's lawyer which should make all the prosecutors investigating him very happy. NOTE: Twitter recently suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
