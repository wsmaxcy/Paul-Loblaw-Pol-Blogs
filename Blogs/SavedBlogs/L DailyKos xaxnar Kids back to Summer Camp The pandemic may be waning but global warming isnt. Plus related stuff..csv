L, Kids back to Summer Camp? The pandemic may? be waning but global warming isn't. Plus related stuff., xaxnar, 2021-07-05, There’s a story by John Schwartz in the New York Times:  Burn bans flashlight campfires extreme heat and stronger rainstorms: Today’s campers are experiencing their summer fun against the backdrop of climate change. It’s a collection of anecdotes from around the country looking at how a warming planet is changing the summer camp experience. Just when it looked like the pandemic was letting up enough to have something like a ‘normal’ summer reality keeps getting in the way. Here’s how it starts: Jill Laidlaw has worked for 37 years at Camp Cavell in Lexington Mich. a little spot of paradise on Lake Huron. But she has seen trouble in paradise: climate change. Temperatures in Michigan have risen by two to three degrees on average in the last century and Ms. Laidlaw said she had seen the effects of that warming in many ways from hotter days and warmer nights to stronger rainstorms harmful algae blooms in the region's lakes and an explosion of ticks. And increasingly common bans on any kind of burning have even restricted one of the most beloved aspects of summer camp she said: “We've had ‘flashlight campfires’ the last few summers.” Climate change which affects many aspects of children’s lives is upending the camp experience as well. After more than a year of pandemic isolation and disrupted schools and social lives the 26 million children who typically attend day and sleep-away camps are ready to get back to summer fun. But the stewards of many of those camps say that the effects of climate change — not to mention the ongoing coronavirus precautions that many camps are dealing with — are making it harder to provide the carefree experiences that past generations enjoyed. Examples from other camps around the country are put in the larger context of climate. Bigger rains bigger droughts hotter nights and days… Change is happening. The comments on the article are especially interesting. People cite personal experiences of their own — and then there are the outright deniers repeating the same bogus talking points. The author responds to some of the comments and it seems his bag of f*cks to give is empty if in a polite way. This article appears to have hit a nerve. It’s sobering to realize that the campers of today are the ones who will be judging us in the near future about the world we’re handing them. Somewhere down the road when those kids are adults being asked to foot the bill for our AC in the assisted living facilities there are going to be some tough choices made. But it’s not all bad news. Elsewhere in The NY Times is a new trend labeled Carbontech. Science can now pull carbon out of the air. For that to make a difference though businesses need to find profitable places to put it. To make a long (and interesting article short) companies are working on ways to create products that lock up more carbon that it takes to manufacture them. The example Jon Gerner starts with is floor carpet tiles… You have probably set foot on Interface products. The company based in Atlanta makes commercial flooring — carpet tiles lightly napped highly durable easily overlooked in the commercial offices and educational facilities where they are mostly in use. When Interface sent me samples of its newest product earlier this year at a glance they seemed banal familiar: These were the marled gray patterns that cover the floors of airport terminals corporate hallways and CVS pharmacies all over the world. How many miles had I walked on those carpets? Yet in their very composition they were something new. This carpeting was a result of four years of intensive research and development according to Interface. It incorporated a material made from recycled vinyl and processed vegetation; it was infused with a latex created from smokestack exhaust. It was topped and tufted with salvaged nylon. And it had been manufactured in the least environmentally demanding way possible. By Interface’s reckoning the carpeting had a carbon footprint of negative 300 grams per square meter. “It’s not a magic material” Erin Meezan chief sustainability officer at Interface told me recently. But the math does have a magical quality to it: In part because of how the carbon is sourced carpeting a 10-feet-by-20-feet conference room say with these tiles can be seen as the equivalent of pulling roughly 12 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. By reusing/recycling materials by making manufacturing as energy efficient as possible by using particular materials by new techniques the idea is to lock up carbon in forms that keep it out of the atmosphere while being both useful and economically practical. The goal is to actually lock up more carbon than is released not just net zero but negative. It’s a new approach with a lot of hurdles to overcome and no guarantees that these processes can be made commercially viable or not without some incentives but there is reason to be somewhat optimistic. In the long run too carbontech might prove to be a good business for some firms. Interface views its negative-carbon tile as a way to serve a raft of increasingly motivated government agencies and companies. Amazon Apple and FedEx are now committed to eventually being carbon neutral and others (like Microsoft) have set their sights on being carbon negative. As companies further define what sustainability means Meezan told me “they’re going to come face to face with the realization that what they’re doing on climate is not adequate.” And when that moment comes she predicted they’ll have to ask: What comes after net-zero carbon? The article is clear that this is not a magic bullet that will solve our carbon problems all by itself — but it’s certainly a move in the right direction. And speaking of directions here’s one more item for your consideration from September 2020 via Pro Publica.  According to new data from the Rhodium Group analyzed by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine warming temperatures and changing rainfall will drive agriculture and temperate climates northward while sea level rise will consume coastlines and dangerous levels of humidity will swamp the Mississippi River valley. Taken with other recent research showing that the most habitable climate in North America will shift northward and the incidence of large fires will increase across the country this suggests that the climate crisis will profoundly interrupt the way we live and farm in the United States. See how the North American places where humans have lived for thousands of years will shift and what changes are in store for your county. emphasis added Take heat alone: Heat is one of the largest drivers changing the niche of human habitability. Rhodium Group researchers estimate that under the RCP 8.5 scenario between 2040 and 2060 extreme temperatures will become commonplace in the South and Southwest with some counties in Arizona experiencing temperatures above 95 degrees for half the year. Unfortunately it’s not just the heat — it IS the humidity. It’s possible for heat and humidity combined to reach levels where humans can’t cool themselves down enough to survive without artificial means. When heat meets excessive humidity the body can no longer cool itself by sweating. That combination creates wet bulb temperatures where 82 degrees can feel like southern Alabama on its hottest day making it dangerous to work outdoors and for children to play school sports. As wet bulb temperatures increase even higher so will the risk of heat stroke — and even death. This will affect both daily activities by humans and food production. The article also looks at effects from increasing wildfires and sea level rise. There is going to have to be serious infrastructure adaptation there will likely be large scale migration and a country that will look very different in a few decades not centuries. The article has interactive graphics showing the different changes predicted according to several scenarios they analyzed. The actual results will likely be even more complicated as the various factors interact with local conditions. For more on wet bulb temperatures Wikipedia has a article about it with this particular nugget: Even heat-adapted people cannot carry out normal outdoor activities past a wet-bulb temperature of 32 °C (90 °F) equivalent to a heat index of 55 °C (130 °F). The theoretical limit to human survival for more than a few hours in the shade even with unlimited water is 35 °C (95 °F) – theoretically equivalent to a heat index of 70 °C (160 °F) though the heat index does not go that high.[3] If you are a sociopathic billionaire with dynastic ambitions you may want to contemplate a long-term real estate plan and strategic acquisitions. Here are some maps for your consideration. (Mind they’re not just looking at climate — they're also thinking about social unrest.) This video came out in 2009. Things have not gotten better since then. We can’t say we weren’t warned.
