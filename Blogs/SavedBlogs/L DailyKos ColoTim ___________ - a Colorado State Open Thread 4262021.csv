L, ___________ - a Colorado State Open Thread 4/26/2021, ColoTim, 2021-04-26, The Colorado State Open Thread is usually written on a trending topic or something of interest to people about the state of Colorado in the hearts and minds of fans everywhere.  But not today. Today I’m not in position to write my weekly open thread so this will truly be open.  I have no thoughts at this time because I’m writing this diary ahead of time and queuing it up for you folks to have at it tonight free from the oversight I give to these open thread diaries.  You may truly write to your hearts’ content hijack threads post pictures even talk about non-Colorado themes and people.  I won’t care until I read this sometime in the future.  As a result I even invite you to think about how you might like to write a diary to fill in for me on the odd occasion of my absence.  As for tonight as I’ve often said with my plagiarized catch-phrase the floor is yours.
