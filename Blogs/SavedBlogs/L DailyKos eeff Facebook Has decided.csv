L, Facebook Has decided, eeff, 2021-05-05, I’m in shock  I Tell You JUST IN: " The Board has upheld Facebook’s decision on January 7 2021 to restrict then-President Donald Trump’s access to posting content on his Facebook page and Instagram account." I really am surprised ! I thought facebook would allow the orange menace back on their platform ! I think the world got a break from facebook over this! From the Hill Facebook will not let Trump back on platform Facebook's ban on former President Trump’s account will continue following a decision issued by its independent oversight board Wednesday. "The Board found that in maintaining an unfounded narrative of electoral fraud and persistent calls to action Mr. Trump created an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible" the board wrote in a statement. While the board did uphold the suspension it also found that the indefinite suspension was not appropriate. The panel is requesting that Facebook review the decision to develop a "proportionate response that is consistent with the rules that are applied to other users of its platform."  The Board has upheld Facebook’s decision on January 7 to suspend then-President Trump from Facebook and Instagram. Trump’s posts during the Capitol riot severely violated Facebook’s rules and encouraged and legitimized violence.  https://t.co/veRvWpeyCi
