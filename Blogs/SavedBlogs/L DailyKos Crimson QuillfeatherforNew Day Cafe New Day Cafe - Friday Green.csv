L, New Day Cafe - Friday: Green, Crimson QuillfeatherforNew Day Cafe, 2021-04-30, Good morning Newdists. Today is the first Friday after president Biden’s first SOTU. I hope you all are well on the way to your second jab in the arm and immunity. So will you be wearing masks outdoors? Will you still wash your hands? I plan on not getting the flu for a while and will be doing both. Why waste all that hand sanitizer and spray alcohol and all those pretty masks eh?   Fave tweets this week —   100 days. pic.twitter.com/M5ycQiwCFB  .  Nice chairs. Big flag. Depth. Experience.

Newdists I would like to give up my weekly diaries. Of course that means I am looking for someone or sometwo to take my Friday and Saturday timeslots for diaries.
