C, The Geek in Pictures: Cancel Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-16, Now here’s a depressing survey out this week. The left likes to say that “cancel culture” is just as prevalent on the right as it is on the left but take a look at this chart and see if you spot a conspicuous difference:  This finding comes from the 2021 American College Student Freedom Progress and Flourishing Survey just out from the Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. The survey sampled over 1000 students at 71 colleges and universities (see page 2 for a complete description of the methodology and demographic breakdown). Not all of the survey’s findings are bleak but these two charts certainly suggest where the most energy is to be found for forming online cancel mobs. Meanwhile elsewhere in campus and political news:          And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
