L, 190 House Republicans Vote To Cover-Up GQP Terrorism With Opposition To 1/6 Committee, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-07-05, Remember these legislators and their malevolence in 2022. I just want to say that the woman who was shot at the Capitol on Jan 6 was a rioting terrorist trying to break down a door. It’s on tape! Republicans’ attempts to turn her into a martyr are lies and disgusting and I won’t have it.    ​ These are the 120 Republicans who voted against removing confederate statues from the Capitol pic.twitter.com/GW4Y64WBKO  ​ I'm somewhat of a history buff and I'm pretty sure that the Nazis didn't have to first agree in order for there to be investigations and trials after WWII.  70 times as many GOP House Members - 70 times - voted to overturn 2020 election results. https://t.co/58ZSYh0Npg  How to Spot a CultAccording to Amanda Montell’s new book “Cultish” the jargon and technical language of fanaticism is surprisingly common. https://t.co/sSo2t8mFo4  After pretty much every major platform either suspended or banned Trump for posts that moderators saw as encouraging the Capitol riot the former president and some of his supporters have been trying to find a new social media home. Trump and his team had reportedly been in talks over the past year for him to join two other conservative-leaning platforms Parler and Gab though the negotiations ultimately went nowhere.

Trump” though he decided to shutter the platform due to poor readership and people making fun of him. Last weekend he ended up joining Rumble a YouTube clone popular among conservatives where he livestreamed his rally in Ohio. He’s also been teasing the release of his own platform to compete with Facebook which is apparently separate from GETTR though the details of the forthcoming project are scant. slate.com/...
