L, America needs to wake up!, RRG3DAV, 2021-05-04, I heard Moscow Mitch whining and telling the “woke corporations” to “stay out of politics” WTF? What is this that the GOP are talking about when they call corporations that oppose their views as “woke corporations”? Does it mean that those that are “woke” woke up from the GOP dreamland? Does that mean that the GOP is asleep? That would explain a lot about the alternate universe they seem to be in a dream world. No wonder they don’t know how to govern it’s hard to meet the people’s needs with your eyes closed and your mind in a dream world that doesn’t exist in reality. They need think-tanks to write legislation for them because they don’t have a clue about real life. Their think-tanks don’t have a clue either that’s why what they write is all about mid-evil “laws” are they playing a video game? These people that are asleep need serious professional help if they can get out of bed and open their eyes long enough to get it. Dreamland it’s the only place they feel safe in. I think America may be waking up and rubbing her eyes in disbelief. It’s going to be one helluva rude awakening and a long mourning for what we’ve lost. Wake up it’s time to fix this nation! A parting line from one of my favorite Mel Brooks movies: “They’re getting all of their air back! Somebody DO something!” — Spaceballs the movie
