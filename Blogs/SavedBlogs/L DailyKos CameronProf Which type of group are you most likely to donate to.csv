L, Which type of group are you most likely to donate to?, CameronProf, 2021-04-30, There are so many charitable causes I can not list them all….but I will attempt to:  International Aid Animal Welfare Religious/Spiritual Minority Group Support Health Education Art/Culture Community Development Environmental.  I am sure people will find fault with the categories...either they are too broad or not broad enough etc. Therefore i am going to leave categorization of your most frequent charity type up to you and not have a poll.  For me I’d say I spend a lot of a little that I have on charity. I do not have much but when I do I spend a lot of it to charities. I would guesstimate the following percentage break-down 60 percent International 30 percent animal welfare 10 percent health/wellness How about yourself? 10
