L, Just Sayn' it's worth taking 3 mins to watch Val Demings take down former wrestler Jim Jordan, HalBrown, 2021-04-21, Rep. Val Demings wasn’t a  champion wrestler and a wrestling coach like Jim Jordan was. Jordan wrestled in high school. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison he became a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion. Jordan won the 1985 and 1986 NCAA championship matches in the 134-pound weight class. Wikipedia. Val Demings was a police officer who rose to the position of Chief of Police in Orlando. In this interchange with Jim Jordan she takes him down like an Olympic gold medal wrestler. You may have seen or read about this in the news. It was hard to miss. According to Newsweek the video was viewed 2 million times. Clips were shown on MSNBC this morning. She was interviewed on “Morning Joe” where former senator Claire McCaskill  asked if she was planning to run for senator. Demings obviously wasn’t ready to answer.  It is just a coincidence that a wrestling match or bout is seven minutes long. The first period lasts three minutes and the second and third periods each last two minutes. If you take out Rep. Nadler’s interruptions round this out and you could say Val Demings demolished him in the first period and pinned him in the last seconds. I suggest watching the entire 3:06 minutes: It's interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it's politically convenient to do so but not when police officers who protect us every day here at the Capitol were fighting for their lives because of the Big Lie. @HouseJudiciary pic.twitter.com/x9i9LO5AAi  Tomorrow’s diary: Just Sayn' I've been in prisons and jails and can say that Derek Chauvin is having a rude awakening
