L, Changing the rules? Don’t treat us like fools!, Joyce Siegel, 2021-05-04, It’s more than mean spirited and worse than sardonicit’s anti American and patently  ironicthat Republicans seek constraints to voter participationby controlling access to voting through legislative alteration.Republicans are seeking greater polling successby limiting opportunities for broad voter access.They’re making it much harder for some folks to voteand as new rules are adopted just watch these folks gloat.Americans who care about democracy and how it worksMust put a stop to those unpatriotic anti-voter jerks!In state after state they’ve been changing the rulesWe can’t let them treat us like powerless fools.Pressure your senators to adopt the House Bill One legislationThat will protect access to voting throughout our whole nation.
