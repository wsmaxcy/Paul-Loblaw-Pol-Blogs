SUPREME COURT WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court upholds Arizona voting restrictions.  Justice Kagan dissenting: "Today the Court undermines Section 2 and the right it provides. The majority fears that the statute Congress wrote is too 'radical'—that it will invalidate too many state voting laws. So the majority writes its own set of rules limiting Section 2."  Justice Kagan dissenting: "What is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again) rewritten—in order to weaken—a statute that stands as a monument to America's greatness and protects against its basest impulses."  Justice Kagan dissenting: "By declaring some racially discriminatory burdens inconsequential and by refusing to subject asserted state interests to serious means-end scrutiny the majority enables voting discrimination."  Justice Kagan dissenting: "Arizona’s ballot-collection ban violates Section 2. The ban interacts with conditions on the ground—most crucially disparate access to mail service—to create unequal voting opportunities for Native Americans."  Justice Kagan in the last graf of her dissent:"This Court has no right to remake Section 2.""That law of all laws deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law of all laws should not be diminished by this Court."  REP.
