L, A FREE gun for every Black American!, LimitReached, 2021-04-26, I can’t think of a faster way to bring about change than to force change to happen. SCOTUS take note. If I purchased a gun for every legally eligible Black American and gave it to them free or threatened to do so there would be sensible gun laws on the books so fast it would make your head spin. Let’s face it the good ol boys club has no problem letting “the people” have guns and open carry while waiving a Second Amendment flag as long at those Americans have a certain skin color. But the thought of Black Americans having more guns than white Americans would  scare the shit out of them and gun regulations would be passed so fast you wouldn’t know what hit you. Disclaimer: 1.) I am not going to buy anyone a gun. 2.) I know that this logic implies that America is racist. 3.) This is a thought exercise not a threat. Don’t pile on me for speaking the truth.
