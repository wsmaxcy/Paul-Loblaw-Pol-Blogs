L, Georgia Gov. Signed Voter Suppression Law Under Portrait Of Plantation, Jen Hayden DailyKos, 2021-03-28, On Thursday Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a viciously anti-voter law that would among other things penalize people for simply handing  out water or snacks to people waiting in hours-long lines. (Lines that  are long by design.) In fact the bill is so blatantly designed to  suppress the vote in Georgia that it includes nearly 100 pages of new voter restrictions.  There is no question these restrictions are racist in nature from  the first to the last. As Nsé Ufot of The New Georgia Project told Kos and Kerry Eleveld on an episode of The Brief  this bill and others like them are a “whitelash” response to the  success of Stacey Abrams The New Georgia Project Fair Fight and the  campaigns of Sens. Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.    As bad as this bill is there is another sinister element to this  bill signing which took place as six white men looked over the shoulder  of Kemp. Philadephia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch noticed the  painting behind Kemp and rattled off a Twitter thread about the  historical significance of that painting and the plantation depicted in  it. Buckle up folks—this is going to be infuriating. 2. Notice the antebellum-style portrait behind Kemp as he signs the suppression law?

Kemp and a gaggle of white men signed a bill that is a legal monument to white supremacy under a painting of a plantation that is a monument to white supremacy slavery and Georgia’s (as well as America’s) painful past.
