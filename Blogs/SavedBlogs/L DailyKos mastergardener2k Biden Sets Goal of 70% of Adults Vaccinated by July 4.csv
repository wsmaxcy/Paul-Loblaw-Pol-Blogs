L, Biden Sets Goal of 70% of Adults Vaccinated by July 4, mastergardener2k, 2021-05-04, President Joe Biden set a new goal of having 70% of adult American vaccinated for Covid (with at least one dose) by the Fourth of July. About 56.4% of adults in the US were vaccinated with a dose as of yesterday. The pace of vaccinations has slowed dramatically with only 376937  having been vaccinated with their first shots on Monday according to the CDC. To reach the goal we will need another 35 million willing arms in 60 days. There is likely to be more than adequate supplies of vaccine even considering some going for second doses and some used to inject juveniles as they are approved to receive the vaccines. Pharmacies hospitals clinics and doctors will continue to vaccinate even after the large vaccination centers close. The problem will be getting to people who are willing but unable and convincing those who are reluctant. Persuasion and incentives will have to take a major role. www.nytimes.com/… Roughly a third of the unvaccinated population said a cash payment would make them more likely to get a shot. This suggests that some governors may be on the right track; West Virginia’s governor Jim Justice for example recently announced the state would give young people $100 bonds if they got an inoculation... Similarly large increases in willingness to take vaccines emerged for those who were asked about getting a vaccine if doing so meant they wouldn’t need to wear a mask or social-distance in public compared with a group that was told it would still have to do those things.  www.cnn.com/… “I think we're going to be able to do it and I think it's by changing a little bit of the strategy – getting out of the mass vaccination approach and really putting in walk-in capabilities in 40000 or so pharmacies throughout the country getting mobile units going getting the local capability of accessibility rather than these broad mass vaccination sites” Fauci told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.  The fact that senior American are now well vaccinated with 82.9% over the age of 65 having taken at least one jab suggests Americans will get vaccinated if they have a good enough reason. Even the age cohort of 50 to 64 year-olds have been receiving their injections with 63.6% getting at least one dose.  Currently the six New England states New Jersey Hawaii and New Mexico exceed 65% of adults vaccinated. Mississippi lags at 40.8% of adults vaccinated.
