C, Saturday Night With the Outsiders, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-19, Outsiders is an excellent program on Australia’s Sky News hosted by Rowan Dean Rita Panahi and James Morrow. I was on the show Saturday night talking about the Derek Chauvin trial the lawlessness that reigns in Minnesota and who is really running the “Biden administration.” The segment is just six minutes long and I think is entertaining. It has already racked up an impressive 314000 views on YouTube:  There is or was an Australian TV show called Insiders that featured the usual liberal establishment types. Sky News started Outsiders as a conservative counterpoint. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
