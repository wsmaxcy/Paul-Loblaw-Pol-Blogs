L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing ~ 5.10.21~ questions 67 & 68, ZenTrainerforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-05-10, I do have some questions — #67 How do I tell the time to set my new alarm clock? We had some big storms a few weeks ago and twice in one night my power went out. The 2nd time my more than 25 year old clock radio blew up. I had no time to mess around so I ran up to the Dollar store and bought the $4 clock pictured above. The problem is that I can’t figure out how to set the alarm clock. It took me forever to understand that those little line things stood for minutes. I honestly thought they were breaking up each hour but I couldn’t figure out in what increments. I would only need 4 of those lines to mark each ¼ of the hour. For the life of me I couldn’t figure out why there were 5. Until I realized they marked the minutes in an hour. With a digital clock I like to set the alarm for times like 10:18. Now it’s just a crap shoot. Duh. Analog.   Question #68 Why can’t I leave my pants on if I’m only having surgery on the top half of my body? I have a new diagnosis of breast cancer (again 10 years later). I originally had a lot more than 2 questions but after having my first surgeon answer incorrectly or dishonestly I fired him and hired a new surgeon. The only question I have left is why do I need to take my pants off for breast surgery? I haven’t heard a good answer yet but I’m trying to be a good patient (ha!) and comply so I’ll probably take my pants off. I haven’t heard when my surgery date will be either. My new surgeon is doing more tests. One for genetic cancer markers and an MRI. My team is pretty good though and says the type of surgery is up to me. Now if only I was in charge of scheduling. I want to get it over. I’m going to be gone from KTK for 6 weeks to 2 months as I have to stay off the internet. 10 years ago when I went on line under the influence of pain meds I bought over $100 worth of light switch covers. Nice switch covers but still... I’ll be back!
