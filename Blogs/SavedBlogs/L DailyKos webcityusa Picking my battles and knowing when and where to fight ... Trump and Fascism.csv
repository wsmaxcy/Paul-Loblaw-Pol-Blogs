L, Picking my battles and knowing when and where to fight ... Trump and Fascism, webcityusa, 2021-07-01, Time is not on our side so I can't be distracted and I need all the support I can get. That's my motto as I get prepared for the most important elections of our lives.  It may seem too early to be thinking about the mid-terms and 2024. But the Republican Party is far ahead in this game. And it's not a game but our lives I'm talking about.  There have always been those who have had their own motivations for doing what they do. It all may seem like a horrible joke or nightmare now that Trump is out of office. It's been said that his run for the presidency was just a publicity stunt to advertise the Trump brand. Never expecting to win ... then he won.  Trump refused to divest from his companies and refused to disclose the cost of his Inauguration where funds were reported missing.  Trump's wife didn't move right away into the White House so there was extra Secret Service protection at Trump Tower. So many trips to his own properties and Trump charged top dollar to the Secret Service for staying in his own hotels plus the use of golf carts.  Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin took numerous trips to the Middle East on the taxpayers' dime. From Hatch act and ethics violations to nepotism and cronyism Trump Ignored all the rules where he and all his friends profited.  The Secret Service had to follow his adult children to all the most expensive resorts and then extended that protection to some who were questionable to receive that type of protection after he left the presidency.  I share all of this only to bring a different point of view or perspective to a very important issue currently in the news. To show things from a different set of lenses. My goal to have all hands on deck for voter rights and not to lose support because some may have mixed feelings about something I did or said.  I've experienced racism and discrimination many times during my childhood and adult life. In past Daily Kos diaries I have reflected back on too many black lives lost too soon. But still I grew up with a love and respect for the country I still hold today. I’ve never served in the military but respect those who did.  I was a sports season ticket holder during the time when many people were following Colin Kaepernick's lead taking a knee while the national anthem played.  Being a recent season ticket holder for both the San Jose Earthquakes and Golden State Warriors I have attended many games where the national anthem was played or sung before the start of each game.  I remember during the pre-game ceremony for the San Jose Earthquakes a number of season ticket holders were invited onto the pitch/field just prior to the national anthem being sung or played.   We would line up with different team flags and spell out something like "Go Quakes" or San Jose Earthquakes with our bodies. Never did I think of doing anything other than just stand there.   I'm reminded while on vacation   In Vancouver Canada my wife and I had front-row seats very close to the center of the pitch/field for the game between the San Jose Earthquakes and the Vancouver WhiteCaps. I remember making sure all those around me were aware I was for the opposing team by wearing my Earthquakes gear proudly. Also hoping I would be spotted by the San Jose Earthquakes TV broadcast crew.   Never did I once think to do anything that might reflect poorly on the team city or country for that matter ... knowing that the national anthem would be played just before the Canadian anthem.  Like I said earlier I have experienced many forms of racism. As I write this keep in mind it's not about me. It's not about what I have had to  endure. Yet the fight is far from over. Our fight now is for the country and what kind of future it can be inclusive welcoming and truly free.   I'm happy to have the new national holiday in Juneteenth but what I really want is to have free and fair elections where I know my vote is counted.  We have a very long road and not much time so my focus is on free and fair elections now so that there might be free and fair elections in the future.  I will never have the platform or position that Gwen Berry has to protest police brutality. I'm not here to say that Tommie Smith and John Carlos were wrong and George Foreman was right in the 1968 Olympics.   But for me Gwen Berry's "protest" didn't really look like a protest and just seemed more just disrespectful than anything. I know it was hot ms. Berry said it was very hot. But yet her demeanor didn't reflect to me happiness or pride to make the team.  Gwen Berry - "the anthem has been scheduled to play at around 5:20pm every evening at trials .. on Saturday the music started at 5:25 while the hammer throwers were on the podium" ...  “Like I said SET UP !! 5 min is longer than you think."  The nation is watching and soon the whole world will be watching. I'm not trying to show a contrast between Tommie Smith John Carlos Gwen Barry or even George Foreman. But I am trying to show and say we need as much support as we can get for multiple causes from fighting police brutality climate change support for We The People Act to fighting Trump racism and fascism. I've already shown what a joke and waste of time and money he was.  Standing on the US flag or kneeling while the national anthem is being played burning the flag or even just raising a fist in the air may show your commitment to a cause. But personally for me I need more "People Power" support that's not going to be turned off before the fight really begins.  I can't see Val Demings who was one of the impeachment managers and is now running to replace fascist Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate in Florida doing what Gwen Berry did. Furthermore I can't see former President Obama with his continued power and audience doing what Gwen Berry did even when his successor was truly a racist and fascist. I can't see Vice President Kamala Harris who may one day be president ever doing what Gwen Berry did. And if any of those just mentioned did they would quickly lose all their current status as great leaders.  I want to avoid giving right-wing news media and fascist anything that might distract from my ultimate goal. The ultimate goal gaining as many supporters for voting rights. So we continue to be a democracy.  Fox "News" is constantly searching the internet for talking points. I'm not going to do anything to make it easy for them to sway potential voters to the far-right.  There is much work to do and not much time to do it. We have to be mindful of our actions because you never know who's watching.  If the goal is to keep Trump from regaining the presidency and make sure we remain a democracy I prefer not to be the focus. If the goal is to bring attention to continued police brutality and racism I don't want all eyes on me and not the goal.  I don't want to go back to the time of waste and fraud under Trump. Family members wouldn't stop Trump's false claims of tax audit or voter fraud because for them there's still more money to be made.  We may never have an accurate accounting of funds lost ... and I don't want to go back in time to continue living in a world of fascism and fantasies.  I also know that racism and injustices are not going away on their own. And that there are those who are and will never see the message we are trying to convey because of their own built-in prejudices. But I don't want to make it easy for them by my own actions.   I had no hesitation during a George Floyd protest in Hayward CA taking a knee and holding it there for almost nine minutes. The pain I had while my knee was on the hard concrete could never come close to the agony and suffering Mr. Floyd felt as his life was slowly squeezed from his body.  Some of my following comments may not sit well with others but I will do my best to explain my position. Many may not agree with my reflections on Gwen Berry's protest in Oregon. My only hope is that you will hear me out. Even as I write the following lines of thought I still have mixed feelings.  It's a personal choice and I get it how some athletes have reached a level of success that you have a national and world stage. I get it. But there's a time for everything and I'm not sure if this is the time or place for this protest. I may be wrong.  Like I said earlier never did I once think about kneeling during the national anthem a personal choice. God knows I have plenty to kneel about but haven't.  I don't know if Gwen Berry should be removed from the hammer throw team and not be an Olympian. I will leave that up to the powers that be. My hope is that the USA hammer throw team would place first second and third place. We've wasted plenty of time on a wasted presidency and we're still paying a high cost for Trump with fake voter audits. Our climate is out of control partly because the other guy says everything is fake and rigged.   After four long years of Trump and fascism we have been set back from so many priorities. I want to make sure that the battles we fight are with those on the far-right and not among ourselves. Each possible vote is needed that we might not return to the dark days of doom.  It's not just knowing when and where to fight my battles but also how. Yes I still have mixed feelings regarding Gwen Berry and the platform she has chosen (Pun intended but not achieved). I stand in solidarity with all those working for a more just world. But again I have to be strategic not only in what battles I choose to fight but when and how.  "A ban on protests and demonstrations" at the Tokyo Olympics will be in place ... no kind of demonstrations or political religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites venues or other areas."  I know that Gwen Berry an "Activist Athlete" will have many opportunities to make a statement for change as she has in the past. I truly wish her the best. Likewise I also know she has not committed to all the rules stated above.  The spotlight should not be on me because the causes we fight for require a group effort a mass showing. I met former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke when he was campaigning in Oakland CA. At the time impeachment of Trump was my driving force to attend too many rallies and protests to count.  Of course I've met with my congressman Eric Swalwell another former presidential candidate to voice my concerns about Trump. My name is not going to be on the six o'clock news because of it. Nor do I want it to be.  There's not a lot of time and no margin for error. Yes Trump is out of office but these state legislators are working overtime because of his continued leadership. We can either work together as a whole body with one goal or talk about tactics and antics. Fascism is knocking at the door how we respond might determine our fate.   Gwen Berry - "I fell like it was a setup" "At this point y'all are obsessed with me".  Only time will tell what a person's true motivations are heaven knows we've given Trump more than enough time. www.msnbc.com/… thehill.com/...
