Some critics suggested mocking titles for Pence’s upcoming autobiography slated for 2023 publication. It will chronicle his journey “from a small town in Indiana to Washington DC” according to the publisher’s news release. “I did it his way” one person quipped about a name for the memoir referencing Pence’s complicity in Donald Trump’s White House: Another added: “It’ll be a downloadable PDF as there’s no chance it has a spine.” They have pre-released all the salient information contained in the book in two pages: pic.twitter.com/0x6E7eOAue Volume 1 - How I Allowed AIDS to Kill People in IndianaVolume 2 - How I Helped Trump Allow Covid19 to Kill People in the United States. First prize is a book from Mike Pence. Second prize? Two books from Mike Pence. Title of the Mike Pence book : 'The Day My Boss Tried To Kill Me' @simonschuster I have a great title/cover idea for the new Mike Pence book. DM me if you want my rates!!! pic.twitter.com/Msp7YVtCMl Mike Pence should title his book ‘Dangerously Bland.’ Mike Pence book title "I did it his way--" https://t.co/KK5IvxwV9U the first book title: "why did people hate my boss"the second book title: "how I dodged the execution" pic.twitter.com/l2UWQlnpCs "Currently Untitled" is a great title for a book about Mike Pence. https://t.co/26kQoDlWNK That's the clever title of the book Covid-500k: The Faith of Mike Pence Will be legit disappointed if the fly doesn’t provide the forward to Mike Pence’s book It'll be a downloadable PDF as there's no chance it has a spine. Working title: "Are you there God? It's me Mike ... ... Mike Pence. No PENCE. It's Mike Pence here. Hello?" "Honey My Boss Tried to Get Me Killed" could be a good title. In my own words: How I Mismanaged a Pandemic “Art of the Kneel?” Against the Mike Pence book deal but “American Coward: My Joyless Sexless Life as a Lackey” is a great title. I am committed to reading Mike Pence’s book if he titles it “Mother” The title of Mike Pence's book is "A Fly On The Wall And Other Places". Mike Pence doesn’t have two single original thoughts to even fill two pages worth of material for a book so expect a lot of variations of —I ❤️Donald Trump.I ❤️Donald Trump.I ❤️Donald Trump.I ❤️Donald Trump.I ❤️Donald Trump.I ❤️Donald Trump.I ❤️Donald Trump. https://t.co/2vTPfXgDBv Mike Pence signs book deal..Light romance a bit of saucy slap and tickle or a whodunnit?
