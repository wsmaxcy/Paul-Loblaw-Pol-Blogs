L, The bulk of the case against Trump’s company will likely be handled by Cy Vance’s successor., annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-07-01,  In a firm like Trump’s the CEO perhaps another unindicted co-conspirator #1 will be held accountable. “I alone can fix it” including the two sets of books.    Trump in a written statement issued shortly after the indictment repeated his assertion that the prosecution was political in nature. “The political Witch Hunt by the Radical Left Democrats with New York now taking over the assignment continues” he wrote. “It is dividing our Country like never before!” Although the indictments could pose trouble for the former president exposing his company to potential fines and intensifying pressure on Weisselberg neither the former president nor anyone else in his firm is expected to face charges this week. Prosecutors hope Weisselberg will offer testimony against Trump in exchange for lessening his own legal risk according to a person familiar with the case. www.washingtonpost.com/… www.washingtonpost.com/... Trump was distressed when he learned of this perp walk.  I can’t stop laughing at it!Trump fumed 'I can't believe it' as he watched Weisselberg being arraigned in handcuffs: ABC News reporter https://t.co/f2MUZNB5sv  BOOM. Donald. J. Trump's. Signature.It's *very likely* that he can be held legally responsible for this fraud scheme as a result of that signature. pic.twitter.com/hpYeAvkepD  ❗️❗️The Trump Organization-Weisselberg Indictment alleges a FEDERAL tax fraud scheme. Charges are serious and documented enough and DA believes can prove beyond a reasonable doubt so question is:Where is the Garland Justice Department/IRS?Are the feds coming next? https://t.co/zWgEKC8pnJ pic.twitter.com/8pVjmKkTrx  ❗️❗️The Trump Organization-Weisselberg Indictment alleges a FEDERAL tax fraud scheme.

That’s stealing from the American people.If Weisselberg had two sets of books that’s damning evidence. No one should be above the law. Not the former President’s company and not his friends. https://t.co/iL6IvhjTSC  Wonder how New York State criminal trials work all of a sudden?Me too!So I asked three former Manhattan assistant district attorneys.(for @forbes)https://t.co/OGLsFdiFwa  pic.twitter.com/qg46YtWkcs  I have a dream#LockHimUp #TrumpOrganization #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison pic.twitter.com/Lt52oWjFb0  QAnon fans were initially excited about new MAGA social app Gettr but they're growing irate as moderators fail to keep lewd anime pics and the "pig poop balls" meme out of the QAnon hashtag. One of the top results now features Sonic the Hedgehog crushing a guy with his feet.  So Donald Trump now asks: "Who shot Ashli Babbitt?"The answer: Have you no shame? Look in the mirror. It is you who are in large measure responsible for her death. She was in D.C. because of you. She stormed the Capitol because of you. She is not alive now because of you.  Donald Trump is holding a rally in Florida on Saturday. Ron DeathSantis does not want you to retweet this. pic.twitter.com/u9bUWHhEr5  His personal lawyer went to jail. His former campaign manager went to jail. His National security advisor should have gone to jail. Roger Stone. Rick Gates. The coffee boy. Rudy getting raided. I’m sure I’m leaving some out but now with his CFO it’s all criminals all the time.
