L, Alaska legislator banned from flights to capital., liberaldad2, 2021-04-26, An Alaska state legislator Sen. Lora Reinbold is now banned from flights on Alaska Airlines the only carrier from her home in Anchorage to the capital in Juneau. She has refused to wear a mask and fought with airline employees once too many times for their comfort.  Alaska Airlines this weekend banned Reinbold “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy” the airline said in a statement to The Washington Post. And this. Reinbold scrambled on Sunday to get to Juneau via an arduous 14-plus-hour car ride including a jaunt through Canada to reach a ferry to the capital. She wrote on Facebook: “Alaska I went to new heights to serve you & have a new appreciation for the marine ferry system.” Welcome to the real world. I had to double check to see if she’s a Republican or Democrat turns out my wild guess was correct. LOL
