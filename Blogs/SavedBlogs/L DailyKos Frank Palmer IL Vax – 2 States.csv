L, IL Vax – 2 States, Frank Palmer, 2021-07-06,  Taken as a whole Illinois looks like one of the better-vaccinated states.  In terms or the president’s goal the CDC lists us as having given 71.8% of our adults at least their first shot by 4 July. If we missed getting half our total population fully vaccinated by the 4th we came close enough 48.61% to expect to pass 50% by Bastille Day the 14th.   Sorted on a finer grain the county level however a different picture emerges. If the USA is becoming 2 nations in respect to vaccination Illinois is the tale of 2 states. Call the first “greater Chicago.” It’ a cluster of 7 relatively populous counties in the Northeast corner of the state. (Chicagoans call the rest “Downstate “ but some dKos participants who live there object to that name.) Greater Chicago has 66.98% of the state’s population but more than 79% of the fully vaccinated. Of the greater-Chicago population 50.54% is fully vaccinated.  Equally if not more important the weak link in that chain of seven Kane County has 47.45% of its population fully vaccinated.  The rest of the state is not so well protected. On average 41.92% of its population is fully vaccinated. This 42% is however distributed very granularly. Sangamon County which contains the state capital is at 48.34% and Champaign County which holds the University is at 47.14. They are a little better than and nearly as good as Kane. To drive from one to the other though you’d go through Macon and Platt counties at 37.27% and 41.70% fully vaccinated respectively.  And there are a few hotspots in waiting; Alexander County at 14.34% is the worst.
