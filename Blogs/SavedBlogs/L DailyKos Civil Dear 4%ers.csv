L, Dear 4%ers, Civil, 2021-05-11, Good Morning to all even the roughly 4% of my fellow Californians who signed a #recall petition which includes the following grievances (February 2020): "Laws he endorsed favor foreign nationals in our country illegally over that of our own citizens. People in this state suffer the highest taxes in the nation the highest homelessness rates and the lowest quality of life as a result. He has imposed sanctuary state status and fails to enforce immigration laws. He unilaterally over-ruled the will of the people regarding the death penalty. He seeks to impose additional burdens on our state by the following; removing the protections of Proposition 13 rationing our water use increasing taxes and restricting parental rights.” (Source https://abc7.com/governor-newsom-recall-update-gavin-california-election-why-is-being-recalled/10559972/) To the credit of the petition author the ‘spilt milk’ grievance was not included. If you 4%ers read the above and are now thinking  ‘Oh. Wait. That makes no sense’  you have until June 8th to ‘withdraw’ your signature by contacting your County Registrar of Voters. Admittedly this will require a greater expenditure of energy than that of signing a petition brought to you by someone who was paid to do so. Dear 4%ers Your grievance airing is likely to cost CA taxpayers $400 million. “The sum is the same amount Newsom earmarked for school-based mental health services in his 2021-22 state budget proposal and more than the $353 million he proposed for workforce development.” “How does the party of fiscal responsibility plan to defend the costs of the recall? By blaming the state Legislature for forcing an election by mail: “We’re not responsible for the cost of this” said Randy Economy a spokesman for the recall campaign. “The Legislature changed the rules in the middle of the game”” a specious reference to ‘vote by mail’ which many CA’s did even prior to the global pandemic. (Source: https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/01/hey-california-taxpayers-guess-how-much-the-newsom-recall-election-is-going-to-cost-you/) But hey at least @Newtgingrich @HuckPac @RNC to name a few will enjoy their ongoing grift and Caitlyn Jenner a porn star Richard Grenell Randy Quaid Kanye West et al.  will get their second 15 minutes of fame. Grifters ‘got to grift grievers ‘got to grieve and CA will always be the go-to bugaboo for “Conservatives”. Oh and… wear masks and get vaxxed: Public health does not care about your politics. Don’t forget to tip Gov Newsom and CAL Fire if you are rescued from a fire amidst a drought. Sincerely Civil
