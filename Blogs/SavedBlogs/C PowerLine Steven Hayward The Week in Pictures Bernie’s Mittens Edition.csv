C, The Week in Pictures: Bernie’s Mittens Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-01-23, Joe Biden was the supposed “moderate” in the Democratic field but 72 hours in is there anything Pres. Biden has done so far that Bernie Sanders wouldn’t have done just as fast? Perhaps it is more than symbolic that the leading image that emerged from the inauguration is Bernie sitting alone in a folding chair with his mittens like the wizard-figure he’s become in the Democratic Party even though he’s not a Democrat! In other words the Biden Administration is shaping up to be “Weekend at Bernie’s [Commune].” At least Lady Gaga didn’t wear her famous meat dress from the 2010 MTV Music Awards.                  Finally—the Aristotle/Plato debate is solved. “See Plato—this is what happens when you do too much of that socialism s—.”                              What was that again about Trump’s inaugural crowd?         The $15 minimum wage in action.     Headlines of the week:                 Not all heroes wears capes.                          Okay this one is extremely esoteric and only for people who know the secret handshake. . . (But for those who do this is really awesome.)        And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
