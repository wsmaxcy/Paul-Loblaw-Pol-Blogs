L, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert Suggests Ridiculous Way To Tackle Delta COVID-19 Variant, Lee Moran, 2021-07-01, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Wednesday tweeted and then deleted a post mocking the threat of the delta variant of COVID-19. “The easiest way to make the Delta variant go away is to turn off CNN” wrote the QAnon-endorsing Republican touting ignorance as a defense against the mutated strain of the coronavirus first discovered in India that is significantly more transmissible than other variants. “And vote Republican” she added in a further attempt to politicize the issue. Boebert nixed the post after an hour but it remains documented on ProPublica’s “Politwoops” page. In response Colorado state Rep. Steven Woodrow (D) said Boebert “proves once again that stupidity has a champion in Colorado.” Lauren Boebert proves once again that stupidity has a champion in Colorado. https://t.co/yuxdppebx8 Other critics agreed. Many reminded Boebert that parts of her own district are now seeing a surge in the number of cases of the delta variant: Boebert's district has a surge of the delta variant of CoVid unvaccinated people are getting very sick and dying and she tweets this sh*t.  Unbelievably ignorant and irresponsible. Colorado’s @RepBoebert has deleted her tweet on the Delta variant. Boebert represents Mesa County where the Delta variant was first found in Colorado and now makes up 50%+ of its COVID cases. pic.twitter.com/UaIu7EmhAm Bobo doesnt understand how disease spreads and her stupidity will kill more of her constituents who are dying of the Delta variant. Darwin in action! Mesa County he the highest rate of deadly Delta variant infections in Colorado. The CDC has been dispatched to investigate the situation.But don't worry folks Lauren Boebert says she knows the cure for the Delta variant. https://t.co/JJYEGbxbtN #copolitics #copols #coleg #co03 pic.twitter.com/Db7ukmVp3U Colorado’s @RepBoebert has deleted her tweet on the Delta variant.

I guess she doesn’t want people to see how opposed she is to science saving children & the immunocompromised and medical professionals who are mentally & physically exhausted from dealing with this shit. #covid #Delta #GQP #COVIDIOT pic.twitter.com/RGJBQoHGYz Saw that you deleted this before I had the chance to ask you but how exactly does this prevent disease? pic.twitter.com/qFE9smzJza The Flu Klux Klan. LB deleted this insensitive uninformed tweet a few hours ago probably after learning that one of her district’s counties has one of the worst outbreaks of the Delta variant in the country. pic.twitter.com/9HnHVgp3Ks How’s the Delta Variant treating your district again science girl? pic.twitter.com/I6xH5Em2Ri Why did you delete this tweet? Is it because your district has one of the biggest outbreaks of the Delta variant? pic.twitter.com/PpwJd2Cfya A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus
