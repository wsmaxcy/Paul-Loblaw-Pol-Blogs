L, Good News Roundup for Tuesday July 6 2021, arhpdxforGood News, 2021-07-06, Greetings to all you Gnusies Gnubies occasional drop-ins silent regulars and first-timers! Come sit with us to find and share messages of hope and to celebrate all the ways good people are solving problems and triumphing over evil-doers. The task we have set ourselves here in Gnuville is to search out hope no matter how difficult the situation might be. We learned during TFG’s four years of terror that hope can be found even in the darkest times. And with the Biden era off to a roaring start there’s a lot more good news though there are also disappointments and challenges. Which means that our mission of bringing hope to our readers continues.   Don’t forget that the Good News Roundup is a collaborative effort. We warmly encourage you to add your own good news finds in our comment section The Best Comment Section on the Internet™ where sanity reigns Gloomy Guses and Debbie Downers are encouraged to see the light and pie fights are forbidden. Settle in with your favorite morning beverage and get your day going with some good news some “hot” music and some food for thought. It’s another long one today — there were just too many stories that I didn’t want to edit out. This isn’t good news but the big event of the past ten days for me was the “heat dome” that settled on the usually cool green Pacific Northwest on Friday June 25th and didn’t lift until around 9:00 p.m. on Monday June 28th. It’s the only experience I’ve ever had that I can honestly describe as “apocalyptic.”  My husband and I live in a house in Portland that was built in 1908. It has no AC  because we’ve never needed it. Of course we’ve experienced a few days over 90˚ but we tend to stay cooler than most homes in Portland because we live on a bluff where there’s almost always a brisk breeze and there are two very large old trees (an oak and a horse chestnut) overhanging our house and shading it both east and west. And we have a powerful attic fan to lift hot air and vent it out of the house. None of that helped much. The temperature inside our house gradually rose to 88˚. We kept it from getting higher in our living room by improvising a swamp cooler with blue ice and a box fan and kept our pets and ourselves as cool as we could with frequent sprays of cold water drank as much water as we could hold and put ice packs on the back of our necks. But by Monday it was clear that we couldn’t out-think the relentless heat. Going to a cooling center wasn’t possible with a dog a cat and a bird in tow. Fortunately — miraculously actually — a young friend of mine reached out to us on Monday morning and when she found out we had no AC she told us she would be over immediately with a portable AC unit that she didn’t need. I think it quite literally saved our lives. Looking back it’s clear that both my husband and I were experiencing weakness and confusion that had snuck up on us so slowly that we were unaware of it. It was only after a couple of cool days and nights that we began feeling like ourselves and realized how close we’d come to collapse. The first thing we did after we cooled down on Monday was to order a window AC unit for our bedroom expedited delivery. Getting it upstairs took all our strength but working together we were able to install it correctly without snapping at each other which we’re extremely proud of. It works like a champ and we feel as ready as we’ll ever be for another heat wave though we doubt we’ll ever see anything like that insane “heat dome” again. For a silver lining in all this see the first item in the “Politics” section. Meanwhile here’s some appropriate music: From Willamette Week: U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) says the extreme heat and destructive wildfires in the Pacific Northwest are grabbing the attention of his colleagues who are otherwise skeptical that the planet is warming. “I’m not going to tell people ... that we’ve got everybody there and it’s a kumbaya moment” Wyden says. “But when it’s 109 degrees [in Portland] you bet it’s getting senators’ attention.” Wyden discussed the 116-degree heat storm [on a] podcast this week in an interview focused on climate change and what if anything Congress can do to arrest it. Wyden argued that fighting the effects of global warming might become the public works project that could unite an otherwise polarized nation. (He’s introduced a bill for a 21st Century Conservation Corps to fight wildfires across the West.) ✂️   Listen on Spotify. Listen on Apple Podcast.  It’s great news that the Biden administration is moving ahead speedily on this vital consumer protection. From Politico: Biden’s HHS is out with its first of several rules for enforcing a long-awaited ban on “surprise” bills — a complex undertaking that will have far-reaching consequences for health care in the U.S. Over 411 pages of regulations HHS details how federal departments should help keep patients from unknowingly signing away their new protections and how patients should challenge unexpected charges POLITICO’s Rachel Roubein reports. Under the policy which is to take effect Jan. 1 health providers must publicly post rules banning surprise bills on their websites and in notices given to patients. The administration is also creating a complaint review process for patients who think they’ve been surprise-billed anyway. Those protections are the result of years of stops and starts in Congress before lawmakers finally managed to pass a ban on surprise out-of-network bills late last year. Yet even then they left some of the most politically fraught details for the Biden administration to sort out. ✂️ One final fine-print detail: In early June UnitedHealthcare said it would start retroactively denying emergency room claims it later deemed to not be actual emergencies. But the administration sought to head off that practice on Thursday spelling out that it would be disallowed under both the surprise billing ban and the broader Affordable Care Act.  From the New York Times: Alvin Bragg a career prosecutor with experience taking on white-collar crime and corruption is poised to become Manhattan’s next district attorney a job that will include overseeing the most prominent and contentious criminal case in the United States: the prosecution of former President Donald J. Trump’s family business. Given the overwhelming edge Democrats hold in Manhattan Mr. Bragg is heavily favored to win the general election in November after his foremost opponent in the Democratic primary Tali Farhadian Weinstein conceded on Friday. If he wins Mr. Bragg would immediately take over a high-stakes inquiry that on Thursday yielded a 15-count indictment against the Trump Organization the Trump family business and one of its key executives Allen Weisselberg. ✂️  In an interview on Friday Mr. Bragg acknowledged the highly consequential nature of the investigation into Mr. Trump but he said he was equally focused on other important tasks. “We’re also talking about the gun-trafficking issues the scope of the entire system and the collateral consequences” he said. “It’s all a profound responsibility.” Mr. Bragg 47 would be the first Black person to lead an office that still prosecutes more Black people than members of any other racial group. Too little too late as usual. But at least we may be better prepared for the next time because there damn well will be a next time. Fortunately Biden is stepping up to try to assist our inept state leadership. From the Oregonian: Gov. Kate Brown on Sunday said the state has begun a review of its preparation for and response to a heat wave that killed at least 94 residents. During an appearance on CBS News’ “Face The Nation” Brown said state leaders had worked to spread the word open cooling centers and distribute water. “Unfortunately we still lost too many lives” Brown said. “Absolutely unacceptable. Following events like this we always do reviews and see what we can do better next time.” The Oregonian/OregonLive’s review of the state and local response published Sunday morning found that Oregonians struggled to reach agencies that could provide help that the state and local leaders could have done more to explain how deadly the event could be and that state emergency planners don’t have a plan for handling extreme heat. Brown also said she had spoken to President Joe Biden earlier in the week. Biden she said wanted to know how the federal government can assist the Western states in future heat crises ones that are now predicted to occur more frequently. “We need resources and we need boots on the ground” Brown said. “For example we need financial resources to be able to purchase critical essential equipment like aircraft to help us fight fire. We need to make sure that we have adequate boots on the ground.” Brown also voiced concern about the fact that minority communities are affected disproportionately. She compared the heat wave to fires that have previously swept through southern Oregon after which undocumented immigrants who lost their homes weren’t able to access federal aid.  Given the hard feelings between the Dems and the GQP in the Oregon legislature this bipartisan compromise is truly good news. We desperately need more resources and smarter responses to deal with the wildfires that are becoming increasingly routine here. From The Oregonian: After some last-minute jockeying and wordsmithing both backers and advocacy groups who had opposed elements of Oregon’s omnibus wildfire response bill say they are satisfied with the version that lawmakers passed Saturday. Senate Bill 762 which comes with a $185 million price tag contains myriad provisions to up the state’s game when it comes to fighting wildfires preparing communities for them and making forests more resilient to fire. It comes after the state’s devastating Labor Day fires last year and as it enters what many experts believe will be another challenging fire season this year. The bill garnered bipartisan support after lawmakers agreed to sidestep the biggest sticking point over lands subject to property restrictions intended to slow the spread of wildfire. Lawmakers removed a key definition from the bill so that it could be outlined with more input later assuaging some Republicans. Sen. Jeff Golden D-Ashland the chief sponsor of the bill said he was looking to hold the line on any amendments that would water down the bill and was fine with the outcome. “When it became clear that we needed to have one more amendment to get a real bipartisan vote the only thing I wanted was to make sure that no category of land would be categorically excluded from regulation” he said. “I got that.” This settlement comes to about $14000 for each victim. I wish they were getting more but getting this much plus the vaildation that comes with it is a good step toward closure. From Reuters: The Boy Scouts of America has reached an $850 million settlement with groups representing tens of thousands of men with sexual abuse claims a major step toward addressing a deluge of accusations that sent the organization into bankruptcy. In a filing on Thursday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware the Boy Scouts (BSA) said the settlement with the Coalition of Abused Scouts for Justice and two other groups covers claims by about 60000 abuse survivors. It said the accord provides a framework for a global resolution of abuse claims and could allow it to emerge from Chapter 11 protection "late this year." "Bringing these groups together marks a significant milestone ... as the BSA works toward our dual imperatives of equitably compensating survivors of abuse and preserving the mission of scouting" the 111-year-old nonprofit said in a statement. The groups separately called the accord a "significant accomplishment that achieves consensus" among most claimants the Boy Scouts and more than 250 local councils. Thursday's settlement requires a judge's approval and could face opposition from insurers that would be on the hook for payouts. ✂️  The bankruptcy filing covered the national organization not the local councils.  Local print news is vital for keeping people informed about local issues especially in places like these four rural North Carolina counties where “only 18 percent of households are using the internet at the FCC’s stated basic broadband speed.” So this new initiative is a rare piece of good news for local journalism. From Columbia Journalism Review: Les High—publisher of The News Reporter in Whiteville North Carolina—has been concerned about the state of local journalism in his part of the state. “You look at high-poverty rural areas like ours” on the state’s Southeast border “and newspapers just don’t have the capacity to do the type of investigative and in-depth reporting that we need to do and people deserve” High said. To address the gap in enterprise coverage and support the local newspapers that remain in his four-county region High founded the Border Belt Reporting Center an investigative nonprofit. The center aims to finance hyper-local investigations and in-depth reporting and provide it to local outlets for free. Stories will also run on the nonprofit’s website. “We’ve drawn a very clear line” High says. “We’re not competitors; we’re partners.” The four counties covered are not quite news deserts: Bladen County has one newspaper as does Scotland county; Columbus County has two. Robeson County has one local newspaper in addition to The Pine Needle the student newspaper at the University of North Carolina Pembroke. To High’s mind it’s critical that the county’s newspapers succeed and he wants the Border Belt Reporting Center to be part of that success. ✂️  The Border Belt Reporting Center’s model is built for a particular community with its specific needs but High and his team hope that if they’re successful communities with similar challenges might be able to replicate their model. In a world where a significant portion of nonprofit funding goes to communities where wealth is already concentrated the Border Belt Reporting Center has gathered support to supplement pre-existing reporting in four high-poverty rural communities. Not only do they hope to provide local community members with more accountability reporting; they want to keep local papers alive because they know that access to local print newspapers is especially valuable in low-income communities.  Our favorite political couple has hit the milestone of 75 years together. The Washington Post has a wonderful story about their marriage which I wish I could embed in full. If you can get past the paywall do read it. On Wednesday the Carters will be married 75 years the longest in presidential history. Jimmy 96 and Rosalynn 93 will mark the occasion in the town where they met nearly a century ago. “They will probably just sit and hold hands” said a friend and neighbor Jill Stuckey. Three days later family friends and Carter administration officials will travel to Plains for an anniversary party in the local high school auditorium. ✂️  Eleanor Rosalynn Smith and James Earl Carter Jr. have known each other virtually since birth. Their love story blossomed in World War II and survived the searing scrutiny of political life. Two years ago the length of their marriage surpassed that of George H.W. and Barbara Bush. Jimmy is also the longest-living president in history. The Carters’ union has evolved with the times starting as a traditional “father-knows-best” marriage in the 1940s and ’50s and eventually becoming a full partnership. Born in the Deep South in 1924 Jimmy became a champion of gender equality. He appointed record numbers of women to the federal bench including Ruth Bader Ginsburg who went on to serve on the Supreme Court. Rosalynn born in 1927 was at first a stay-at-home mom but she gradually took a leading role in the family business and politics. By the 1960s and ’70s when many women were demanding equality she had become a pioneering voice in the State Capitol and the White House. “Over the years we became not only friends and lovers but partners” Rosalynn said at Jimmy’s 90th birthday celebration. “He has always thought I could do anything and because of that I/we have had some wonderful adventures and challenges.”  I find the idea of resting comfortably in a spiffy train compartment with a private bathroom while the train carries me from one European city to the next incredibly appealing. No doubt too pricey though... From Positive News: With travel restrictions set to be eased across Europe from 1 July the continent is preparing to welcome visitors back. But travellers’ aspirations appear to have shifted during the pandemic amid growing concern about the climate crisis. ✂️ Pushed towards extinction by budget airlines Europe’s forgotten sleeper services are being revived as travellers seek sustainable transport options and revel in taking it slowly. Nightjet the Austrian rail operator and Snälltåget from Sweden are among those relaunching overnight services between EU cities. Startups are also sensing opportunity. European Sleeper an upstart railway company raised €500000 (£430000) in seed capital in May to launch a sleeper service between Brussels and Prague. That service calling at Amsterdam and Berlin is scheduled to commence in April 2022. Then there’s French startup Midnight Trains which last week announced that it was rebooting the sleeper train concept entirely with a fleet of rolling hotels. The firm’s carriages will feature plush private bedrooms bathrooms dining cars and even cocktail bars.  Good news for education and intellectual freedom worldwide. From Internet Archive: ...the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) [has] voiced its strong support for the longstanding and widespread library practice of Controlled Digital Lending (CDL). In doing so they join a host of libraries and library associations in asserting the right of libraries to own digitize and lend materials online. IFLA is the leading international body representing the interests of library and information services and their users. It is the global voice of the library and information profession. The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need to be able to provide digital access to library collections and CDL provides an effective lawful tool for doing so. IFLA writes that CDL helps “to fulfill the mission of libraries to support research education and cultural participation within the limits of existing copyright laws.”IFLA’s Statement on Controlled Digital Lending which was approved by IFLA’s Governing Board in May 2021 builds on the U.S.-oriented Position Statement on Controlled Digital Lending which has been endorsed by 55 institutions and 120 individual copyright experts and librarians bringing the discussion into the international context. IFLA’s Statement makes a powerful economic and legal case for supporting CDL in all countries around the world.  This start on cleaning up corruption in the Vatican’s financial doings is long overdue. A Vatican judge has ordered 10 people including an Italian cardinal to stand trial for alleged financial crimes including embezzlement money laundering fraud extortion and abuse of office. Those indicted include Cardinal Angelo Becciu who was fired by the pope last year the former heads of the Vatican’s financial intelligence unit and two Italian brokers involved in the Vatican’s purchase of a building in a luxury area of London. Becciu whom the pope fired last year and who has maintained his innocence during a two-year investigation became the highest ranking Vatican-based church official to be indicted for alleged financial crimes. In accordance with church law the pope personally approved the judge’s decision to investigate and indict Becciu. The charges against him include embezzlement and abuse of office. ✂️  The trial is due to start on 27 July in the Vatican a statement said. This is one of those “indistinguishable from magic” scientific developments. From SwissInfo: A Swiss company is offering hope to the more than 11 million people worldwide who suffer serious burns every year. The company is launching a revolutionary machine capable of generating skin that can be grafted in large quantities using a sample provided by the patient. “It’s not artificial skin but it’s not exactly natural skin either” said Daniela Marino cofounder and director of CUTISS launched in 2017 at the University Children’s Hospital Zurich. “To be precise it’s a skin-tissue equivalent produced by bio-engineering.” Using a small sample of healthy skin from a burns patient cutaneous (skin) cells are “grown” in a laboratory and then combined with a hydrogel to produce new skin. The result denovoSkin is one millimetre thick the same as the average natural dermis and epidermis. The big advantage over traditional techniques is that a sample the size of a stamp can end up as a piece of skin almost the size of a place mat.  This wonderful news items has been mentioned here before but this is a slightly deeper dive. From Good News Network: From Everglades to Okefenokee Florida legislatures just created one of the biggest wildlife corridors in the developed world with a $400 million funding seed. The Florida Wildlife Corridor Act signed into law by Gov. DeSantis ensures that animals can travel—without seeing a car or a human from the Everglades Estuary to the borders with Georgia and Alabama—while protecting existing and new conservation areas securing natural resources and more. Between the beach-bustle of Miami Daytona Fort Lauderdale and elsewhere and the lazy waters of the Gulf of Mexico on the western coast lies a mosaic of swamps pastures rivers farmland and forest. Among these varied ecosystems 700 imperiled species live in habitat that may be owned privately as state recreation areas and as federally-protected wilderness. The total bipartisan support the bill received typical of American conservation legislation has seen $300 million secured to protect these varied ecosystems as well as to buy new conservation areas or to secure conservation easements—a subsidized incentive to conserve a particular feature on private acreage. Another $100 million was earmarked for the general conservation program called Florida Forever the largest state-controlled pubic land acquisition program of its kind in the U.S.  The first of two international stories celebrating the creation of new protected areas. From Good News Network: Norway is dismantling their last Arctic coal mine piece by piece and turning the area it sits in into a national park twice the size of Grand Teton in Wyoming. The goal is to turn the Svalbard Archipelago in particular the Van Mijenfjord into a howling wilderness once again—the best managed wilderness in the world where polar bears seals and countless other Arctic species can thrive in what experts say will be one of the most resilient areas under threat from climate change. Seeds aren’t the only thing famously stored underground on Svalbard. Coal has been mined there under state monopoly for 100 years. Despite climate change pressures mounting throughout the 21st century it wasn’t until 2016 that a government white paper announced a moratorium. Seven national parks 15 bird sanctuaries one geopark and six reserves dot two-thirds of the 23500 square mile (61000 square km) archipelago of islands fjords mountains and glaciers. 3000 polar bears inhabit the area and during the late summer more than 20 million birds of 80 different species nest on Svalbard. ✂️  “Our goal is for Svalbard to be one of the best-managed wilderness areas in the world. That requires us to implement measures to deal with climate changes and pressure caused by increased traffic. The protection of the Van Mijen fjord and surrounding area is a direct response to this” says minister Sveinung Rotevatn...  From AP: After decades of being exploited by loggers a vast cross-border area of breathtaking beauty in the Balkans centered on Shar Mountain is close to becoming a national park one of the largest in Europe. North Macedonian lawmakers are expected to shortly pass a bill granting Shar Mountain that status. The area of over 240000 hectares (593053 acres) that ranges through Albania North Macedonia and Kosovo is a treasure of natural beauty and diverse and unique wildlife. Shar Mountain has 37 glacial lakes 25 of them in North Macedonia and the rest in Kosovo which glint in the mountain’s folds like a myriad of gray-green eyes scanning the skies. Especially impressive is the region’s biodiversity which counts 200 endemic plant species 167 species of butterflies 12 of amphibians 18 of reptiles 130 of birds and 45 of mammals. That is almost half of the total number of mammal species in North Macedonia.  There’s still so much to discover about our amazing planet! From Good News Network: So-called ‘fairy lanterns’ are among the most extraordinary-looking of all flowering plants. These curious leafless plants (genus Thismia) grow in the darkest depths of remote rainforests where they are seldom seen. There are some 90 species worldwide distributed across the forests of Asia Australasia South America and the USA. They all lack true leaves and chlorophyll obtaining their food from root-associated fungi shared with other green plants. ✂️  Scientists at Oxford and in Malaysia have just described a species of fairy lantern completely new to science. It was first discovered by rainforest explorer Dome Nikong in 2019 who astonishingly found the plant growing along a popular tourist track on Gunung Sarut a mountain located in the Hulu Nerus Forest Reserve in the state of Terengganu. ✂️  The plant’s unique and remarkable ‘mitre’ color and surface texture make Thismia sitimeriamiae among the most eye-catching plants ever described from Peninsular Malaysia.  A stunning reminder of what we’re fighting for when we fight to save our environment. Brought to you by Rosy Nora and Rascal.  Rosy a rescue herself picked this sweet story. From Good News Network: Since 1994 Zhi Xiang has rescued over 8000 homeless pooches from the streets of the Chinese mega-city caring for all of them.  ✂️ With help from volunteers and his own Bao’en Temple workforce Xiang currently cares for hundreds of cats and dogs. Costing nearly $2.5 million every year in labor and supplies Xiang tries to get as many of them as he can into family homes overseas using social media to reach out to perspective pet owners. So far 300 dogs have been adopted by families in Canada the United States and Germany.  Nora chose this story because she wishes she could chase one of these mice. From The Guardian:  Scientists have discovered that an extinct native mouse thought to have been wiped out more than 150 years ago is thriving on islands off Western Australia. Researchers compared DNA samples from eight extinct native rodents and 42 of their living relatives to study the decline of native species since the arrival of Europeans in Australia. The results showed the “extinct” Gould’s mouse was indistinguishable from the Shark Bay mouse which is found on several small islands off the coast of WA. “The resurrection of this species brings good news in the face of the disproportionally high rate of native rodent extinction” Australian National University evolutionary biologist Emily Roycroft said.  Rascal is grateful that he doesn’t have to migrate but he’s certain that he’d ace it if he ever tried. From Good News Network: Within the European robin’s eye scientists have identified a protein which they believe acts as the bird’s biological attunement to Earth’s magnetic field the key to the long-sought mechanism behind how they are able to migrate mass distances. ✂️ ‘Cryptochromes’ are ... a group of light-sensitive flavoproteins found in the retinas of birds and other groups of animals. Cryptochrome 4 (cry4) is posited in a new study to be the organ behind magneto-sensitivity. Following an experiment using quantum mechanics The Scientist reports that researchers at the University of Oxford searching for such a means were left with “overwhelming evidence that cry4 [is] the hottest candidate.” One of the reasons for this was that of the three other cryptochromes in the robin’s eye cry4 was the only one that bound to a particular molecule which gave it the ability to sense light an important first step in the ability to sense magnetic fields. Furthermore unlike the other three which had 24-hour responsiveness cry4 was not attuned to the day-night cycle but instead had seasonal variation which in turn the other three did not possess. The cryptochrome proteins in chickens and pigeons birds which don’t migrate could not detect the magnetic field generated in the laboratory further reinforcing the theory.  This portrait of a smiling balloon fish won photographer Daryl Duda an award in this year’s Ocean Conservancy photo contest in the “Up Close and Personal” category:  Here’s a new category for my roundups inspired by my wanting to share this lovely story with you about the connection between the great saxophonist Paul Desmond and the most enchanting human being ever to appear in films Audrey Hepburn. In the February 8 2021 New Yorker writer/cartoonist Paul Rogers recounted it in a full-page 10-panel illustration. I can’t embed the wonderful drawings so please click the link to see them. In the spring of 1954 Hepburn was starring in “Ondine” at the 46th Street Theatre. The Brubeck Quartet was playing at Basin Street a night club a few blocks away. Every night Paul asked Brubeck to call an intermission at the same time. Desmond would duck out of the club and cut across Times Square. He’d stand in an alley to watch Hepburn walk out the stage door and climb into her limo. That year Paul wrote a song called “Audrey” which appeared on the Columbia Records album “Brubeck Time.” Desmond died from lung cancer in 1977. He was single and never knew whether Hepburn had heard the song he wrote for her.  When Hepburn died in 1993 her ex-husband Andrea Dotti called Brubeck to ask if his quartet would play “Audrey” at a memorial service at the United Nations headquarters. This took Brubeck by surprise. “I had no idea you’d be aware of ‘Audrey’...”  “My wife listened to that song every night before she went to bed.” Here’s that song. www.theatlantic.com/… The Pandemic Did Not Affect Mental Health the Way You Think. The authors all academic psychologists write: “We were surprised by how well many people weathered the pandemic’s psychological challenges.
