DKos Asheville sharing local since 2011 Concerns of racial equity are increasingly shaping how Buncombe County employees do their work. But a new proposal up for consideration by the Board of Commissioners on Tuesday May 4 would also bring an equity lens to when county workers go off the clock. As outlined in a presentation by Sharon Burke Buncombe’s human resources director county leaders are requesting that Juneteenth be added as a paid holiday. Observed on June 19 or the immediately preceding Friday the holiday commemorates the 1865 announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation by Union soldiers to enslaved people in Texas and “signifies freedom and liberation for African Americans in the United States.” The proposed ordinance establishing the holiday states that the move is supported by the county’s Equity and Inclusion Workgroup and would “represent an authentic and more inclusive history of freedom in America.” However Burke’s presentation also notes that recognizing Juneteenth “shows a complicated American history and may be considered divisive.” If approved Buncombe government workers would receive a total of 13 paid holidays per year a number in line with other large North Carolina county and city governments. Essential county functions such as emergency medical services and public safety would continue to operate that day and employees required to work would bank the holiday time for later use.

Wildlife Resources Commission biologist Justin McVey: a Subaru a dog an appreciation for craft beer and a bear-resistant trash can.  For many Asheville residents seeing a bear at their trash can is a bucket-list item the pinnacle of mountain living. But as exciting as a bear sighting can be interactions with the furry four-legged natives can quickly spell problems for bears and humans alike.  In November Asheville City Council authorized the city’s sanitation division to provide bear-resistant trash cans for a $10 monthly fee on a first-come first-served basis. An initial order of 340 cans (which the city calls “carts”) totaling $81052.50 was placed shortly thereafter; the carts arrived and went out to 310 residents in early February.  So far the city has only heard about one instance of a bear getting into a bear-resistant cart says Jes Foster Asheville’s solid waste manager. But that doesn’t mean the bears are going away — if anything their appetite may be growing.  2020 was a crazy year for everyone — bears included says McVey. The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission received 421 nuisance calls about bears from Buncombe County residents in 2020 McVey says. That was a jump from the year before which saw 289 calls he notes.  In past years calls to both McVey and the NCWRC’s Human Wildlife Interaction helpline generally followed similar themes: Residents would report bears in their yards getting into trash cans or eating from bird feeders. While many of the incoming calls still follow the same pattern McVey says some bear activity is different from what was observed in years prior.  Posted on April 28 2021 by Xpress Contributor  By Tom Fiedler Asheville Watchdog Five years ago entrepreneur and philanthropist Mack Pearsall thought he had discovered Asheville’s path to great wealth and world acclaim. Not through its beer; not because of its natural amenities. Rather in this time of global climate concern the 84-year-old descendant of a pioneering North Carolina family believed Asheville could prosper by monetizing a unique yet little-known asset: Its federal archive of climate and weather data — the largest such collection among all the nations on Earth — curated by a local talent bank that includes several Nobel laureates and scores of climate scientists. Pearsall joined the call to rebrand Asheville as “Climate City” and he invested more than $2.5 million to catalyze this dream. Forbes magazine said it wasn’t “far-fetched to think of this small city nestled in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina as an emerging Silicon Valley.” But so far? Mostly crickets. Asheville’s scientific talent Pearsall says his North Carolina drawl tinged with disappointment “doesn’t want to be unleashed.” Although the self-described “impatient futurist” harbors his doubts many others remain optimistic that the day is coming when the city will be known as much for its intellectual capital as it is today for beer and bears though perhaps not as quickly as initially hoped. Nobody questions the potential value of the data just waiting to be digitally mined and sold in a marketplace increasingly aware of the connection between sustainable life and changing climate. Accessible through computers run by some 500 federal state and university scientists in Asheville’s downtown Veach-Baley Federal Complex are answers to questions both trivial and vast beyond imagination.
