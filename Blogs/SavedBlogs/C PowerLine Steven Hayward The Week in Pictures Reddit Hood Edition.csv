C, The Week in Pictures: Reddit Hood Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-01-30, This is the week that Reddit became a greater menace to the modern world than Donald Trump’s defunct Twitter feed. Or at least that’s what the major media trying to hold on to their three readers would have you think. Hasn’t President Biden come up with an executive order that will make everyone come out even and deliver cute free puppies while we’re at it? If only GameStop made solar panels. Oh and we’re not quite done with Bernie memes yet.                                             Headlines of the week:                                                    And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
