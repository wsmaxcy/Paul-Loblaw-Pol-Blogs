L, CRYBABY TRUMP Files Asinine Lawsuit Against Twitter Facebook Google / UPDATE: All About the Grift, News Corpse, 2021-07-07, Last week Trump's spokes shill tweeted that Trump would "make a huge announcement" on Wednesday July 7 2021. That day has come and the announcement is living down to the expectations that most people have for the one-term twice-impeached former reality TV game show host who is indisputably America's biggest loser. From his Bedminster New Jersey golf resort Trump delivered a nearly hour long address to reveal his intention to file a lawsuit against "Big Tech" companies Twitter Facebook and Google. Make no mistake this alleged litigation (there is no evidence yet that it's been filed) is driven purely by Trump's voracious ego and thirst for revenge. After having his accounts on social media suspended for blatant violations of their terms of service Trump is proposing to exploit the courts to punish the private companies who took responsible actions to stem his inflammatory rhetoric. He already incited a deadly insurrection in Washington D.C. on January 6th and he is continuing his bellicose "Big Lie" rants that drove his glassy-eyed disciples to riot and storm the Capitol. Trump's tedious dissertation on his pending lawsuit was filled with bizarre and legally preposterous assertions. He starts off describing this suit as the beginning of a much bigger initiative. "We will take this battle" he promises "to state legislatures to Congress and to the ballot box." But the whole premise of the action is ludicrous. Trump thinks that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (which protects free speech) makes social media liable as "government actors" and subject to First Amendment prohibitions against censorship: Not only is Trump's interpretation of Section 230 completely off he is articulating a paranoid crackpot conspiracy theory that social media companies are in cahoots with the feds to silence him. Like his unhinged raving about election fraud there is no evidence of these allegations either. But that doesn't stop him from spouting off incoherently (video below) Some excerpts follow: Trump didn't cite a single legal principle to support his claims. That's because he can't. The Constitution's First Amendment prohibits government censorship. Hence the wording that "Congress shall make no law [...] abridging the freedom of speech or of the press." Trump actually undermines his case by bragging about all the avenues of speech he has available to him that he insists are successful (they aren't). Trump always has a "sir" story wherein some beleaguered soul begs him to do something that really only benefits Trump. And his reliance on the notoriously disreputable Rasmussen for polling data doesn't advance his legal interests. Even reputable polls are not legal arguments. Cases are decided by statute and precedent not popularity. This is more conspiracy mongering that now includes a cabal comprised of the government tech companies the media and Democrats. If you ask him Trump would probably add academia banking the judiciary liberal churches and the Girl Scouts of America. Following his prepared TelePrompTer remarks Trump took questions from what was obviously an exclusive club of ultra-conservative media. Every question was framed positively for Trump or prefaced with adoring commentary. That's just more proof that Trump can't be taken seriously that he cares about a free press. Which you recall he has repeatedly maligned in Stalinist terms as "the enemy of the People." It's impossible to set aside Trump's flaming hypocrisy in all of this. After all he's the first one to "cancel" anyone who dares to contradict him. He is the undisputed King of Cancel Culture. He has called for dozens of boycotts of American companies. He even expressed his regret that he didn't ban Facebook and Twitter when he mistakenly thought he could have as president. And now his buddy Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is pushing a state law that would make it illegal for private companies to monitor their own website comments. It's from that perch of police state prohibition that Trump is heralding his campaign for free speech. So not only is Trump on swampy ground legally he's up to both of his chins in hypocrisy. This lawsuit if it is ever actually filed is going nowhere in hurry. However let's hope that this suit isn't dismissed before the defendants can conduct discovery. There is a wealth of information that can be acquired regarding Trump's activities prior to and during the insurrection his relationships with right-wing media (Fox News Newsmax OAN etc.) and efforts to unlawfully damage the commercial interests of private companies against whom he holds grudges. That should be fun. UPDATE: It's All About the Grift! David Corn of Mother Jones spells out the latest con. NOTE: Twitter suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
