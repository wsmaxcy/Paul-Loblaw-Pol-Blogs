L, Rudy & Trump allies pressured election officials to overturn Maricopa County's election results, Lefty Coaster, 2021-07-03, Well an attempt at election tampering in Maricopa County has come to light. But the election tampering was coming from and being directed by the Trump White House. What a shock!  BY CAROLINE VAKIL Former President Trump Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward and Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tried to contact Maricopa County supervisors weeks after the 2020 election in an effort to get the county to change its election results the Arizona Republic reported Friday. The news outlet obtained voicemails and text messages from allies of the former president inquiring about how the county was going to address alleged irregularities in the vote count. Some of the concerns by Trump’s allies related to the voting software and Trump’s performance in the election. So Georgia wasn’t the only state Mr. Trump and his sleazy crew pressured local officials to tamper with the results of the 2020 presidential election.  In one text that Ward sent supervisor Clint Hickman on Nov. 13 she asked him to “at least get an independent computer expert” to see if the county had any issues with its ballot count according to the Republic.  At the time Hickman was the chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors which would have given him the ability to certify or delay the 2020 election results among other things. “Not someone who already works there” she reportedly wrote. “These ballots can be counted manually assuming nobody deleted the folder holding the ambiguous ballot scans. If the folder was deleted federal data forensics teams could theoretically undelete it and perhaps track down the person who deleted it. What if election fraud was as easy as dragging votes from one folder to another?”    Kelli Ward called the report “BS”  By Rachel Janfaza Along with Trump Giuliani -- who in November met with GOP state lawmakers in Arizona -- also tried to contact supervisors in Maricopa County according to the Republic and to Republican Bill Gates who confirmed the Christmas Eve call to CNN's Kyung Lah in June. "I have a few things I'd like to talk over with you. Maybe we can get this thing fixed up. You know I really think it's a shame that Republicans sort of we're both in this kind of situation. And I think there may be a nice way to resolve this for everybody" Giuliani said in a voice mail to Gates published by the Republic on Friday and also previously obtained by CNN.
