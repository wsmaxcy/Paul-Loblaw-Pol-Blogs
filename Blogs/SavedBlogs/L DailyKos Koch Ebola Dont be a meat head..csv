L, Don't be a meat head., Koch Ebola, 2021-04-28, In 2017 I got a heart attack. My doctor me straight up: If you don’t quite smoking you are going to die! Period! He also told me to lower my consumption of red meat. All my arteries were clogged.  So why am I talking about this? The Conservative culture war is still raging on. Is red meat part of the conservative culture? Or are they just protecting the meat industry?  President Biden is suggesting what I have been doing for 3 years now. I starting out avoiding red meat by just having it once a month. I weened my way off of red meat.  I substituted meat by having fake meat like soy bacon. Hey! I quit smoking after 39 years. Now I don’t tell anybody what to do with their body but if you avoid red meat not only you will save our planet but you will save you own life. At least think about it. thank you for listening.  Is rock and roll dead?   Click the link and find out.
