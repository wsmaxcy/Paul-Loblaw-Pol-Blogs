L, This odd ad algorithm wants progressives reading RawStory to buy a $629 Trump gold coin., HalBrown, 2021-07-06, The article which featured the ad above: RawStory generally aggregates articles from other news and opinion sources but sometimes publishes original articles. Media Bias Factcheck accurately describes it as having a strong liberal bias.  I look at the website for breaking news and some original stories sometimes once every hour. The website has staff who find news items of interest to a progressive readership published elsewhere with summaries which are especially helpful when the article originally was published on a subscription website. What I find weird about RawStory is how there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason as to what ads are placed on their stories. With a progressive readership and hardly any pro-Trump trolls among those who make comments I don’t understand why a Money Metals ad for an expensive Trump coin would generate the valuable clicks which turn into revenue for RawStory. All I can think of by way of an explanation why an ad like this was on RawStory is  that they are employing a really “stupid” algorithm which searches story text for keywords in this case Trump and automatically places ads in those stories related to the keyword.  I didn’t click on the ad directly but I did look at the Money Metal website here. This is a company which among other precious metals sells a 5 oz. Rhodium Bar for $97325.00.  They don’t even feature the Trump coins on their main page. You have to search their site for Trump to find the coins. This is what their website says about their Trump gold coin: First released in 2019 the President Trump Gold Rounds honor the achievements of the 45th President of the United States. While this President's history is still being written for the legions of Donald Trump supporters these rounds couldn’t have been released soon enough. The profile of President Trump is featured on the obverse of the round. The obverse also includes the inscription ‘Donald J Trump’ along the top as well the words ‘45th President’ right underneath his chin. The reverse features the famous columns of the White House along with the weight and purity (1 oz 999 AG) at the bottom. These rounds come fresh from the mint so it’s easy to get your hands on pristine quality bullion rounds while paying homage to the 45th president. As far as I can tell Money Metals from a search on their website while you can find the Trump coins (below or enlarge image from my own blog )… … they don’t seem to have have a President Obama or a President Biden gold coin. If Money Metals is only selling Trump gold coins the only reason I can come up with is that he’s the only president in modern history perhaps in all of American history to have a cult following with enough members affluent enough to pay over $600 for a coin with his likeness. I wonder if Trump gets a cut of the profits from these sales. I wouldn’t be surprised if he does. See my comment below about Kos also having an odd ad placement.
