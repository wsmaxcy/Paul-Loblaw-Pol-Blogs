L, Today's amok run is located in San Diego, ca cokz, 2021-04-23, www.rawstory.com/â€¦ gngngng. Comically funny headline. Rawstory is doing this all the time and I think it certainly depicts a certain paradoxon. The absence of law and the presence of a quagmire. Chesspool of ideology. Or uncontrolled behaviour. (the headline has been changed in words but not in meaning to avoid copyright issues)  "A shooting left one person dead and as many as four others wounded Thursday night in the Gaslamp Quarter authorities said. Officers detained one person and reportedly recovered a firearm and the scene was not thought to be active as of 11 p.m. San Diego police Officer John Buttle said The gunfire erupted around 10:30 p.m. at Fifth Avenue and J Street and possibly "a few other locations" along Fifth Avenue according to Buttle who said officers and investigators were still sorting out what happened" The San Diego Union-Tribune reports.
