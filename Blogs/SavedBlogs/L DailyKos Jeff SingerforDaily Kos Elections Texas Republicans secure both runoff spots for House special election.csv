L, Texas Republicans secure both runoff spots for House special election, Jeff SingerforDaily Kos Elections, 2021-05-02, The all-party primary to succeed the late Rep. Ron Wright in Texas’ 6th Congressional District took place Saturday and his fellow Republicans secured both spots in the upcoming runoff. The congressman’s widow party activist Susan Wright led with 19% while state Rep. Jake Ellzey edged out 2018 Democratic nominee Jana Lynne Sanchez 14-13 a margin of 354 votes. The Associated Press did not call the race for second place on election night but Sanchez conceded on Sunday morning.  This seat which covers much of the city of Arlington supported Donald Trump just 51-48 four years after it backed him 54-42 but Republicans have continued to be the dominant party down the ballot. That held true on Saturday as the 11 Republicans on the ballot took in a combined 62% of the vote while the 10 Democrats clocked in at just 37%. The runoff which has not yet been scheduled will be the second bout between Ellzey and the Wright family: Ron Wright defeated him 52-48 in the 2018 nomination battle to succeed longtime Rep. Joe Barton which was a surprisingly close victory for the heavily-favored future congressman. Ellzey looks like the underdog again though as Susan Wright has the backing of Donald Trump and the anti-tax Club for Growth.
