L, The Holocaust "Swamp Creature.", Telly Caneesis, 2021-06-29, There is a person in the current 117th Congress who has been removed from serving on any Committees. She is a believer in the conspiracy theories of a group known as QAnon. She wanted to be allowed to carry a handgun into the Chamber and Heaven help us equated in the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic the need for her to wear a mask to being subjected to a Holocaust; the German genocide that killed at least six million people during the Second World War. (She clearly has no understanding of the methods of transmission of the virus; she wanted to be her own super-spreader). We need to show exactly who and what she is. And she is the one who mocked Parkland survivor David Hogg in an unearthed video: She called him an 'idiot' who's trained 'like a dog’ ….  She is projecting her own failures as a human being onto others. She has also been able to persuade many people to help her raise millions of dollars for her re-election fund. To describe many of those who are donating for perspective let’s look at the presidential election race not today’s but w-a-a-a-y back in 1952 almost 70 years ago. Of the many contenders for that race one of the preferred candidates was the Senator for Tennessee Estes Kefauver. His was a very positive personality. He was widely admired; had the reputation of being “interested” in everyone and knowing the names of everyone he met. He was a very strong contender for the role until one (almost) chance remark that killed his campaign. As a background if someone sticks a pin into your rear your immediate tendency is to respond by yelling “Ouch” and/or spinning around and poking the “sticker” in the eye or breaking his nose. On the other hand if one has the sort of analytical mind that wonders “Now why would that person do such a thing and why now?” it might be possible to turn an adversary into a friend and supporter. Back to the well-liked and -admired senator: After delivering his stump speech a lady in the audience went to a microphone and commented “Oh Mr. Kefauver if only all the intelligent people in the country would vote for you you would be our next President.” If he had hesitated for just a moment and thought of saying “Madam all those who vote for me will be demonstrating superior intelligence!” he might indeed have become President. Instead his “Ouch” remark was “Madam there aren’t enough of them!” (;-)) Unfortunately Senator Kefauver was absolutely on the mark and most of their descendants have now been through 30+ years of brainwashing by Fox News and fellow-travelers conned into voting for those so-called Republicans (“SCRs”) who are not prepared to honor their oaths to protect the Constitution. Not only that but these SCRs are projecting their own agenda. They talk about “Stopping the Steal” but they project their own behavior onto others since they are working assiduously to STEAL the 2022 and 2024 elections. Back to the Holocaust person: It is so tempting to use the easy epithets: “A*****e” and “B***h" but that is too facile. There is a complete thesaurus of terms we can apply here with greater satisfaction (and the subject probably won’t even understand anything more complex than “bad”). So here is a modest abbreviated alphabetic contribution: She is an Arrogant Bauble mentally Constipated Dangerous Ersatz verbally Flatulent (goes with “C” above). I could continue but you get the idea; give me half a chance and I’ll tell you what I REALLY think of this person. In truth she has absolutely NO idea what she is talking about; Nazi Germany imprisoned tortured shot and gassed over six million Jews among others like gays Romanies and cripples. America has suffered a TRUE Holocaust by losing over SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND Americans to Covid-19 in just over ONE YEAR due to the incompetence of a person who was Heaven help us “elected” to the highest office in the land. If he had taken his responsibility seriously he could have acted to save probably 500000 of this huge devastation of American society. With minor variations attributable to Edmond Burke to George Santayana or to Winston Churchill there is the statement “Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.” Anyone heard or perhaps not heard of “Kristallnacht’? Kristallnacht the Night of Broken Glass (from Wikipedia) “was a pogrom against Jews carried out by the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung (SA) paramilitary forces along with civilians throughout Nazi Germany on 9–10 November 1938. The German authorities looked on without intervening.[3] The name Kristallnacht ("Crystal Night") comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of Jewish-owned stores buildings and synagogues were smashed.” Grandparents of someone I know living in Vienna at the time saw what happened that fateful night. The following morning they left Austria and went via Antwerp to America AND SURVIVED. In light of this knowledge when we saw the insurrection on January 6 2021 we reached for our passports although after the way our disgraced ex-president worked to break down decent behavior in the world we would really not know what country would be preferable. Back to the “Holocaust” person she really BELIEVES that the “indignity” of wearing a mask in the midst of a global pandemic is equivalent to America’s January 6 “Kristallnacht” (in which people died) and the 600000+ “Holocaust” deaths of Americans since March 2020 due to Covid-19? Some words to add to the earlier Thesaurus. “Really really Stupid” comes to mind.  The representative from QAnon has an “Ugly” soul and the outside is not that attractive either. Maybe this is behind her behavior — otherwise no-one would take any notice of her. *(This diary has been edited by me in response to valid points raised by commentators. I apologize for unconsciously hurtful remarks and undertake not to use certain terms again since readers come from many backgrounds. BTW is “Bauble” offensive?).
