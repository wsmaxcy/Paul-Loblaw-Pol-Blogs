L,   Polygraphs Busted Right Wing Terrorist Trying To Infiltrate FBI, David Neiwert, 2021-03-21, Ethan Collins had it all figured out. Like a lot of far-right extremists he fantasized a lot about committing various acts of terrorism—bringing down the power grid bombing police stations that sort of thing—and thought about ways to make them happen. The Colorado man decided his best shot was to try to infiltrate a federal law enforcement agency and pull off his crimes from within its ranks. Fortunately Collins is a terrible liar. In order to join that unnamed federal agency he had to take a polygraph test. He failed it. Three times. And his answers to agents the third time around became grounds for a search warrant that produced a store of illegal silencers Collins says he made himself. He’s now under arrest. Collins’ story was revealed this week in a Daily Beast article by Pilar Melendez and Seamus Hughes. He is currently being transported to Colorado to face multiple weapons charges—all of them related to the silencers. Investigators reportedly also found a substantial cache of legal weapons in his home including a high-powered sniper-type rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. According to the affidavit filed by the FBI this week Collins—who makes his living as a pilot—had applied to the federal agency in May 2020 for work and was required to take a polygraph exam. Collins failed three times—likely because of his reactions during the portion of questions devoted to terrorism because after the third blown exam on Jan. 11 the polygraph examiner questioned him further about his responses to those portions of the exam. His answers were hair-raising. Among the many things the Collins confessed: “Collins considers himself as a patriot not a terrorist but at one point during the interview did state he felt he was a terrorist. Collins said he has spent a lot of time thinking about how easy it would be” the affidavit explained. Based on his replies law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on Collins’ home in Centennial a Denver suburb nearly three weeks later. In addition to the silencers and guns investigators also found ballistic gear. While the Collins arrest is a reassuring reminder that federal law enforcement’s processes intended to catch such would-be infiltrators are working it also leaves the ominous sense that there likely are men who are better liars capable of eluding detection by polygraph who have gained access to the ranks of federal agencies. After all the FBI itself recently warned that law enforcement generally was being targeted for infiltration by right-wing extremists of a variety of ideological stripes including white supremacists and “Patriot” conspiracists. And very few such agencies outside of the federal government even create an emphasis to screen for such extremists let alone require polygraph tests to detect them.
