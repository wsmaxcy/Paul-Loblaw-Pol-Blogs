L, Language of the Night - The Dance of Authority (Part II), Jeffersonian DemocratforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-05-10, We begin in the text with our ‘story’ the first movement of our dance which moves on an appropriate note of tragedy: the refusal of Yavanna’s request to Fëanor for the Silmarils. As we have been discussing Fëanor possesses Germanic and heroic characteristics and has an exemplary function ad malum exemplum of all that Tolkien criticized within the heroic code of Northern courage. Beginning with Fëanor’s fateful decision we witness the criticism that Tolkien expressed in his academic writing and correspondence as it is dramatized in the exemplary nature of the history of the Eldar  (Chapter III p. 41). Walter Haug draws our attention to this technique in the vernacular medieval German tradition: The exemplary nature of history gives poetry a specific function namely lêre (‘teaching’) since it lifts historical events from their actual linear sequence and sees them simply as a reflection of the changing relationship between God and his people. In the face of the absolute history is reduced to a series of isolated incidents a mere collection of exempla. (Haug 2006) Fëanor and the history of the Eldar show us what it means to choose to pervert Eru’s gifts by excessive pride and possessiveness and it also shows the changing nature of the relationship between the Elves and Ilúvatar as the punishment of wyrd the ‘long defeat’ attempts to correct the original misdeed of Fëanor. Here the discussion backs up a bit to the Darkening of the Trees and the initial perversion and misuse of gifts violation of proper gift-giving and the subsequent activation of wyrd as a judicial balancing force.  Verlyn Flieger (2009 151) for instance notes that “[T]he contradiction resides in the simultaneous presence in his [Tolkien’s] invented world of two opposing principles fate and free will imagined as operating side by side sometimes in conflict sometimes independent.” And she goes on further to say “[T]he trouble lies not with free will but with fate.” However this may not necessarily be the case if we consider the role of Northern courage in the history of the Elves and their fate within Arda. In Tolkien’s Legendarium Fate (in the second mode of wyrd particularly Anglo-Saxon thought on wyrd) is inextricably woven together ‘fused’ (BMC 20) with the heroic imagination and the northern temperament of iron will. F. Anne Payne (1974 34) writes of wyrd as the weight man’s noblest efforts are anchored to; the heroic imagination his highest form of perception and commitment is all that gives him freedom in the face of the knowledge that what he strives for will in the end be seen as inadequate.  While the providence of Eru Ilúvatar’s music is already always present in Arda wyrd is conjured within Arda by this refusal to Yavanna and further firmly established by the Kin-slaying and subsequent Doom of the Noldor until it is broken by Galadriel’s eucatastrophe on the cusp of the Fourth Age. Until that point the Legendarium’s narrative engages in a discursive dance between wyrd and providence which subtly affects the Elvish-Germanic story and plot. Free will and freedom of choice are the first crucial elements in our Alfredian dynamic. In the Consolatio the Prisoner confirms to Wisdom It is as you say that God gives freedom to everyone to do whatever he wishes good or evil and you say that God knows everything before it happens; and you say that nothing happens unless God wishes or permits it and you say that it must all come about as he has decided . (ADCP V p 32 i  383) Fëanor exercises his Ilúvatar-given freedom of choice yet that freedom of choice is motivated by his possessiveness. Verlyn Flieger (2009 166-67) rightly points out that this is a crucial moment in the narrative in that Fëanor refuses Yavanna request for the Silmarils: “This thing I will not do of free will” (S 83) but in Flieger’s view the Elves do not have free will . Flieger’s doubt notwithstanding her notation of the ‘event’ demands more attention It seems wyrd in all senses of the word. Tolkien has again muddied the waters by suggesting that if Fëanor’s response had been different that the difference might have affected his subsequent deeds. But now (my [Flieger’s] emphasis) his choice brings on the Doom of the Noldor. Free will can apparently invite fate. As noted earlier doom is derived from Anglo-Saxon dòm. While its primary meaning is: “I. judgement decree ordinance law” it has also a rare usage listed as IV. “Will free will choice option” (Bosworth-Toller). Thus Fëanor’s impractical choice to deny Yavanna the Silmarils and his consequent oath to pursue Morgoth bring on the choice of the Noldor to follow him which leads to their Doom. Though that doom is spoken in the voice of Mandos it is the Noldor who in effect doom themselves. (Flieger 2009 167) Keeping in mind Alfred’s translation Tolkien’s waters do not seem muddied at all but rather highly sophisticated writing. It is in full agreement with the ‘Romano-Christianized Anglo-Saxon tradition’ especially as Ida Gordon (1979 47n) phrased it “[W]yrd is often equated in Christian poetry and homily with the workings of God’s will especially with reference with the Doom to come…” Because of Fëanor’s excessive possessiveness (Flieger 2002 110; Shippey 2005 273-76) is inherent in his character he believes that the Silmarils are his by right:  In Tolkien’s Alfredian order Ilúvatar is the supreme creator and gift-giver the One in which the inspiration the light the trees etc. were given to Arda through the mediation of Yavanna who sub-created the light. Fëanor simply by his character-traits is blind to the fact that he is merely a sub-sub-creator (although highly ‘gifted’ one in the cræft of talent). Once again Wisdom drives the point home:  In Alfred’s Consolatio Frakes reminds us that “Mankind’s greed [or Fëanor’s possessiveness] is so predominant that Wisdom can no longer exercise control over his own servants and has even been drawn to false goods himself (18 1-3) Since the goods have a divine origin according to Alfred this perversion of them by human greed is an attack on the natural divine order of the cosmos” (Frakes 1988 105). Fëanor’s refusal is an unwise use – a perversion of his gifts – both of his talent and of the material Silmarils. This of course has enormous consequences; consequences that drive our story. The most salient are the effects of the wyrd he has immediately activated and the chain of cause and effect which leads to the Doom and the Germanic narrative. What is at play here is his freedom of choice and if chosen wrongly the attention of Ilúvatar is brought down upon the chooser/actor in the form of wyrd: Man in his right to choose to dislocate the texture of things because he lacks omniscience performs acts which require the direct attention of God. This attention Alfred calls Wyrd the work that God does every day (128.18-20) … Since in the same passage Alfred makes it clear that all other events in the universe are set by natural law from the beginning of time the work of God can be drawn forth only by those beings free to disrupt the perfect pattern of things. Wyrd is the balance that keeps the free choices of men from rending the universe astray. The universe must operate in terms of an order of its own and if men’s choices threaten it deliberately evil or merely humanly inadequate Wyrd comes against them. (Payne 1974 18) The heroic nature of Fëanor makes him free to disrupt the “perfect pattern of things” and furthermore there is no need for an obvious divine intervention here: Ilúvatar can simply rely on “the natures of Fëanor and his sons being what they are” (Kocher 1980 26). Richard Purtill (1984 124) notes that “Tolkien plainly means to say that Fëanor made the wrong choice showing how it led to disaster for himself and for those who follow him how the first evil choice led to murder and treachery and other crimes” – ad malum exemplum.  For example what applies to Beowulf below also applies to Fëanor:  Wyrd is the force that eventually destroys the lives of the violators of unknowable universal order in the world of Beowulf. It is the agent in the most terrible experience of the day of death. It is the opponent of man in the strange area of the most intense perception and consciousness. Though it may hold off for a while the individual in the end makes an error in choice and releases forces whose consequences at the moment of crises he controls no longer and Wyrd is victorious. Wyrd affects only those with the strength and energy to enter that space where order is at first contingent on their choices. When they fail as they inevitably do because they are human Wyrd’s dreadful power compensates for their inadequacies. While it is completely accurate to say in epic and tragedy in general that the hero seeks his fate it is totally erroneous to say he seeks his Wyrd. Wyrd is alien to the individual; it is the force which balances his errors punishes him at best tolerates him. Wyrd is always the Other. (Payne 1974 15-16)  As Flieger has pointed out wyrd comes into existence from the Elves themselves. Born in the discourse more likely than not between Fëanor and the Valar that disrupts Eru’s unknowable order. That is the themes that even the Valar are not fully cognizant of in the Music of the Ainur. Ilúvatar’s “order” seems to be contingent on the strength and energy of Fëanor’s character creations and actions in this matter as Fëanor himself has the courage to rebuke the Herald of Manwë: “… and it may be that Eru has set in me a fire greater than thou knowest” (S 91). To paraphrase Frakes Fëanor may be referring here to a plan of foreþonc (of which wyrd is subservient) that remains as a plan in God’s mind along with prouidencia and thus not within the realm of materia. That is however until the plan is executed and it enters the material realm as wyrd yet still subservient to foreþonc or God (Frakes 1988 166).  Wyrd is then given a sort of consistency in the form of the Oath and call to everlasting darkness. It is explicitly stated after the Kinslaying appropriately by the Herald of Mandos and reified in the Prophecy of the North. That it may “hold off for a while” is evident in the proclamation of Mandos but it is not very long as Tolkien tells us before the first “fruits” are felt after the Great Burning of the ships “[T]his was the first fruits of the Kinslaying and the Doom of the Noldor” (S 97). At this point and at many points thereafter in the narrative the dance of wyrd certainly seems wrathful. It takes providence to lead wyrd and to intervene when wyrd’s steps appear in danger of dancing outside the divine plan.  In his 1954 edition of The Works of Sir Thomas Malory Eugène Vinaver (Vinaver 1954 viii) astutely observed that Malory’s work was an elaborate fabric woven out of a number of themes which alternated with one another like the threads of a tapestry: a fabric whose growth and development had been achieved not by a process of indiscriminate expansion but by means of a consistent lengthening of each thread … [W]ith great consistency though with varying degrees of success he endeavoured to break up the complex structure of his sources and replace their slowly unfolding canvas of recurrent themes by a series of self-contained stories.  Tolkien in his ‘heroic romance’ uses the interlacing technique to remind us of its connections to much more than is outside the confines of the self-contained story. The themes of Northern courage wyrd and providence dance in and out of the story and always remind us of the world in which their movements take place. These reminders are always “merely implicit” (Vinaver 1971 85). This technique of interlace or what C.S. Lewis calls ‘polyphonic’ (1954 97) and Tasso called ‘natural multiplicity’ (Davenport 2004 271) weaves various story threads that “tangle and untangle cross and recross in accordance with a carefully prearranged plan of narrative coincidences and interdependencies” (Ryding 1971 16).  In other words it is “a device of interweaving a number of separate themes” (Vinaver 1971 71). Vinaver (ibid. 76) cites C.S. Lewis (C.S. Lewis 1954 98) to further explain that Interlace is evident in the story of the Eldar Days in particular the three ‘Great Tales’ which interlace improbable adventures among themselves and yet as Vinaver suggests of Malory are self-contained tales in and of themselves. The three ‘Great Tales’ are Beren and Lúthien The Children of Húrin and The Fall of Gondolin. A reader may pick up anyone of these stories and read a self-contained tale even if they have not read The Silmarillion or any of Tolkien’s works for that matter. Nevertheless the Great Tales all interlace with one another. For example the meeting of Tuor with the Finarfins Gelmir and Arminas (FG 152-55) interlaces with their meeting Túrin in Nargothrond (CH 171-75) as does the espying of Túrin at the pool of Ivrin: “But they knew not that Nargothrond had fallen and this was Túrin son of Húrin the Blacksword” (FG 179). The same episode from Túrin’s point of view is only narrated in the first paragraph of Chapter XII (CH 182) and he does not notice them. Therefore The Children of Húrin does not reciprocate the interlace of this particular episode. Another example is Mablung when he states “More do I dread this errand of the King than the hunting of the Wolf” (ibid. 203) which interlaces with the hunt for the tormented wolf Carcharas in Beren and Lúthien: “That great wolf had run in madness through all the woods of the North and death and devastation went with him. Mablung alone escaped to bear the news of his coming to Thingol” (BL 139). These are but a sample but one may find much much more throughout Tolkien’s entire Legendarium. Indeed the use of interlace in this fashion gives the feeling that “this is the sort of thing that goes on all the time that it was going on before we arrived and will continue after we have left” which achieves “some depth in the treatment of characters and situation” (Davenport 2004 273).  We may note that in the ‘Great Tale’ The Fall of Gondolin The Lord of Waters Ulmo has his own ‘divine plan’ in motion. No doubt under the auspices of the Great Authority but Ulmo’s plan is explicit rather than implicit and self-contained within the tale. Yet it still operates under the same conditions as Ilúvatar’s providence mode. In the last version of the ‘Great Tale’ the Noldo Gelmir tells Tuor “Farewell! And think not that our meeting was by chance; for the Dweller in the Deep moves many things in this land still” (FG 155 emphasis mine).  The movements of providence’s dance are usually but certainly not always provided by a clue referencing ‘chance’. Readers of The Lord of the Rings will recognize Tolkien’s “finger of God” and its use with technique of interlace. Richard West (2003 86) notes that This technique of interlace shows itself very early in the Quenta Silmarillion. For example when “on a time it chanced that Oromë rode eastward in his hunting” and found the Firstborn awakened so that “the Valar found at last as it were by chance those whom they had so long awaited” (S 45-46). In the narrative of the Eldar providence begins its dance steps very early on.  By using the motif ‘by chance’ Tolkien is in effect negating chance within the ordo of the Legendarium. Nothing happens ‘by chance’ (OE adv. wêas) in Arda. This too may be supported within the framework of the Alfredian Consolatio: The unexpected result (unwenunga gebirede 140 10-11) of an act is similar to Aristotle’s rare/unusual event. That chance is not an efficient cause but only incidental to an efficient cause is present in Alfred’s denial that anything occurs outside of God’s ultimate control. And that such events are teleological is assumed in this subjection to God’s beneficent order. (Frakes 1988 119) It is only the epistemological gap (ibid. 120) (that the Valar share but to much less a degree) that prevents Elves and Men from fully understanding the divine ordo of Ilúvatar. Hence Tolkien’s second part of the motif ‘if chance is what you call it’. Wisdom in the Alfredian text denies that Aristotle’s farmer who happened to find gold buried in his field was caused by any chance whatsoever rather it was providence who led the farmer to the riches as part of the divine plan: Therefore it was not found by chance but divine providence guided the one whom he wanted so that he hid the gold and again the one whom he wanted so that he found it.  (ADCP V p 31 ii 379)  Lastly there are providence’s moves to lead and guide wyrd along the divine plan. Here we are speaking of ‘ill chance’. For example when Túrin demands to be led to the hillock by the Crossings of Teiglin where Finduilas the Elf-maiden was recently buried the captain of Brethil turns to his men and says ‘Too Late! This is a piteous chance. But see: here lies the Mormegil himself [Túrin laying in grief upon the mound] the great captain of Nargothrond. By his sword we should have known him as did the Orcs.’ (CH 195)  This is one more dance-step of Túrin’s doom or wyrd. It was caused by a fateful decision of Túrin and its effect will be to cause Túrin to make another fateful decision. Nonetheless it was not chance piteous ill or otherwise: it was the divine plan all along. In the Alfredian framework states Frakes (1988 120) Only in the reduced sense ‘unexpected or inexplicable event’ (which is nonetheless governed by providence) does casus survive and this only in the general Alfredian term wyrd: þe we þonne hatað wyrd þonne se gesceadwisa God þe ælces monnes ðearfe wat hwæt wyrcð oððe geþafað þæs þe we ne wenað” (132 20-22). Weas gebyrian is obliterated and wyrd remains as the often unexpected and epistemological unfathomable event which nevertheless stems from the divine plan.  The dance of Authority in Arda spans the entire Legendarium from The Silmarillion and the ‘Great Tales’ to (although not discussed here) The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is a series of interactions of causes and effects between three modes of Authority. Firstly fatum as the Music of the Ainur which binds all living things except Men to the confines of Arda; secondly the wyrd invoked by the Germanic hero Fëanor’s freedom of choice to refuse Yavanna which is seemingly malevolent to those it affects but in truth is another aspect of divine will. Wyrd acts within an Alfredian framework as an agent of judgement punishment and correction; thirdly providence as divine will which at crucial times will insert itself as “the finger of God.” Tolkien wrote a series of self-contained stories that with great consistency interwove various themes but by no means limited simply to the theme of divine Authority and its modes discussed here. His Legendarium does not lend itself to either a reduction to a single theme or to a mechanical division (Vinaver 2001 545) but rather to a wide tapestry of interweaving narrative threads. The end result as C. S. Lewis (1954 98) put it is a very “lifelike consistency” in that all the adventures bear the stamp of the world that produced them have the right flavor make each other probable; in its apparent planlessness – they collide and get mixed up with one another and drift apart just as events in the real world; in its infinity – we can so obviously never get to the end of them there are obviously more and more round the next corner.
