L, The Medina Spirit Cancel Culture Reference Reminds me of Emily Litella, SWalkerwillgotojail, 2021-05-11, Listening to Bob Baffert say that cancel culture is attacking him for his horse’s failing drug tests is like Stephen Miller claiming that cancel culture is after him for hating South American children.      Mr. Baffert has been caught doping horses at least 29 times over his career ( news.yahoo.com/… ) .  I am sure that the 29 times that he was caught were the only times that he ever drugged his horses. And I am also sure that the horses asked for the drugs.  If the horses ask for illegal help what is Baffert supposed to do? He is torn by a constant struggle between keeping his horses happy (drugged) and doing the right thing.   Actually Baffert has long lost the ability to reason right from wrong.  It is about winning at all cost.  DOES THIS REMIND YOU OF ANYONE?. Would djt have drugged people to win the election in a heartbeat.  He tried to have Mike “the lapdog” Pence killed.  djt never faced any consequences.  “Mike the lapdog” thanked him and asked for more please.  Every meme has to reach its apex. I believe that Bob Baffert’s claim that getting caught 29 times and claiming that he is being “cancelled” is a Harvey Weinstein achievement and deserves all the scorn that comes to him. I wish him well in his retirement at Mar a Lago with his like minded brother.  Bob would be smart to quote the great Emily Letella NEVER MIND.   Full disclosure my father owned harness race horses.  He was a farmboy that loved horses and in his retirement he spent his time racing a horse in Iowa  He never won a race.  He just wanted to be outside with horses.  Another horse owner went through his equipment chest and found that he had DMSO.  DMSO is a drug that dissolves through the skin and is used for sore joints.  I first read about DMSO in running magazines in the 1970’s.  DMSO was illegal in Iowa my father did not know.  My father was banned from racing in Iowa for 2 years.  HOW CAN BOB BAFFERT GET CAUGHT 29 TIMES AND HE IS STILL A HORSE RACING GOD?
