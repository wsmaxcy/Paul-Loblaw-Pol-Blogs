Join us and share your thoughts projects questions and tips. Quilters here are at many different levels of skill. Beginners and non-quilters are welcome too. We NEED diarists!Your diary can be elaborate and full of photos a simple story of your own quilting history or that of someone you love a discussion of a current project or a technique you're learning new adventures... You could post quilt retreat-day recipes (things like crockpot meals so food appears without much attention from you)...We could do show and tell or open thread also but either way we need diarists to host. It is EASY if you're willing to take the chance. Diary Schedule 04/26 — OPEN 05/02 — OPEN 05/09 — OPEN Many of you can recognize the pattern at the top—a simple log cabin. What makes it even simpler is that I bought the fabric precut for a log cabin. As you can tell their are two slightly different color patterns which I wanted to give the throw more interest. A very September looking quilt IMHO. All I had to do was sew the easy straight seams and decide on the border.  Interestingly I went looking last night for more of these kits and didn’t find as many as before. Obviously you can buy different precut 2.5” strips and cut them to size but I was focusing on the easiest quilts.  Here is another log cabin. This one is finished and I arranged the blocks differently. Again a precut kit except for the borders and binding. Another easy to make quilt focuses on using panels. Not all panels are quick. I am working on a panel  for my brother outlining the key elements in various colored threads. That involves a lot of hand quilting. However other panel quilts are easier. This one is for my sister. I made it a bit harder than it would have to be with the star blocks and the 3 rows of 2” squares. This could have been done with simply a couple of borders. The overall quilting of butterflies (not done by me) definitely adds to the quilt.  Below is probably the simplest type of quilt a quilt Norm did for NN VA project in Detroit basically 5” charm squares sewn together.   So what easier to make quilts (none are truly easy) have you made? What quilts are you working on now?
