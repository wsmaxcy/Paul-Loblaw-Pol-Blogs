L, What Republicans SayAnd What They Really Mean, Perlinator, 2021-06-29, When Republicans say:      “I’m against regulating gun sales because it would violate the Second Amendment!” They really mean:      “I’m against regulating gun sales because I’ve been paid off by the NRA.”  When Republicans say:     “I’m against Medicare for All because it’s socialism and because it’s too expensive and because it won’t work...” They really mean:     “I’m against Medicare for All because I’ve been paid off by the insurance companies.”  When Republicans say:     “I’m against raising the minimum wage because it would crash the economy!” They really mean:     “I’m against raising the minimum wage because I’ve been paid off by big business.”  When Republicans say:     “I’m against health and safety regulations because they’re all just bureaucratic red tape that gets in the way of freedom!” They really mean:    “I’m against health and safety regulations because I’ve been paid off by big corporations.”  When Republicans say:     “I believe that global warming is a hoax because the science is not conclusive!” They really mean:     “I pretend to believe that global warming is a hoax because I’ve been paid off by the fossil fuel industry.”  When Republicans say:     “I’m in favor of increased restrictions on voting in order to put a stop to rampant voter fraud!” They really mean:     “I’m in favor of increased restrictions on voting because the only way we can win is to disenfranchise as many voters as we can.”  When Republicans say:     “I’m outraged about the Democratic President’s recent gaffe because it was uncouth unpresidential and unpatriotic!” They really mean:     “I’m pretending to be outraged about the Democratic President’s recent gaffe because my party can’t win on our policies so we try to distract everyone from the issues and get them riled up over nonsense.”  When Republicans say:     “The news media has a liberal bias!” They really mean:     “The news media reported the facts about another Republican scandal.”
