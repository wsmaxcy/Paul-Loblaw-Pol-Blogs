L, Child Separation At The Border Still A Problem - Despite A Small Victory, noahwil, 2021-05-03, Some good news at the Mexican border. The Biden administration is finally starting to see some movement on reuniting children separated from parents at the US/Mexican border. AP News is reporting that 4 families were reunited today — including two mom’s who had been separated from their kids since 2017.  But let’s not forget that this is just a drop in the ocean. There were 5500 children who were separated from their parents since this heinous policy was started with the last administration in 2017. There are still more than 1000 children locked up away from their families. And even these 4 families have only been united thanks to the efforts of the American Civil Liberties Union to bring a court case against the government in San Diego. We’re now more than 100 days into this administration. I for one hope that the ACLU continue to push the Biden administration to completely end child separation at the the Mexican border.
