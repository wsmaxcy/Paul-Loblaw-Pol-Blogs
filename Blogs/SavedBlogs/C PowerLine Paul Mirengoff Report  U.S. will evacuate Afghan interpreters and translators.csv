C, Report:  U.S. will evacuate Afghan interpreters and translators, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-06-24, Yesterday  per the Washington Post I  criticized the Biden administration for having no plan in place to evacuate Afghan interpreters translators and others who provided similar services to the U.S. in the struggle against the Taliban. These folks who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us in the war on terrorism are bogged down in a visa application process that according to the Post is woefully inadequate. Thus they were likely to be stranded in Afghanistan when as seems inevitable the Taliban conquers that country. Now however  Politico reports that the U.S. is planning to evacuate thousands of interpreters and translators from Afghanistan. They will be moved to safety while they await the processing of their visa applications. According to Politico the U.S. government has identified a group of these applicants already in the special visa pipeline for lift out of the country. Is the scope of the government’s plan sufficient? Rep. Tom Malinwoski (D-N.J.) a leading advocate of large-scale evacuation  isn’t convinced of that. And even if we evacuate all of the interpreters and translators it’s likely that the Taliban will massacre a great many Afghans who sided with the U.S. but did not provide these kinds of services. Nonetheless I’m glad to learn that perhaps in response to criticism from the Washington Post the Biden administration seems to be moving in the right direction on this matter.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
