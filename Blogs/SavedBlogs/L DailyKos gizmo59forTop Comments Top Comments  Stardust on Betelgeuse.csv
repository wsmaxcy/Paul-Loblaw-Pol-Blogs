L, Top Comments:  Stardust on Betelgeuse, gizmo59forTop Comments, 2021-07-03, About 7 months ago I wrote a post about astronomical observations of the dimming of the red supergiant star Betelgeuse and what that dimming might imply.  The fate of red supergiants is to end their lives in a supernova explosion and so there was speculation that Betelgeuse’s dimming might be a signal that the supernova was about to occur.  However Betelgeuse did not go supernova and the star’s behavior appears to have returned to normal.  So what happened to dim the star?  Astronomers now believe they know. The surface of Betelgeuse is always changing. Giant bubbles of gas grow shrink and move around within the star and occasionally it burps one out. Before the Great Dimming began Betelgeuse released one of these bubbles. Then a patch of the star’s surface cooled down and this temperature drop allowed the gas to cool enough to condense into solid dust. The newly formed stardust capable of diffusing and absorbing a significant amount of starlight from the star greatly reduced the amount of light getting to the Earth from this star.  This is what caused the apparent dimming of Betelgeuse.   This is nowhere nearly as interesting as a supernova explosion but it is interesting to understand that production of stardust is capable of reducing starlight by such a large amount.
