L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Rhonda Furin, republicinsanity, 2021-05-02, Welcome to what is the 983rd profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Rhonda Furin a 2020 candidate for California’s 45th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives and who is currently claiming she’s making a run for Governor of California hoping to be named the replacement to Gavin Newsom by attacking him for doing anything about Covid-19 (Thus guaranteeing that Newsom’s job is probably safe because YIKES RHONDA FURIN IS NUTTY).We’re not going to directly link to Furin’s Twitter account because it’s just a soup of retweeting the most paranoid right-wing nut-jobs on the internet with little context including indiscernible anti-vaccination lunacy and a non-stop alert about sex-trafficking that oddly neglects to mention anything happening with say Matt Gaetz.That being the case it should come as little surprise that Rhonda Furin was a huge supporter of the Qanon conspiracy theory throughout her campaign for Congress being yet the latest Republican to make a Congressional run while raving about Q. Furin was drinking the Q-oolAid enough to even believe the sub-conspiracy theory within it that JFK Jr. faked his own death and was going to re-emerge to scandalize Democrats and join the GOP ticket as the VP candidate for Trump’s 2020 ticket wearing the T-shirt to prove it.Rhonda Furin finished seventh out of a possible seven candidates running for California’s 45th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020 utterly failing in her dream to unseat the amazing Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter. We predict she’ll continue to be out of her mind and fail to be elected.
