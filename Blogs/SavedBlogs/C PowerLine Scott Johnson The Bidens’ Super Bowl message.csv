C, The Bidens’ Super Bowl message, Scott Johnson, 2021-02-08, I found intense drama in the Bidens’ brief message before the Super Bowl yesterday (video below). What was the over/under on the number of takes necessary to get this one? How many words would the president slur while giving the thing his best effort in the final take? Could he run his tribute to “essential workers” by us just one more time so we can dub that in a little more clearly? Would he make it to the end zone? Would he remember to display his dental work for emphasis before reaching the end zone? Would the assembled multitude hold their applause before during and after the remarks? Would the players restrain their enthusiasm?  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
