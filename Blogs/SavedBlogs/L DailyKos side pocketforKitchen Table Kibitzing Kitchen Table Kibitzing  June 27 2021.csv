L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing  June 27 2021, side pocketforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-06-27, Fraught Climate I have written so much about the drought but it’s subject number one around here and all over the west. Much of our water comes from reservoirs and presently many of them are at new lows and in some cases dry. Cities are putting in place restrictions on water use in some cases up to 50%. Rivers which were flooding only two years ago are down to a trickle. The crisis has a ripple effect. Low river levels impact those wells that are drilled near the water many of which are used to irrigate vineyards. Much of our power is hydroelectric and low reservoirs are threatening the ability to generate electricity. This is at a time when rising temperatures demand more power for A/C and pumping from underground sources. And wells are going dry as aquifers are depleted. Rivers support fishing and recreation and both are threatened. Tourism is affected in a wide area as the drought makes destinations less desirable. Agriculture uses between 40% and 80% of our water. (Varies widely on google sources). Cattle herds are being sold off due to the cost of water and feed costs have skyrocketed. California alone produces 13 % of all food grown in the U.S. but a huge percentage of the fresh fruit and vegetables. 90% of the broccoli and avocados! Avocado toast! And now we’re on to restaurants. Food prices will go up; they have started already. Water will be served only by request. Vineyards are already thinning grapes to save water leading to scarcity and higher prices.  The trending diary by Rule of Claw is about the unprecedented heatwave in the Pacific Northwest. The comments are from all over and describe the heat and drought as it is affecting folks in the west. This rather short-term weather phenomenon has focussed attention on the reality of climate change. The drought on the other hand has developed more slowly and I fear its reality hasn’t totally sunk in. “Oh it’ll rain next year.” Golf courses are green. Venues are crowded. I suspect the joys of reopening are limiting the drought reality and in some ways that’s a good thing. But without substantial precipitation in the next few years our lifestyles will be radically modified. Maybe too dire a subject for KTK but will soon be considered at kitchen tables everywhere in the west. Are you experiencing the drought? What steps are being done for coping or remediation? Are there other climate changes evident in your area? Is climate change real to those where you live? Well the world is still a beautiful place. Here is our lovely Spring Lake which right now is filled with...water.
