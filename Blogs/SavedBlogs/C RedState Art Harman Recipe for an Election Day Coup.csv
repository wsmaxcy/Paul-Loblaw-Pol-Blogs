C, Recipe for an Election Day Coup?, Art Harman, 2020-11-03,  The president’s son Donald J. Trump Jr. today outlined a scary scenario which the Democrats and media might try to pull off to incite riots and terrorism and delegitimize a victory by President Trump. Speaking on the Rush Limbaugh Show Don Jr. warned that one or more networks may deliberately and falsely call the race for Joe Biden long before sufficient votes are in perhaps based on biased exit polling. With that declaration Biden would give his acceptance speech and demand that President Trump concede. The networks would then amplify that demand and ‘experts’ would declare the military may have to be used to oust him. Headlines would blare “Trump stealing election.” Democrat anger would rise to record levels even as a Trump victory may be solidifying. Thus incited the rioters already taking the streets around the country and well-provisioned with weapons food bail money and trained in terrorist tactics would then go full terrorist because “Trump stole the election.” Essentially this could be stage one of a true 3rd-world-style coup designed to deny the president a clear victory no matter if he wins every state. As if to confirm this scenario former President Obama said that Trump “might declare victory before all the votes are counted tomorrow... that’s something a two-bit dictator does.” Jen O’Malley Dillon Joe Biden’s Campaign manager “Just because Donald Trump says something on election night or suggests he might be winning that is not going to be based in fact” and “under no scenario will Donald Trump be declared the victor on election night.” Biden reportedly has no plans to concede tonight and Hillary told Biden in August that he “should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out and eventually I do believe he will win if we don’t give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.” Democrats have continually accused President Trump of refusing to honor the results of elections however it is the Democrats who are refusing to honor the votes of the American people. A very strong win by Trump can make these ‘coup’ plans useless. That’s what we should all hope and pray for. —————————————————————— Read More Red State Articles by Art Harman Art Harman is the President of the Coalition to Save Manned Space Exploration a space advocacy organization supporting the return to the moon by 2024.
