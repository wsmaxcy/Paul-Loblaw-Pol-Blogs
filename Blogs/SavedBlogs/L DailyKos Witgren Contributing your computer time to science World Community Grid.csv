L, Contributing your computer time to science: World Community Grid, Witgren, 2021-04-19, I’m a huge fan of citizen science projects and have contributed hundreds of hours to things like bioblitzes and volunteer water monitoring and also quite a few hours online to the Zooniverse contributing to projects from transcribing weather logbooks from WW1 vessels around the world to characterizing details about galaxies or ID’ing animals photographed by camera traps (for more about the Zooniverse Mark Sumner did a diary about it earlier this year). I encourage people interested in such things to look into not only the Zooniverse but other citizen science offerings out there like The Lost Ladybug Project. There are even apps out there for the iPhones out there that will let you use the camera on your phone to help characterize light pollution levels in your area. But I wanted to write this diary to highlight a more passive way you can help out: The World Community Grid created and managed by IBM. By installing the necessary software (a platform called BOINC which stands for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing)   on your computer (and there is also an app for smartphones as well) you can sign up to various projects and dedicate part of your spare computer power to things like mapping cancer markers characterize proteins in order to characterize the human microbiome or use your computer to help run pieces of high-resolution weather simulations to make better weather predictions in Africa that will be compared to existing weather data helping forecasters refine their weather models and forecasting for the African continent. One of the newest projects is a result of the COVID pandemic — the OpenPandemics project has been created to not only do molecular simulations looking for promising therapeutics for COVID-19 but is also looking at proteins in SARS-COV-1 and also using information learned to help create a toolkit for improving response in the next pandemic. WCG is always evolving with some projects finishing their work new projects coming online and some that have been going on for quite a long time. The great thing about WCG is it operates in the background while you do other things on your computer. If the app detects that your computer usage increases beyond a certain level (which you can also custom set if you like) WCG will temporarily pause operation so that your computer isn’t bogged down. So if you’re trying to stream the latest Marvel movie on your laptop or are trying to do a bit of high-power PC gaming no worries. It’ll resume operation when CPU usages falls again. So you can literally contribute to science and medicine while browsing DKos! How much do I believe in WCG’s efforts? Here is what my contribution looks like. As you can see I’ve been contributing for nearly 12 years and have contributed almost 7 years(!) of computing time (counted on a per-core basis) across multiple devices. When you have tens or hundreds of thousands of personal computers sharing computing time devoted to pieces of a larger puzzle it all adds up. In effect all of these computers each offering a bit of their computing power can rival powerful supercomputers in their ability to rapidly crunch through large amounts of data. I should mention again that joining the WCG first requires installation of the BOINC software and BOINC can also be used for other distributed computing projects not affiliated with WCG. SETI@Home (currently paused) for example uses the BOINC platform as does ClimatePrediction.Net (which uses the participants’ computers to run pieces of climate models) and MilkyWay@Home (which uses participants’ computers and data from the Sloan Deep Field Survey to create highly detailed 3-D maps of the Milky Way galaxy). The BOINC website has a listing of other such distributed computing projects if you want to look projects outside the sphere of WCG (though WCG is one of those listed).  Here is a screenshot of the six projects currently underway at WCG: Oh one last thing a favor: if you decide to join WCG and give it a try use this link to sign up — it’ll get me credit for recruitment and get me a WCG recruitment badge on my account. ;) I’ll kinda-sorta be around if there are questions in the comments but can’t make any guarantees — I had a medical procedure today and am alternating between groggy napping lucid wakefulness and “OMG why did I just move like that ow.”  So no promises.
