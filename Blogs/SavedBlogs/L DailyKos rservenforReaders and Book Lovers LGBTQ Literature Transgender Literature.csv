A little over a year ago I was faced with finding a productive way to spend the pandemic.  Given that I am in my 70s and at that time was recovering from a serious fall (foot and arm injuries) and a nasty urinary infection it was obvious that anything physical was not in the picture.  As a retired mathematics professor I figured stimulating my brain was the way to go.  What better way to do that than reading? I discovered very early on that having so much time to read was itself a problem.  It didn't take long before I had read the most recent book in the offerings of several different authors I had been following. I discovered that almost unanimously their next book would be available in November of 2021.  I hate that.  Don't you? Okay What then?  I decided I needed a specific project.  I decided to survey the state of transgender fiction. Now back when I transitioned (1992-1994).  Transgender fiction was quite awful.  Most of it was centered on forced feminization/BDSM which didn't interest me in the least.  From what I have gleaned from shopping at Amazon that sort of offering still exists. Still not interested.  For better stories one had to turn to something like the 1976 play Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean by Ed Graczyk or a side plot in John Irving's The World According to Garp (1979). Irving is still at it (see In One Person). I wanted to avoid any of the varying degrees of pornographic that are available (the type of thing which paints us as sex perverts in the eyes of the right wing) so I took a cue from a high school friend who is an acclaimed author of young adult fiction.  Her name is now Randall Platt.  You should check her out sometime. So even at the age of 72 (now 73) I immersed myself in YA transgender literature.  I found a couple of authors to recommend.  I also discovered that I still have issues with the genre. First up is an author who goes by the single name Shiraz. The series I recommend has so far 5 volumes and is called Tammyverse since the central character has renamed herself Tammy Smart.  Tammy is in the upper sixth form at a private school in the Scottish Highlands.  She comes out in order to portray Anita in a local production of West Side Story.  Besides school she also works part time in a local women's clothing shop.  Her supportive father is a retiring banker while her unsupportive mother is having an affair with an Albanian gangster.  She has a lot of support in the community but not everything goes well.  There are attempted kidnappings a physical attack on opening night of the play by one of the teachers at the school and other odd events in the village of Thurso.  She becomes involved with both the local police and British Intelligence agents. Peace is on the horizon but it seems the path to reach it is winding with a lot of potholes. Many but not all of Ms. Bishop's novels are YA.  There are almost 40 of them. Most of the gender variant teens are quite intelligent and many have an unusual skill or a talent.  Sometimes a character learns they are intersex.  Sometimes a transition occurs with the aid of magic or pseudoscience which didn't please me. Ms. Bishop's transgender characters are mostly quite likable and there is usually a supportive parent or grandparent. So what are the issues I mentioned.  In Tammyverse Tammy Smart is quite wealthy.  She is her employer's landlady for instance as well as owning other property in Thurso and in London.  In the first few volumes she lives with the matriarch of clan McPherson so there are ever present household staff.  Need I say that is rarely the case for most transgirls?  I also was not as interested in clothing and makeup as the author appears to think I might be. Ms. Bishop is also quite enamored of describing clothing and makeup.  And her characters are uniformly unathletic small  and the target of bullies when they were younger.  I can't speak for all transwomen but that was not the case with me.  Additionally none of the characters have any interest in a lesbian relationship.  One comes to suspect that Ms. Bishop thinks heterosexual is the 'appropriate' sexuality for a woman.   I did not encounter any YA fiction featuring an ftm individual except tangentially to the main story in a couple of Ms. Bishops stories.  But if you are looking for something in the ftm literature a search this morning revealed a nonfiction account Becoming a Man: The Story of a Transition by P. Carl which looks quite good though I have yet to read it. If you are interested in taking any of the following dates please comment below or send a message to Chrislove.
