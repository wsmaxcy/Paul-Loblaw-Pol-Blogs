L, Liz Cheney's Answer On If She'd Ever Vote For Trump Stumps Fox News Anchor, David Moye, 2021-04-14, Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto was thrown for a loop by Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) on Wednesday. It happened after the Wyoming lawmaker condemned former President Donald Trump‚Äôs encouragement of the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill insurrection. Cheney who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump to be impeached for spurring on the riots told Cavuto the former president‚Äôs action ‚Äúwas the gravest violation of an oath of office by any president in American history.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt embrace insurrection. We can‚Äôt minimize what happened on Jan. 6.‚Äù Despite those strong comments Cavuto decided to ask Cheney if she planned to vote for Trump if he was the 2024 Republican presidential nominee. Her response was quick and to the point: ‚ÄúI would not.‚Äù As the video shows Cavuto seemed a little flummoxed by her response and didn‚Äôt know what else to say.
