C, Relevant classic texts (5), Scott Johnson, 2021-06-19, I want to add a few more paragraphs from Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) to Steve’s introduction and excerpts in “Relevant classic texts (4).” With the Terror yet to come Burke observed of those to whom he attributed the spirit of the revolution: “In the groves of their academy at the end of every vista you see nothing but the gallows….” (paragraphing added below). * * * * *  When I see the spirit of liberty in action I see a strong principle at work; and this for a while is all I can possibly know of it. The wild gas the fixed air is plainly broke loose: but we ought to suspend our judgments until the first effervescence is a little subsided till the liquor is cleared and until we see something deeper than the agitation of the troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure before I venture publicly to congratulate men on a blessing that they have really received one.  Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings. I should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France until I was informed how it had been combined with government; with public force; with the discipline and obedience of armies; with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue; with the solidity for property; with peace in order; with civil and social manners.  All these (in their way) are good things too; and without them liberty is not a benefit while it lasts and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is that they may do what they please: we ought to see what it will please them to do before we risk congratulations which may soon be turned into complaints. Prudence would dictate this in the case of separate insulated private men; but liberty when men act in bodies is power. Considerate people before they declare themselves will observe the use which is made of power; and particularly of so trying a thing as new power in new persons of whose principles tempers and dispositions they have little or no experience and in situations where those who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be the real movers. . . . On the scheme of this barbarous philosophy which is the offspring of cold hearts and muddy understandings and which is as void of solid wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance laws are to be supported only by their terrors and by the concern which each individual may find in them from his own private speculations or even spare to them from his own private interests. In the groves of their academy at the end of every vista you see nothing but the gallows. . . .  To make a government requires no great prudence. Settle the seat of power; teach obedience and the work is done. To give freedom is still more easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to let go the rein. But to form a free government; that is to temper together these opposite elements of liberty and restraint in one consistent work requires much thought deep reflection a sagacious powerful and combining mind. This I do not find in those who take the lead in the National Assembly.  Perhaps they are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather believe it. It would put them below the common level of human understanding. But when the leaders choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity their talents in the construction of the state will be of no service. They will become flatterers instead of legislators; the instruments not the guides of the people.  If any of them should happen to propose a scheme of liberty soberly limited and defined with proper qualifications he will be immediately outbid by his competitors who will produce something more splendidly popular. Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause. Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of cowards; and compromise as the prudence of traitors; until in hopes of preserving the credit which may enable him to temper and moderate on some occasions the popular leader is obliged to become active in propagating doctrines and establishing powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose at which he ultimately might have aimed. . . . The improvements of the National Assembly are superficial their errors are fundamental. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
