L, People are complicated. Good people do bad things. Very bad people do good things., Dem, 2021-05-08, I wrote the following comment in response to a diary written by somebody I like a lot a great writer.  Interesting story (Dick Cheney used his position as the person conducting the vice presidential candidate search to gather bad information about other republicans and be able to use it against him and Liz Cheney was a very important part of that) . I believe it and the explanation offered in the diary is the one which seems to me to be most likely to be true. Dick and Liz Cheney both are terrible people. Of that I have no doubt.  Returning to current events people are complicated. Really terrible people do a few good things because they are the right things to do. I became a democrat in 2005. 2004 was the last year I voted for a republican. 2005 was the last time that I voted for an independent when a democrat was running. By the middle of 2005 I was always voting for a democrat never voting for a republican and only voting for an independent if they were progressive and no democrat was available to vote for. Prior to that I had been a fundamentalist Christian and a conservative republican. Certainly being a republican just by itself alone means I was a terrible person. I served on 8 mission trips to Mexico helping local churches by doing whatever they asked and was happy to be able to give food and clothing to those in need. I was fortunate to be part of a team that helped start an orphanage in Mexico. I took a semester off from school to volunteer for Vision Ministries whose ministry was entirely practical and primarily consisted of again providing food and clothing for those in need. There are people who overall are horrible people but who are kind to their kids or do something kind for somebody else simply because it’s the right thing to do . There are good people who make a wretched choice and do something awful. Life is complicated. People are especially complicated. Why did republican defense secretaries including Cheney write the letter they did?  Why did President Bush denounce the insurrection as an insurrection when it happened? Why did President Bush say  “that’s some weird shit !” ? Why did John McCain name off dictators to Senator Klobuchar during a Trump speech? The simplest and to my mind most likely explanation is because what Trump did and said (or incited) went against their values and beliefs and not to extract some sort of revenge or in order to gain something politically. Most of their values and beliefs are likely to be fucked up but they likely have a few beliefs or values which we might share.  Prior to Trump their tribe was slightly more complicated. Trump rose to power due to how awful the vast majority of their voters are. Trump in most and many ways is the logical conclusion of a terrible terrible awful path the republicans have been on . They were awful explicitly and then they were awful but kind of disguised it and some might have fallen for it. As time went on they returned to being more and more blatant about their evil nature. The decent humans within increasingly felt pressure to leave and did so. Trump became the nominee and for me that was the end of the time when a decent person could vote republican because of how undeniably evil he is. In general once we were close to it (2012+) I believe that the later a person left the Republican Party (or stopped voting republican ) as the Trump era approached and commenced the more likely it is that most of their “values” are garbage (but if they did not vote for Trump then they have some (perhaps not many but a few) good values . The Republican Party has pursued voter suppression an evil bigotry to my way of thinking so so awful I can’t begin to truly explain how angry it makes me  for a very  long time.  (I was extremely ignorant and very very shallow politically in my previous life. I was a republican for one reason and one reason only . I believed “God” demanded it and although in my flawed and completely wrong belief eternal life was a free gift which could not be lost  I also believed that faith without works is dead . Hence I believed that if one apostasized or lived an evil life then that revealed that the person was never saved to begin with. Hell is a pretty strong motivator as is avoiding the shunning as I later painfully learned) .  Those politically active and who were leaders in the party knew this for certain as did anybody who sought the truth about the party. Still one could be ignorant and vote that way .  However [and some disagree with me here because as I wrote “people are complicated “] I just have a very very hard time believing that it was possible to vote for Trump without knowing the evil about Trump because exposure to it was universal . I find it impossible to believe that somebody could have voted for Trump even the first time without being aware of his bigotry because exposure to it was universal the same was true regarding his opposition to democracy the same was true of his opposition to following the law the same was true of his personal immorality and so on. By the time we get around to the time to vote in the general election of the presidential election of 2020 I don’t think there’s a chance in hell that anybody voted for him without knowing of a huge number of unbelievably large character flaws which would have made voting for him an absolute deal breaker for any decent human being. I can easily expand upon the evil known about him in 2016 .  Even more evil and much worse evil was known about Trump by November of 2020. Out of many I could list I will give only two simple examples that were known by every single Trump voter in 2016. Trump pushed birtherism which to any honest person who wanted to know the truth about where President Obama was born was a bullshit racist conspiracy theory. Nobody voted for Trump in November of 2016 without knowing that Trump pushed the bullshit theory which falsely claimed President Obama was born in Kenya. Second there is not a single person who voted for Trump in November of 2016 who did not know that Trump called for throwing his political opponent in prison at political rallies. The person who does that is the person who is a dictator in a third world banana republic. Nobody who loves democracy does that. These are only two of an extremely long list of truths some of which were known by all voters by November of 2016 and all of which were known by November of 2020.  I have no doubt that Dick and Liz Cheney are awful awful people. I don’t have any doubt about the event described in the diary which Crashing Vor wrote nor of the interpretation given by Crashing Vor. However the thesis that Liz Cheney opposed the insurrection and stated that Trump incited it in order to get revenge on Trump or for some other political reason strikes me as extremely unlikely. That doesn’t make Liz Cheney a good person. She isn’t. How does the story in the diary support the thesis ? It doesn’t. Any realistic evaluation of the event leads to Liz Cheney being hurt politically not Donald Trump. She knew she was in a minority in the Republican Party when she spoke against it. The Republican Party is the party of Trump and she knew it. She hasn’t backed down from it when Kevin McCarthy did and she surely would have if her goal was to hurt Trump as soon as she realized that this wasn’t going to happen among republicans. She had to know that Democrats and Democratic Party voters were not going to suddenly support her.  I don’t like having to say that their tribe is universally evil. I don’t enjoy it. I say it because I find it undeniable and it is essential because in my view our Democratic Party is very good with minor exceptions and the same is true of our leadership and well their party is exclusively a force for evil which if not destroyed will eradicate democracy in the United States. Their values are abhorrent. Their only value now as a party is to bow down to Donald Trump. Their leadership is about to exclusively hold that value; that will happen when they boot Liz Cheney from their leadership team. She is a bad person a bad human being. However that doesn’t mean that there is not one single good thing about her or that every single moral value of hers is wrong. She seems to have one value that I can find which is good (admittedly this is a low bar) and that is opposition to insurrection and a belief that whoever wins the popular vote in a state should receive its electoral college votes and whoever receives the most electoral college votes should become president. She seems to understand that Trump’s big lie is a big lie . All of this she has stated explicitly or made clear in public even though it will cost her her leadership position.  There were not a lot of republicans who went along with her in these things and that fact makes those who did so more valuable. If only Democrats denied the big lie and all republicans asserted the big lie and this line continued through the courts then the country would have had an even worse time of it. Having some important republicans join all democrats helped to clearly demarcate truth. Liz has rightly been derided for the evil she has done in the past. Yet when somebody who in general is a very bad person does something important which is good knowing it can only hurt them  then I find it preferable to be thankful and courteous to them. Otherwise we are telling those on the other side that if they do something good which helps the country we will only disparage them. This would mean that they get a whip only for doing something good from both sides and a carrot for doing something evil. There has been and will be plenty of time in the future to record all of her evil  especially as the history is written.
