L, Sangha for Sunday May 2 2021, Otteray Scribe, 2021-05-02, Welcome to members of the Daily Kos Sangha* and all interested visitors who happen by. Each of us has our own path; we come here by way of many different traditions and of no particular tradition. While the language we use may differ depending on the traditions teachers practices and teachings that have shaped our journeys we find in common generally a search for who we truly are our true nature and to bring the peace and compassion born of that search into the greater world of which we area part. If you wish to share or if you seek support or if you simply want to say hello please do as this space is for you. His Holiness the Dalai Lama says the key to finding happiness is first finding peace of mind. In this short video he outlines how inner peace is derailed by destructive emotions.  He outlines several things we must do do calm and dismiss destructive thinking.  I find music a big help in calming the mind.  To qualify the music must be quiet and calming itself if it is to calm the “monkey-mind” all full of clutter and distractions.  The music is instrumental preferably so I don’t have to listen to someone else’s cluttered mind in the form of lyrics.  We often keep the Pandora channel on the radio which is especially helpful for sleep.  A couple of songs from Pandora are uniquely calming for me. 2002 is a family band.  Husband wife and teenage daughter. Very simple with piano guitar keyboard and occasionally a harp. Almost all their music is conducive to helping find inner peace.  I especially like Michael Whalen a talented composer and pianist. Two As One is especially haunting in its simple beauty. This melody is calming for my own brain clutter.  Nemaste Peace this day and every day.  Take this time to sit and quietly take in your surroundings in a comfortable place.  Do not dwell on thoughts that enter your mind for long as the need to empty the mind while sitting is what is to be realized all the while concentrating on your breath:  Breath in and exhale out and truly realize the moment of this time that is just for you it is your place your time you are at home. This is an open thread. Please add your thoughts meditations and reflections as you wish.  *Attribution: Creator of Dkos Sangha Weekly Thread Brother “davehouck”.
