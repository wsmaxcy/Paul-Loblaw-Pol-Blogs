L, Capitol Hill Rioter Wore ‘I Was There’ T-Shirt When Arrested, Ed Scarce, 2021-03-29, You might remember Garrett Miller as the one who threatened to assassinate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because he just wanted "to incriminate myself a little LOL." Well it seems he's not a genius as according to the court filing today where he all but confessed by his apparel choice when the FBI showed up at his doorstep back in January. Source: Associated Press Garret Miller didn’t speak to the law enforcement officers who arrested him on charges he stormed the U.S. Capitol in January but the T-shirt he was wearing at his Dallas home that day sent a clear and possibly incriminating message. Miller’s shirt had a photograph of former President Donald Trump and it said “Take America Back” and “I Was There Washington D.C. January 6 2021” federal prosecutors noted in a court filing Monday. Prosecutors are urging a judge to keep Miller jailed while he awaits trial on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 riots in the nation’s capital. On a recorded call immediately after his arrest Miller told his mother “I don’t feel that I’ve done anything wrong and now I’m being locked up” according to prosecutors.
