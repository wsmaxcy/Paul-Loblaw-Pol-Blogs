L, Morning Open Thread.  Independence depends on Dependence., funningforrestforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-07-03, No one is born independent.  We’re dependent on others to one degree or another for our survival from the moment of birth onward and any independence we may claim is necessarily a qualified independence.  Since tomorrow is Independence Day here in the good ol’ U.S. of A. let’s ponder dependence a bit.  In the past three years I’ve come to learn more about what it means to be highly dependent on someone else but in this case there is someone who has come to be highly dependent on me and will in all probability remain so for the rest of his days.  That could mean many years into the future and that means I’ve got a lot more learning ahead of me.  This is a good thing.

For those here at MOT who may not be aware my apartment mate Rick had a debilitating stroke back in the fall of 2016 although I didn’t learn of it until the spring of 2018.  Rick and I go back as close friends since 2005 when I first met him through a chance encounter.  Across the intervening years we have done a lot of things together but had always lived our separate lives sometimes in the same town and at other times distant and out of communication.  That all changed in 2018 when I returned here to my home town for what I thought would be only a relatively short visit with Rick.  That’s when I found out he had had a stroke and as it turned out wasn’t living in the easiest of circumstances.  In fact he was rather hard up but reluctant to admit it being very independent-minded.  Cussed stubborn at times to be frank.  I could see he needed help to be able to maintain what independence he still had. For a couple of years prior to his stroke Rick was living on a piece of property he had inherited from his parents an acre of land in a remote hamlet a few miles out of Quincy CA where we now live.  The problem was that this property of his was completely undeveloped: no house no electricity no running water no sewer.  He was living in a small fifth-wheel travel trailer also an inheritance from his parents.  Before his stroke this was no big deal for him from his point of view; although he was no longer able to drive (D.U.I. no driver’s license like me) he got around with no problem was quite physically fit and would frequently walk the sixteen mile round trip into Quincy and back for small shopping and other sundry needs.  He had good neighbors to help him with transportation on occasion like when he needed to get his propane bottles refilled and everything in the trailer worked o.k. so he had a stove and oven for cooking battery power for some lighting and a snug roof over his head.  It was primitive but that was the way he liked it.  He was his own man came and went as he pleased had a small income from Social Security paid no rent other than yearly property taxes and for the most part paid no bills.  What he did have but didn’t realize was high blood pressure and that’s what caused his stroke. Upon my returning to visit him in April of 2018 I could see that his living position was no longer tenable.  Simply walking had become very difficult for him.  As a dear friend of mine I resolved that there was no way I could just stand by and let him struggle through another winter on his own in that tiny travel trailer of his.  Although the furnace worked it used so much propane that he couldn’t afford to use it.  I feared for his life.  He had been using the oven just to keep the trailer barely above freezing inside.  It certainly wasn’t in my plans but plans change as needs must so Rick and I went to work together and finally with a great deal of assistance from the Veteran’s Administration in November of 2018 we moved into this apartment. Since then Rick’s ability to walk has worsened somewhat.  He has very limited mobility in his left leg.  He does o.k. inside but if he needs to get out and go any distance he has to use an electric scooter (provided by again and with no bounds of thanks to the V.A.).  In a nutshell I have become his full time care provider and I consider that a privilege and an honor.  I do all the cooking and cleaning and shopping and bill paying and love it for this provides him with independence of mind free from having to worry about those niggling and cumbersome aspects of daily life.  Rick may be dependent upon me but I have become dependent upon him also because taking care of him provides me with a very satisfying purpose in life.  And I know that if our roles were reversed he would do the same for me.  Albeit I’m not sure I’d care for his cooking; that boy could burn water. With his full permission Rick says howdy!
