C, A few things to think about part two, markvol, 2020-11-07, “Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security.” “Light and transient causes” is what always catches my eye. We have lived through so many light and transient causes that have upset the foundation to the point that they add up to something more. They are frustrations incremental transgressions that seem to never stop on their way to destroy what we once considered sacred. It is our complacency that allows it to fester. How did that replace living and respecting all those who wished to build a better life by spilling all that blood for future generations? It’s very simple. We forgot what made us. Our foundation has eroded. Every time we look around there is something that says “Live for today forget the past”. What we are witnessing right now is an extension of that complacency. This election being the beast that we allowed to fester for decades maybe centuries has become the culmination of the sum of all past transgressions.We never fix anything when it gets out of hand. That means we have not been good and faithful stewards for those who built this house. We are disrespecting the very souls who gave us the air we breathe by not maintaining good order in our house that they built. what about our children who follow? Is this the kind of example we want them to grow up by too? An election is not “light and transient”. It is the furtherance of leadership of the greatest idea ever had and you don’t take elections so lightly. The Declaration of Independence was about our grievances against the King of England. This time the same can be said about our grievances with something much more sinister. The King assumed his power through a monarchy that has been around for centuries and we decided that it didn’t fit what we stood for and wanted life to be like. We started an idea that led to man being the ultimate expression of an individual being free to trade to deal with other individuals and to prosper. It was the ultimate escape from tyrannical rule and one to be guarded at any cost. Elections are the free expression of individuals to choose the next leader and your representatives for government. When forces interfere with the individual’s choices it is not something to take lightly. It is a crime against the foundation of our country. I always hear people say and write that “Elections have consequences”. They sure do! And when an ideology that is Hell bent on usurping that election “By any means necessary” just walks right in and takes an election hostage manipulates and commits fraud in order to replace our government what are we supposed to do about that? Sit around and talk about the next election? Is election fraud now “light and transient” to the point that we just blow it off and say something about next time when there very well may be no next time? I don’t think so. I’ve seen election fraud all my life and I am sorry to say that I have been frustrated all along but I have also been complacent like the rest. I owe my life to all those who came before me who built this great country all those who died protecting our Constitution and the ideas that came out of the Declaration of Independence and I am so sorry to have let my country down. I heard an anonymous retired Soldier say words to the effect of “I once put my life on the line for my country and I’m still willing to fight.” That hit me between the eyes because I never did that. He made me feel like a coward enough for me to say that I’m willing to be his first recruit in whatever has to follow because if men exist who never give up and believe in the founding documents which I have always believed in it’s my time to fight for everything I took for granted. I know I have a huge debt to pay to men who fought for my rights and now is that time for me or it will never be. I know that wasn’t that man’s intention but the message finally got through. That is all that matters. You do what you want but this is the time to stand up and start pushing back. I’m not calling for violence. I’m not calling to arms but I am calling on the first step and that is to back our President with everything we have and be prepared to go all the way if that is what it takes because there is an enemy doing exactly the same thing and they have evil intentions and it is they who started this problem. We need to put this to bed “By any means necessary” just like they do. I prayed for guidance last night and I continue to pray. Donald Trump was put on this Earth at this time for a reason and he deserves defending. He won that election by any reasonable and proper tradition and method. If you fail to see why I suggest you go back and read that Declaration of Independence because it is laid out why men have to defend those who began us on our journey through life. He has been doing an excellent job of defending us and them.   Quit all this light and transient talk. Deal with the life you have not some spit in the wind fantasy about things yet to come. We have a country to protect. Making suggestions about the 2022 and 2024 elections is a fools fantasy until this gets cured. Take that however you wish. So just maybe when you look at all those signatures of those who signed the Declaration of Independence you might see how a bunch of light and transient things caused them to sign it. “Light and transient” got replaced with “long train of abuses”. I wonder why? To be continued…
