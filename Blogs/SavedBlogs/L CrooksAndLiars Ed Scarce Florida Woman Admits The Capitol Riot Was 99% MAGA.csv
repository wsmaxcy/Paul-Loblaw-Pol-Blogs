This is OUR HOUSEEEE!" and "FUCK TRAITORS!" Source: WFLA TAMPA (WFLA) – A Polk County woman charged in the Jan. 6 sacking of the U.S. Capitol called the insurrection a “peaceful protest” in social media posts the day of the assault that killed five people and injured 140 others according to a court document. Corinne Lee Montoni 31 of Lakeland was arrested Tuesday morning at her home and now faces federal charges for obstruction of an official proceeding entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. She is the 25th Floridian charged in connection with the attack that disrupted a congressional hearing to certify the Electoral College count for the 2020 Presidential Election. And here's what she wrote on social media: “We broke a few windows sure but we were a peaceful protest occupying the people’s property” she wrote. Montoni added “Trump is our leader. This is not over yet.” “January 6th is the day to keep an eye on and if that doesn’t work” she wrote. “We will be back in D.C. on the 20th [the day of the Presidential inauguration] letting the world know we REJECT progressive liberalism.”  Alleged Capitol rioter Corinne Montoni becomes the latest to underscore that no antifa was not leading a false flag insurrection.“I was there. We were 99% MAGA. I didn’t see one ANTIFA. And I was inside the Capitol.” pic.twitter.com/SrOH9FOBqu — Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) March 11 2021 A Polk County woman is latest person from #Florida to be arrested in connection to Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
