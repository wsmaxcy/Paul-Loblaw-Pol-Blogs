L, Texas AG Paxton Refuses To Release Texts Emails From Sedition Rally, John Amato, 03-26-21, [Above:  From January 7 Ken Paxton was one of the speakers at the Save America Rally at the US Capitol on January 6 that led to the insurrection.] The Texas Attorney General was instrumental in whipping up  pro-Trump-supporting white supremacists militias and QAnon nutjob and had filed a frivolous lawsuit against swing states to overturn the presidential election for Donald Trump. All major newspapers in Texas are demanding Paxton release his texts and emails from January 6th even if they're stored on his personal devices and accounts. Texas law states that the public has a right to these records but so far Paxton is refusing to cooperate and release them. Paxton is already under federal investigation for allegedly abusing his office to help a campaign donor. Paxton won't release who actually paid for his trip to Washington DC on January 6.  Dallas Morning News (paywall): State ethics rules require Paxton to disclose how he funded his trip to Washington unless he used his own money. If he spent campaign funds Paxton would have to disclose that in a report due this summer. If someone else paid for him to go Paxton would likely need to report this on his financial statement. The FBI file on Paxton continues to grow. #BREAKING: Texas AG Ken Paxton refuses to release texts emails sent during pro-Trump rally & Capitol riotReminder PAXTON:⚠️Is currently indicted⚠️Is under FBI investigation⚠️SPOKE at the Jan 6 rally turned deadly riotPAXTON is on the ballot in 2022https://t.co/QrRcQF274x — Brandon Richards (@BrandonRichards) March 25 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
