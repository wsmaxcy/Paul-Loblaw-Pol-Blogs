In a 1990 interview Cortez spoke of the impact of her early adult years on her work "Being unemployed and without food can make you very sad. But you weren't the problem. The problem existed before you knew there was a problem. The problem is the system and you can organize unify and do something about the system. That's what I learned." Jayne Cortez described herself as a Jazz poet saying “Jazz isn’t just one type of music it’s an umbrella that covers the history of black people from African drumming to field hollers and the blues.” ____________________________ . . by Jayne Cortez .

These New York City Pigeonscooing in the air shaftare responsible for mestubbing my toespraining my ankleand getting sick on ammonia fumes. That pigeon roosting on the clotheslinestole my nightgownThose pigeons on the street lampmade me feel foolishwhile riding in a black carcompletely splatteredwith their grey & white poo poo. These New York City pigeonsare not calm like pigeons of Oxalá in Braziland do not croon like doves of Zimbabwe. New York City pigeons moanstrange    low    mournful    quivering cancer-like moansmixed withhungry hyena barks& gulping loss of the forest cries. New York City pigeonsare not relaxed likepigeons sunning atMarcel Duchamp swimming pool in San Francisco. New York City pigeons are not happy likepigeons standing on head of the womanselling bananas on a street corner in Johannesburg. New York City pigeonsflap viral leather fungus dust from wings into facesthen sit on steps vocalizing & waitingfor the death of humankind. New York City pigeonsare not friendly likepigeons eating flaky crescent-shaped rolls atHotel du Piémont in Paris. New York City pigeonsare not contentlike pigeonsposing for photos on armsof men in plaza of Caracas. New York City pigeonswill lounge on ledges& murmur profanity all daywill fight for fucking space inthe mating seasonshit on air conditioners& wipe their asses on windowswhile big cockroachessuck Sucrets in the dark. New York City pigeonsare not alertlike pigeonssitting quietly on bicyclesin peace memorial park of Hiroshima. New York City pigeonsroll their pearly eyesinflate their throatsand defecate on the shoulders of pedestrians. New York City pigeonshave no love for crumb-throwing pigeon lovers& no year of the pigeon is celebratedat leastnot for these New York City Pigeons. “These New York City Pigeons” from On the Imperial Highway © 2009 by Jayne Cortez – Hanging Loose Press ____________________________ . . by Jayne Cortez.

"The Oppressionists" from On the Imperial Highway © 2009 by Jayne Cortez – Hanging Loose Press ____________________________ . Trigger Warning:  This poem is about two women who were raped and killed the rapists. It also contains explicit language. In California Inez García was charged with the 1974 murder of a man who raped her. She was tried and convicted of second-degree murder. García spent two years in prison before her appeal was heard. In the retrial the jury exonerated her on grounds of self-defense. Joan Little an African American woman was also tried for murder in 1974. She killed a white prison guard in North Carolina the first woman in the U.S. to be acquitted for using deadly force to resist sexual assault. A teenage runaway she had been arrested several times for shoplifting but charges were either dismissed or she was given suspended sentences until she was arrested in North Carolina at age 21 for breaking and entering and larceny. Three months after she was sent to prison the body of a jailer was found in her cell stabbed several times with an ice pick and naked from the waist down with semen on his leg. Little was missing. She turned herself in to state authorities over a week later and said that she had killed the jailer while defending herself against sexual assault. The jailer had a history of forcing female prisoners to pay him with sex for gifts or favors as other inmates had previously stated. Angela Davis Rosa Parks and other civil rights and feminist activists spoke out in her defense helping to raise thousands of dollars for her defense fund. She was originally charged with first-degree murder which carried an automatic death sentence. Her attorneys got the charge down to second-degree murder and commissioned surveys on racial attitudes in Beaufort County where the killing took place and in Raleigh which showed there was somewhat less prejudice in Raleigh. They then successfully petitioned for a change of venue to Raleigh. .  . by Jayne Cortez.
