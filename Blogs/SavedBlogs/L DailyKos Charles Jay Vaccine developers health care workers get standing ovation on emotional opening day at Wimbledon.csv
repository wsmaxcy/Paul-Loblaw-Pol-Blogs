L, Vaccine developers health care workers get standing ovation on emotional opening day at Wimbledon, Charles Jay, 2021-06-29, So who got the biggest ovation on Wimbledon’s opening day? It wasn’t any of the tennis stars — Roger Federer Serena Williams or even Britain’s own two-time champion Andy Murray making his first appearance at the tournament since 2017. It was the people who made Wimbledon 2021 possible — the scientists who helped develop COVID-19 vaccines and staffers of the National Health Service (that’s Britain’s socialized health care system). An opening day on Centre Court with a difference...A special moment as we say thank you to those who have played such an important role in the response to COVID-19#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/16dW1kQ2nr  Last year Wimbledon had to be canceled for the first time since World War II because of the pandemic.  On Monday the stands were packed with fans for an emotional opening ceremony. The Guardian reported: When the MC announced before play that “the leaders who have developed the anti-Covid vaccine” were in the royal box the whole of Centre Court erupted in sustained applause. Pollard reacted to the ovation with this Tweet: A standing ovation today on centre court @Wimbledon for the #COVID19Vaccine. Applause for science scientists and the public who take part in research @NIHRresearch @UniofOxford pic.twitter.com/bKpiVrq1Zr  Also honored were NHS staffers who led clinical vaccine trials and medical staff members who had treated coronavirus patients. The All England Club said it would also be giving away 100 tickets a day to NHS staff London transport workers and teachers as a “Thank You” gesture. There was also a huge ovation for the late Captain Sir Tom Moore the World War II veteran who became a national inspiration by raising nearly 33 million pounds (about $46 million)  for NHS charities by walking 100 laps around his garden as he approached his 100th birthday.. He was credited with lifting the nation’s spirits during the first COVID-19 lockdown last year and his saying “Tomorrow will be a good day” trended on social media. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II last July. Moore could not be vaccinated because of other medicine he was taking for pneumonia. He died of COVID-19 in early  February. His daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore received a standing ovation as she represented him in the royal box at Wimbledon. Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker said in commentary for the BBC on Monday: “I’ve done a number of opening matches here at Wimbledon and that’s by far the most emotional start I’ve ever seen. The standing ovations for some special members here in the Royal Box and the players must feel it." Still all was not completely back to normal especially at a time when Britain is still battling COVID-19  with the more contagious delta variant causing case numbers to rise the Washington Post  reported. All ticket holders are required to show proof of COVID-10 vaccination or a negative test result taken within the previous 48 hours. Masks are required when people are not in their seats and walking around the grounds.  Seating is limited to 50 percent capacity except for the championship matches on the last two days of the tournament when a full house of 15000 will be permitted. Players must stay in designated hotels rather than in private accommodations.
