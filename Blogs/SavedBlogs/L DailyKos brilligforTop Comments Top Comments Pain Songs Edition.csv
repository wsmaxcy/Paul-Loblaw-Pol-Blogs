L, Top Comments: Pain Songs Edition, brilligforTop Comments, 2021-04-19, As regular Top Comments readers may remember my offering last week was Top Comments: Pain Scale Edition. It’s been a long week since then as my sciatic nerve and I spent a couple of days testing out that scale’s levels bouncing between 4 (my pain is not fucking around) and 8 (I am experiencing a disturbing amount of pain.  I might actually be dying.  Please help). It finally swapped this weekend to “Hey brillig let’s just pretend you are 95 years old and walking on ice. Move like you don’t want to fall and break something”.  I’m feeling a lot better today and have stopped what K1 (my-Psychology and Future School Counselor offspring) told me was Catastrophic Thinking. I do believe after PT today that I might both one day rate my back pain at a 0 and be able to make the drive to see K1 now that we’re both vaccinated sooner rather than later.  As I write with an ice pack on my back and think about my visit to the orthopedist on Thursday I give you a themed set of music in which the title or lyrics are associated with pain. I’m hoping you will share your appropriate music whether it’s lyrically appropriate or whether the simple sound of the song makes YOU hurt.  In no particular order: - Everybody Hurts — REM — and a gorgeous cover by Kelly Clarkson and P!nk - King of Pain — The Police — and my own favorite version by Alanis Morissette. - Hurt — Nine Inch Nails — and of course the utterly amazing Johnny Cash version. - Love Hurts — Boudleaux Bryant first recorded by The Everly Brothers— You may know the Nazareth or Gram Parsons/Emmylou Harris versions best. - Hurts So Good — John Mellencamp — It’s rare I’m stumped for a cover version. Consider me stumped. - Her Diamonds — Rob Thomas — References his wife’s autoimmune disease. Another song without an easily discoverable cover version. But poignant and beautiful with wife Marisol singing on the track.  - Give Me Novacaine — Green Day — You needed a ukelele cover of this right?  - Comfortably Numb — Pink Floyd — When the ice pack and anti-inflammatories kick in! Have an ethereal version by Dar Williams & Ani DiFranco.  Hop carefully over the story break for tonight’s trio of Top Comments Mojo and Pictures!

Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down. Please remember that comment inclusion in Top Comments does not constitute support or endorsement by diarist formatter Top Comments writers or DailyKos. Questions complaints or comments? Contact brillig. From Denise Oliver Velez: This evocative comment from Anakai is one I missed - memories of the first time he heard Roberta Flack's “Killing Me Softly”.  From yours truly brillig: In HalBrown's Just Sayn': We're a plywood nation despair and anger tear me apart when I read the news was this comment by the author that is the perfect counter to his diary topic itself and also was the coolest bit of news I read all day.  I KNOW I shouldn't have laughed at this thread started by Lost and Found in TheCriticalMind's Noted Norwegian COVID Conspiracy Theorist Dies of COVID.  And yet sizzzzlerz ER Doc and rightiswrong made me do it.
