L, Giant positive news for Africa- malaria vaccine hope, oldmanriver, 2021-04-23, If we could pick our heads up for a moment and look across the sea one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of all time has recently been announced.  To me this is the greatest news I could have woken up to read.  500000 children PER YEAR die in Africa of this disease and now we have a fighting chance to eradicate it.  That’s every bit as bad as COVID every single year.  We shut our country down to try to fight a disease of that magnitude.   This community is rightly concerned about people of color- well show me a more important news story to people of color around the world than this one right here.  Imagine if COVID went on unchecked for a century and we suddenly found a vaccine.  Honestly I can only imagine because I am very fortunate to live in a country that is largely free of malaria.  (Yeah we sprayed super toxic DDT all over the south to get to this point:   en.wikipedia.org/...) Anyhow here’s a hearty congratulations to science and these scientists in particular who never gave up on finding a solution. www.cnn.com/…  London (CNN)A vaccine against malaria has shown record efficacy in a Phase II trial a pre-print study released on Friday by Oxford University shows raising hopes that one of the world's most deadly diseases could be brought under control.
