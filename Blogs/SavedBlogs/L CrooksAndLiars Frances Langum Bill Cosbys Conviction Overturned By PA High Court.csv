L, Bill Cosby's Conviction Overturned By PA High Court, Frances Langum, 2021-06-30, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Celebrity has its privileges.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has overturned Bill Cosby's rape conviction because during his trial other victims were called to the stand to affirm that he did the same thing to them.   Those victims were given a day in court but the prosecutor did not charge Cosby with those crimes.  That the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said was unfair to the defendant.  Associated Press: The trial judge had allowed just one other accuser to testify at Cosby’s first trial when the jury deadlocked. However he then allowed five other accusers to testify at the retrial about their experiences with Cosby in the 1980s. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that testimony tainted the trial even though a lower appeals court had found it appropriate to show a signature pattern of drugging and molesting women. Cosby was the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era so the reversal could make prosecutors wary of calling other accusers in similar cases. The law on prior bad act testimony varies by state though and the ruling only holds sway in Pennsylvania. So the ruling determines that Cosby was informed he wouldn't be prosecuted for an assault meaning that he couldn't invoke the Fifth when being deposed for a civil complaint. Then he said incriminating things and a new DA prosecuted him for the assault. — Philip Bump (@pbump) June 30 2021 BREAKING: PA Supreme Court overturns Bill Cosby's conviction.

Epstein got one from Acosta. Cosby got his Cantor. What do Acosta and Cantor have in common? They are Republicans. — The Swede (@AverageSavant) June 30 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
