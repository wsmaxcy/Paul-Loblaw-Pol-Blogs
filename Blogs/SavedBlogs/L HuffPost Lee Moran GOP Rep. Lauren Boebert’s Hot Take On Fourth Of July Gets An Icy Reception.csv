L, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert’s Hot Take On Fourth Of July Gets An Icy Reception, Lee Moran, 2021-04-23, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) continues to confuse people with her tweets. The QAnon conspiracy theory-endorsing lawmaker ― whose recent hot takes on mass shootings April Fools’ Day and freedoms have backfired ― on Thursday attacked President Joe Biden with a post declaring he “has zero authority to cancel the 4th of July.” Joe Biden has zero authority to cancel the 4th of July. It wasn’t clear what sparked Boebert’s bluster. Some commenters speculated she was railing against coronavirus restrictions and their possible continuation later into the year. Biden on Wednesday suggested that “to celebrate our independence from this virus on July 4th with family and friends in small groups we still have more to do in the months of May and June. We all need to mask up until the number of cases goes down until everyone has a chance to get their shot.” Others thought Boebert was simply playing up the right-wing talking point decrying Democrats for “taking away” freedoms. The post did galvanize some of her supporters. But mostly it was met with mockery: I heard he's cancelling Christmas too. Yeh he does we’re gonna go right from July 3 to July 5 on the calendar by imperial decree and there’s nothing you can do about it 🙄 Thanks for the update.  Won't have to edit my calendar. Yeah it'd be kinda weird to go from July 3rd to July 5th.  They'd have to reprint all of the calendars too. not only did he cancel the fourth he canceled christmas and he extended black history month to be black history century https://t.co/50A6mEFqZl Do you have a big bag of stupid that you just draw tweets out of whenever you're feeling like people aren't looking at you enough? https://t.co/610JBSEMAQ Absolutely correct.  Thanks for mentioning this. I'm lost cancel the 4th? Also Joe Biden has zero authority to chase hobbits while riding a Taun-Taun through the streets of Whoville. https://t.co/j8rkhFvGR3 It'll still be there right between the 3rd and 5th of July Qaren Didn't you try cancel an Inauguration? July 4 still appears on all of our household calendars—electronic and paper.🤷‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/EqBDeLhLv3
