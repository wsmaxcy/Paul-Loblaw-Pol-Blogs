L, Andrew Yang spoke at Stonewall Democratic Club in NY to pick up endorsements but did not do so well, CameronProf, 2021-04-22, If you are not familiar with NY politics the Stonewall Club is a key issue in obtaining their support to get out the gay vote. In this mission he failed. He wanted to talk about Pride Parades and reopening gay bars...they wanted more serious discussions on more important topics...which he did not seem willing to be able to do. You can read more about this meeting here I am not in NY but after reading about his appearance I became irate as well. Look if he does get the final endorsement for mayor I am sure that most gay folk will vote for him but it will not be a heart-felt vote. Yang is running for mayor of New York and due to name recognition he is in front of the pack. But if you look at the support beyond the numbers you might be more weary of his support and ability to pull off a primary victory: While Mr. Yang has a consistent lead in the polls and has acquired a handful of endorsements from elected officials he has generally failed to win significant support from New York City institutions including labor unions and the Stonewall Club which did not endorse him. Why? looking at his appearance at Stonewall shows a powerful reason:   Yet Mr. Yang’s appearance struck those members as pandering and tone deaf according to interviews a video and a copy of the comments that unfolded during the virtual meeting.  I admit I am not a Yang fan but I do not dislike him He never won me over in the huge Democratic primary debates but of course I would have voted for him had he won.  But when I hear someone talking to me in the words that he used I would be upset. He pandered as no one ever pandered before:  “I genuinely do love you and your community” he said according to a partial recording of the remarks describing his affection for the L.G.B.T.Q. community. “You’re so human and beautiful. You make New York City special. I have no idea how we ever lose to the Republicans given that you all are frankly in like leadership roles all over the Democratic Party.” “We have like this incredible secret weapon” he added. “It’s not even secret. It’s like we should win everything because we have you all.”  Egads… I can hear the sap falling from the tree as he speaks. I am just shocked he did not say some of his best friends were gay and he named his favorite dog “gay: since we are so golly-gee awsome.  Look I appreciate the kidn words. It is nice to hear people coming to our community and seeking our support. But using such language and wanting to talk about overall minor issues that impact the gay community is another thing.  Look at individual comments by members of the Club who were there:   Multiple participants described Mr. Yang’s remarks as offensive saying that members of the club who raised policy issues found his mention of gay bars off-putting. “Gay gay gay. Wow” one person wrote in the chat accompanying the forum which was later shared with The New York Times. “More to us than just that.”  To Harris Doran a club member and filmmaker Mr. Yang’s insistence on referring to members as “your community” particularly stung. “He kept calling us ‘Your community’ like we were aliens” Mr. Doran said.  Ms. Christ said members were offended that Mr. Yang chose to focus on bars parades and his gay staff members. “Those are not the substantive issues that our membership cares about and it came off poorly” Ms. Christ said. Look it is not so hard. Don’t pander to us don’t treat us like alien French poodles. Know what issues are impacting our community don’t just make assumptions about what we care about.
