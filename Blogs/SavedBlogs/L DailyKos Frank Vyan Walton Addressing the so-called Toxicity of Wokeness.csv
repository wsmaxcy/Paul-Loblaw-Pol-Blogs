L, Addressing the so-called Toxicity of Wokeness, Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-05-10, We are told these days that “wokeness” is a problem.  That being aware of gender and identity is crossing a bridge too far.  None of us need to pay any attention to identity politics because all the problems of racial and gender strife have already been solved. Yep it's all fixed now thank you very much. Somehow we did it in our sleep.  Poof.  It's all gone. We don't need to do any movies or films which featured female lead characters we don't need to have films with ethnic minorities.  We certainly don't need to have them going after “The Man” and being all uppity and bitter. Pfft. Woke Feminism is not necessary.  It's an anachronism.  It's archiac and counter-productive.  There’s no need to rail against the patriarchy any more.  Those days are all gone it's all over.  People don't need to see female-led movies they don’t want them they don't like them. “Get Woke Go Broke!” Right? Just to show how sloppily this video is put together they showed an array of female-led movies with low audience scores but among them is Ghostbusters II from 1989 which includes the original all-male cast. What they wanted to show was the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot which featured a female cast and had a score of 74 (Critics) and 49 (Audience).  It also features Star Wars: The Last Jedi when in reality the first Star Wars movie with a female lead was Star Wars: The Force Awakens which had a score of 93 (Critics) and 86 (Audience).  Another contrast would be Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker which had a weak critic score of 51 and an audience score of 86 so the premise they're trying to present that all female-led movies bust at the box office is false on its face.  It's not nearly that simple. If we go by gross receipts the movies they initially show break down like this: Captain Marvel         $426 Million (Domestic)  $1.1 Billion (International) Ghostbusters II         $112 Million (Domestic) $215 Million (International) Last Jedi                      $620 Million (Domestic) $1.3 Billion (International) Mulan (2020)             $66 Million (Total) Batwoman (S1)           N/A Dr. Who (S12)             N/A --------------— Here are several additional relevant movies which they didn’t include: Force Awakens         $936 Million (Domestic) $2.0 Billion (International) Rise of Skywalker     $515 Million (Domestic) $1.0 Billion (International) Ghostbusers (2016) $128 Million (Domestic) $229 Million (International) Mulan (1998)            $120 Million (Domestic) $304 Million (International) Alita:Battle Angel     $85  Million (Domestic)  $404 Million (International) Wonder Woman       $412 Million (Domestic) $822 Million (International) The narrative that woke movies aren't successful in the box office is simply not true.  The three Star Wars sequel movies all do good business which gradually tapers off but that is entirely normal.  Many of those who complain about woke films use the example of Alita: Battle Angel as an unwoke movie with a female protagonist but that movie really didn't do all that well in the US. The Ghostbusters female reboot actually did about as well as Ghostbusters II  back in 1989.  Captain Marvel with Brie Larson did great.  Even if you argue the Captain Marvel did well only because it was a lead in to Avengers: Endgame  that was also true of Ant Man and the Wasp which was a known property and that film only did $216 Million (Domestic) and $622 (International) - far less than Captain Marvel. The video drags on Commander Holdo from Last Jedi when in reality the character’s name was Admiral Holdo and what exactly did she do wrong other than not trust Poe Dameron while they were being mysteriously tracked by the enemy with a potential traitor on board? Meanwhile he ultimately fostered a secret mission without authorization that failed and staged a coup all of which showed that he wasn't trustworthy. Holdo was not wrong to give him the stiff arm. The video argues that the female heroes that should be heralded for their “unwokeness" include Black Widow Rita Vertaski (Edge of Tomorrow) Zoe (Firefly) Eowyn (LOTR) and Wonder Woman while walking into no man's land.  They simply show up they don’t whine about being women and they kick ass. Except that Eowyn did have to take a back seat hide and pretend to be male in order to join the fight just as Mulan did.  She was ridiculed and belittled for being female just as Carol Danvers was in the 1990's Air Force.  So again the examples don't really fit the narrative. Their ability is apparent but oh so understated. So is their ability obvious or is it hidden which is it? I think what they may mean is their ability is shown not told.  But then again we weren't “told” about Captain Marvel’s full strength we were shown. Their gender is never brought up as a justification excuse or any kind of complaint. So they're women who just don't talk about being women?  Is that the magic key be female but don't tell us about it? I think we know. Seriously. But then we finally get down to brass tacks. My favorite thing about them is that they don't hate men. They don't feel threatened or put upon by the men around them Instead they form bonds with men and work with them shoulder to shoulder as equals. Their power is not diminished in comparison.  They're not here to destroy the patriarchy.  They’re here to do what’s right. Yeah but what if doing what’s right is to destroy the patriarchy as we see in The Handmaiden's Tale?   Interesting how Offred/June played by Elizabeth Moss is entirely left off this list of the woke/unwoke. Destroying the Patriarchy is at the core of the issue here.  The characters praised here don't challenge men and they don't challenge male power they don't upset the apple cart - they don’t exist to upset the “order of things.”  They aren’t here to “replace” men and put them in the back of the bus. They aren't a threat to maleness. The complaints about wokeness aren’t attacks on women in positions of power it really is a complaint that men are being removed from positions of power.  Men are being demoted diminished. Replaced. The real complaint about Holdo is that she puts down Poe. Odd that this criticism isn't aimed at General Leah Organa who had just demoted Poe for getting their fleet of ships blown up in a pointless pyrrhic victory. Hmph. The real complaint about Batwoman or the new Dr. Who is that they seem like a needless gender swap although I think the bigger problem is really with weak storytelling and lame uninteresting villains none of which has anything to do with the gender of the lead character. Charlie’s Angels Director Elizabeth Banks: My real plea is for men to have enough empathy to see movies starring women.  I've been asked to go see movies starring men for my entire life and happily I’ve done so and I don't know why men don't return the fucking favor. The video argues that this is Elizabeth being "entitled.”  Really?  Any meaningful analysis of gender representation in films is going to absolutely back up with what Elizabeth Banks said. Out of all the movies you have watched in you life have you ever noticed a majority of the leading roles were male? Although representation of female characters in movies is improving there are 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Not only do women have fewer leading roles but there are fewer female movie directors/producers and the difference in salary compared to men is way less depending on their age. On top of that women’s acting careers in the movie industry depend on whether or not they maintain the “Hollywood” look by staying skinny and portraying a youthful appearance. Men account for 88% of the protagonist in the top 100 highest grossing domestic films of 2014 while women only account for 12% of the protagonist in the top 100 highest grossing domestic films in 2014. Such films include; American Sniper The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1 Guardians of the Galaxy Captain America: The Winter Soldier The LEGO Movie 22 Jump Street and many more other well known films.  Men also account for 71% of major characters and 70% of all speaking characters  the percentages are from a study done in 2013. As you can see men are dominating the film industry. Leading men roles are also very dominated by white men over any other race.  Men over 40 also account for 53% of characters. There are more older men in films than there are younger men in films. The older a man gets in the film industry the more valuable they become. Men also are typically always older than women on TV and in films. Most women on TV and in films are under 40. Another fact is that while men continue to age in movies and TV their love interest typically stay the same age. For example Denzel Washington is about 60 while his love interest on TV and movies continue to stay 35 years and younger. That also goes for a lot of actors as well. Brie Larson brought this up.  She was right. She brought reciepts. Female-led directed and written films are absolutely in the minority.  It is interesting that so many people are so energetically concerned that the amount of white male representation in film and TV just might dip from 70% to 69% that they have to go on extended rants about the “dangers” of wokeness as if there was any real threat to actual real men in this world. The video complains that women like Batwoman and Dr. Who are just waltzing into the roles of men "without earning it” when they absolutely have earned it Ruby Rose's character has been training and pushing her body to peak perfection for more than a decade when we first meet her. She’s not some random interloper. It complains that some of these women are driven by bitterness vengeance and anger. Uh and after almost 100 years of movies and films that mostly focus on men you seriously don't think some of that bitterness is fucking earned?  Of course it is.  It absolutely is. This antogonistic behavior assumes that we just hand over success to men simply for being men. Yep.  As a man my entire life I know damn well that's absolutely true. That assumes no male-led movie ever does badly and no male character is ever criticized or disliked. Now they're just being stupid.  Men disproportionately get roles and positions they don't always deserve — but that doesn’t mean they always succeed in them.  They get chance after chance after chance to fail over and over again.   I mean exactly why does Ian Zerling still have a fucking acting career? I'm sure he’s a nice guy but what is he on Sharknado #6 by now? (Actually Yes) Women and minorities get one chance and they better not fuck it up. Or else. Success needs to be earned but woke feminism thinks that if you don't like these characters "You are sexist.” You might be sexist but not sexist against women - you might be sexist in favor of men you feel are being disrespected. It's still sexism. Another mistake of woke feminism is there is no legitimate criticism. No any criticism of these characters is borne out of bitter jealousy and a deep desire to keep women down. If that criticism is how a male character could have done it better without "bitterness” — then no that's not legitimate criticism. That’s bullshit. Another mistake that woke feminism makes it's unshakeable belief that it is saving society. That men would bigoted toxic fools if women weren't putting them in their place and women would be helpless knitting by the fire and weeping wondering when the men would be home. Obviously this gal has not seen Little Women. Or Fried Green Tomatoes. Yes some men are toxic.  Terminally so.  Yes that toxicity should be challenged.  It has to be challenged. That there would be no role models without woke feminism. You need to see exactly yourself on screen someone who has your skin color your background in order to connect with them. Yes actually - that is how role models work.  People who largely see themselves all the time have no appreciation of this. Nichelle Nichols on Star Trek in 1968 was a big deal.  Avery Brooks as Commander Sisko on Deep Space Nine was a big deal. Captain Katheryn Janeway was a big deal and Captain Michael Burnham now on Star Trek: Discovery is definitely a big deal.  All of these characters have opened up people's minds they've shown what’s possible and what could potentially happen - someday in the future. It matters that now Captain America is a Black Man.  Just look at how people reacted to Woke Cap for the first time. Look at how Obama reacted to Sam Wilson as Captain America. Can someone appreciate a hero with a different gender different orientation and background?  Well sure we’ve all been identifying with white cis-gendered males on screen for a century now — his name used to John Wayne (180 films) then it was Clint Eastwood (72 films) and then Tom Cruise (51 films) —  but it doesn't hurt to have a few more choices. Like Elizabeth said - it's time to return the fucking favor. Of course there are some who are triggered. Woke movies and shows don't have to put down white men in order to build up others. I agree that's a cheap move it's lazy. It's not necessary.  I agree that it happens sometimes that may be unfortunate but I haven't yet seen an apology for Steppin Fetchit Gone with the Wind Birth of a Nation or Song of the South so I’m gonna play the tiniest possible violin of regret and sympathy over that.  Boo fucking Hoo.  I think the totality of male whiteness can take an occasional jab every now and then. We're still hundreds of movies behind. I have a friend who is an AAPI actor his name is Archie Kao and he was featured regularly on the show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He was born in Washington DC had previously played a Power Ranger and had been name one of People Magazine’s “Sexist Men Alive” but his last major American role was as the technical support Officer on the first season of Chicago PD.  At the end of the season his character was strangely killed off by the Internal Affairs Officer who been trying to get him to cooperate with sharing inside information on his boss.  He was so deeply disrespected on that show that they didn't even reveal his character’s first name until after he had already been killed off screen. I haven't watched an episode of Chicago PD since.   During the last seven years he's been appearing in TV series in Taiwan and Beijing because there simply aren't enough roles in all of American TV and movies for more than one AAPI actor at a time.  Right now that actor is John Cho.  There’s no more room for anyone else. I haven't seen him in years. Trying to change the balance of representation in movies and TV is an expression of how we understand ourselves and each other. It is going through a transition we are treading in new and difficult waters here — sometimes people have made mistakes.  Sometimes they've done a poor job and had some weak writing and sometimes not. Sometimes they deserve to be criticized however chasing Kelly Marie Tran completely off the internet for daring to exist is not a good look. As Sam/Cap says - we need to do better.  Here's a total unbiased unspoiled and unphased review of Captain Marvel.  It is interesting how the movie plays for someone without an agenda.
