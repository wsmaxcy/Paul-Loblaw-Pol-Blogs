L, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert Self-Owns With Conspiratorial Constitution Tweet, Lee Moran, 2021-04-27, Twitter users had little time for Rep. Lauren Boebert’s (R-Colo.) latest conspiratorial post. On Monday the QAnon conspiracy theory-endorsing lawmaker attempted to rally her supporters with this warning about the Constitution being under threat: The people who wrote the Constitution were much smarter than the ones trying to abolish it. Boebert’s hot takes on mass shootings the Fourth Of July freedom and voting have all been ratioed in recent weeks. And the overwhelming majority of commenters on her latest tweet considered it another damning self-own: We are talking about Trump and the MAGAs right? As a freethinking person who lives in 2021 not 1776 I think times have changed enough to warrant a retooling of our guiding principles. The people who wrote the constitution viewed women as property owned slaves and couldn’t even come close to imagining what an iPhone is. Times have changed. I'm concerned you don't fully understand the irony in this statement coming from you. Thank you for admitting that. Bless your heart. They owned slaves and wouldn't let women vote.Readjust your critique. The irony of this post. And its only Monday They were so smart they put in a system so that the document could be changed and updated to suit future times hence amendments. No one is trying to abolish anything. #GQP Wow. You really set that one up for us to spike it Laur. “Stupidest Tweet Award 2021” Nominee 👏👏👏 This brainiac doesn't get that she wouldn't be allowed in Congress when the Constitution was written. https://t.co/nAjqgkaMoe The only thing I have to recognize from Qbert is consistency she is always dumb You're exhausting. Really a broken record. Spinning out bull shit day after day. Read a book or the Constitution. https://t.co/GB3rKQP5uG
