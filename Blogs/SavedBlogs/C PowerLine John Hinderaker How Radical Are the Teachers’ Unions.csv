C, How Radical Are the Teachers’ Unions?, John Hinderaker, 2021-07-02, America’s teachers’ unions are the country’s single most malign influence. They do more to promote leftist extremism and do it more effectively than anyone else. The teachers’ unions dominate the schools of education from which most teachers come and they control school board elections in most districts. In effect they run the public schools which is the main reason why the public schools are so bad. How radical are they? The National Education Association boasts that it is not just the largest teachers’ union but the biggest labor union in the U.S. One of the NEA’s top priorities is promoting the teaching of Critical Race Theory in the public schools. The NEA is currently holding its annual meeting. This is Item 39 of New Business: The NEA will with guidance on implementation from the NEA president and chairs of the Ethnic Minority Affairs Caucuses: A. Share and publicize through existing channels information already available on critical race theory (CRT) — what it is and what it is not; have a team of staffers for members who want to learn more and fight back against anti-CRT rhetoric; and share information with other NEA members as well as their community members. B. Provide an already-created in-depth study that critiques empire white supremacy anti-Blackness anti-Indigeneity racism patriarchy cisheteropatriarchy capitalism ableism anthropocentrism and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society and that we oppose attempts to ban critical race theory and/or The 1619 Project. C. Publicly (through existing media) convey its support for the accurate and honest teaching of social studies topics including truthful and age-appropriate accountings of unpleasant aspects of American history such as slavery and the oppression and discrimination of Indigenous Black Brown and other peoples of color as well as the continued impact this history has on our current society. The Association will further convey that in teaching these topics it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society including critical race theory. D. Join with Black Lives Matter at School and the Zinn Education Project to call for a rally this year on October 14—George Floyd’s birthday—as a national day of action to teach lessons about structural racism and oppression—even in places where it is illegal and requires civil disobedience. Followed by additional days of action that recognize and honor lives taken such as Breonna Taylor Philando Castile and others. The National Education Association shall publicize these National Days of Action to all its members including in NEA Today. E. Conduct a listening tour that will educate members on the tools and resources needed to defend honesty in education including but not limited to tools like CRT. F. Commit President Becky Pringle to make public statements across all lines of media that support racial honesty in education including but not limited to critical race theory. The proposal carries with it a $343580 appropriation to promote CRT and undermine America. Will it pass? I assume so. In any event it certainly reflects the attitudes of the NEA and the large majority of its members. My organization works hard to combat CRT and to improve the public schools but in many areas it probably is parental malpractice to put one’s children in the hands of the extremists who now dominate public education. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
