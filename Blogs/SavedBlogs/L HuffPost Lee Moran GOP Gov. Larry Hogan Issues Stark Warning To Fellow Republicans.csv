L, GOP Gov. Larry Hogan Issues Stark Warning To Fellow Republicans, Lee Moran, 2021-04-27, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called out the “pure lunacy” of the GOP and warned what will happen if his party continues the “failed path” paved by ex-President Donald Trump. On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Lead” host Jake Tapper referred to the example of a conspiracy theorist spewing baseless claims about the murder of George Floyd and COVID-19 at a Minnesota county Republican event. “I keep hoping for your party to rejoin us on planet earth ― what’s going on?” Tapper asked Hogan. Hogan a frequent Trump critic who has condemned Republicans’ refusal to accept President Joe Biden won the 2020 election replied: “Well I keep hoping that as well. I can’t really explain what’s going on Jake. I mean it’s just pure lunacy. The kind of thing I’ve been speaking out against ever since President Trump was elected. But this has gotten just out of hand.” Then came the warning: “Look we’re not going to win elections in the future we’re not going to be a majority party we’re not going to win back the Senate the House or the White House if we continue to go down this crazy road of conspiracy theories and lies. I mean we’ve got to get back to reality.” Watch the video here:
