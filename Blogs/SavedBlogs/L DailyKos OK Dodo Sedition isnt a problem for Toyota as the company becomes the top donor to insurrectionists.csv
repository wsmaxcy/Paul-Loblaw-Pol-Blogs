L, Sedition isn't a problem for Toyota as the company becomes the top donor to insurrectionists, OK Dodo, 2021-06-27, Toyota is going places even if that means getting insurrectionist GQP members on board. In fact the prolific Japanese automaker is the top donor to Republican congress members who objected to the 2020 election results where Joe Biden won instead. According to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington Toyota made donations to 37 members with the donations resulting in a grand total of $55000; these 37 form 25 per cent of the members that voted to nullify President Joe Biden’s win after the insurrection riot on the 6th of January. As a matter of fact Toyota’s $55000 donation to insurrectionists is more than even donations from military contractor Cubic Corp and the infamous Koch Industries.  Toyota is the no. 1 donor to Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 election results — by farhttps://t.co/6zPD5LNpnR pic.twitter.com/coBWOnORoa  Many are calling for a boycott of Toyota ever since it was revealed that the company gave $1000 to West Virginia Republican Alex Mooney per data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The fact that the donation made on February 4th did not sit well for loads of consumers even if some strange optimist can make the connection to the Toyota factory being in Buffalo West Virginia which is indeed located in Alex Mooney’s district (West Virginia 2nd). But this donation strongly rebukes Toyota’s prior commitment to not donate to illiberal lawmakers.  The two recent companies that broke their pledge to halt donations to seditionists are @Toyota and @JetBlue.Tag and tell them how you feel about that.  Yo @Toyota: I am a happy owner of a Toyota 4Runner.I cannot in good conscience make any more purchases from your company knowing you are the no. 1 donor to Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 election.Fix this or I will NEVER purchase another Toyota product. https://t.co/XOzDkwUKif  Despite gradually growing outcries from liberals and progressives Toyota will continue to donate to any politician even if they are blatantly anti-democratic. The company issued a statement: "We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification."  Toyota: “We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification”You’re $hitting us right? Fundamentally this is it. You’re either for democracy or for fascism. For truth or for lies.There is no in between.  Well even if Democrats financially boycott Toyota still watch your back Elon Musk because Toyota will continue to bring the big bucks for GQPers!  Hard to make Fords and Chevys during a civil war. Well played Toyota https://t.co/Ta7sUR2ubk
