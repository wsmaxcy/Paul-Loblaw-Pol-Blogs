L, Anti-COVID Vaxxers Are Tea Party 2.0, John Amato, 2021-06-11, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  During his first town-hall Rep. Huffman (CA-2) held this year anti-COVID restriction whacks shouted at him while he was answering questions from people in his district. KSRO reports that many of these MAGA dirt bags carried "signs included slogans like 'Jab mandate is fascist' and 'My body my choice.'  Some were even wearing MAGA hats showing support for former President Trump." The Congressman said this on Facebook: “Outside of the January 6th insurrection this might be the ugliest most disgraceful spectacle I’ve ever seen.” Why is there a nudist with a ferret sign. I’m confused pic.twitter.com/b8wDOy6Jh7 — K.C (@fogcity41510) June 9 2021 Rep. Huffman's voting record gets a solid A from Progressive Punch's scorecard and has been excellent representing his constituents.  I fear this will be the new trend from these miscreants as the country slowly reopens because of the Biden Administration's highly successful vaccination plans. The Beltway media refused to call out the racist evangelicals that made up the tea party as soon as Obama was elected and their behavior during the summer of 2009 was reprehensible and violent.   Is the summer of 2021 going to be the same way? Count on it. The only difference is that this will be the summer of white supremacy and anti-vaccine nonsense instead of health care protests. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
