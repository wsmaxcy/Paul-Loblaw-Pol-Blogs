L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 5/4/2021: Just a Spring Clean for the May Queen, belinda ridgewoodforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-05-04,  Good evening Kibitzers! The weather has been all over the place here but I think we’re finally done with freezing and then bouncing back and we’re on to getting summertime-hot and then bouncing back. So I suppose it’s time to get out and buy some flowers for my porch planters before all the good stuff is gone. I think I got onto time-lapse YouTubes of flowers blooming because I had a DonorsChoose project in the Inoculation Project about germinating seeds and I needed a bean-sprouting video to illustrate it. So I’ve been accumulating this little flower collection and I think the beginning of May when the April showers have done what they can is the right time to clear them out of my “liked videos” queue and array them in here.  If you hate flowers there’s some music and if you hate that too come down and chat with us — we’re like a peanut-butter sandwich when the dining hall is serving something too weird. And since it is also Star Wars Day May the fourth be with you always. National Geographic did a nice job with this one — with clever editing they’ve made it feel like one long tracking shot of a spring garden opening.   [4:24] This one has some dahlias which have a lot of petals. I love the effect of wave after wave of petals bursting out of the center and moving outward sort of like fireworks.   [2:40] The wildflowers in this one look European — I know I’ve seen ones like them in Marko the Werelynx’s pictures of what grows in the woods around Prague. There are poppies too one of my favorites. And the fungus spraying spores all over at the end is pretty cool.   [5:13] This one is a bit different — it follows along with some of the flowers until they wilt and crumple. Another difference is the music: they use popular songs the first one of which is Besame. (As you may know our Besame is a botanist so that works out.)   [10:07] The last two flower collections are in honor of KTK founders remembrance and nomandates. Obviously this cactus flowers one is for nomandates since she is a cactus.   [4:20] This woman has managed to choreograph the opening flowers (with occasional ballet companies making cameo appearances) to Waltz of the Flowers. Very graceful like our remembrance.   [7:45] Someone had to sing April Showers today and I picked very young Mel Tormé. This comes from a live performance with the Page Cavanaugh Trio somewhere between 1944 and 1947 as best I can tell. That would make Mr. Tormé somewhere between 19 and 22 here. He started singing professionally when he was four so you can’t tell his age by the level of polish in evidence. Crappy video quality and quite an abrupt end to the clip but it was the longest segment of this I could find.   [2:48] There aren’t so many songs about May but it gets dragged into some of the April songs. (Or maybe I’m just not thinking of them. March and May have the same googling issue which is that they’re very ambiguous words.)   [2:24] It really is just a spring clean for the May Queen.   [10:40] I thought we needed a song about flowers too. This one is not your average flower song.   [4:22] Today’s Political and Other Short Subjects: The Meidas Touch has a couple of things this week. This one is about the voices that radicalize their listeners.   [1:30] And then there’s lyin’ sleepy Ted.   [0:56] Colbert offers the GOP an attack ad since they seem to be short of ideas.   [1:32] Beau shares some perspective on the scrunch-faced fear baboon’s views about children in masks.  [6:24] Finally for Cinco de Mayo feel free to join the T-rex party!   [0:41] Stay safe!  💙💙💙💙💙 The Democracy Docket website founded by formidable our-side attorney Marc Elias carries breaking news about current election law more in-depth articles and always information plus all available legal documents (as PDFs) about every active election law case. Marc Elias and Democracy Docket on Twitter are good sources of current news about election law including all the voter-suppression crap coming up. You can subscribe to the Democracy Docket email newsletter here to get the latest updates. Democracy Docket also has a YouTube channel. The Republican attack on voting and undermining of democracy is the most under-covered story in America today. I fear that 50 years from now it will be what this period is most remembered for and yet most of the media treats it as a both-sides political dispute.   We have come to the point where Chef José Andrés’ worldwide relief organization is so ubiquitous that I’m just giving it its own box here. I can’t even link all the places they’re working. They’re feeding people who need meals wherever they find them for whatever reason and by whatever means including supporting local restaurants by contracting with them for meals. Pretty much every tab at that website will tell you something amazing. You can always donate or volunteer at their website but it may not be up on the very latest news. For that check Twitter for Chef Andrés and for World Central Kitchen. Please see Denise Oliver Velez’s diary for information on and ways to help the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and the nearby islands where people are currently threatened by a dangerous volcanic eruption. It has been 1322 DAYS SINCE HURRICANE MARIA MADE LANDFALL IN PUERTO RICO ON SEPTEMBER 20 2017. As federal money begins to flow so many problems have built up due to various natural disasters drought Covid as a pandemic and with its economic impacts it’s not the case that a big pile of cash is just going to fix everything there. At the root of the problem is racism; what a surprise. It’s easy for wealthy colonizers to loot a place when there aren’t many people who care what happens there. It’s… kind of a pattern. Since no one can snap their fingers and declare the problem solved this box is now tracking reports from Denise Oliver-Velez. To learn more about what’s going on there her Twitter feed and Daily Kos comments are good starting points. 1321 days post Maria activists in Puerto Rico take to the streets (again) to protest declaring a State of Emergency for Gender Violence (Estado de Emergencia por Violencia de Género). Hey mainland journalists how about following Colectiva Feminista @ColeFeminista   Missing some past entry? My past diaries list where the older purple boxes still live. NEW: The CDC’s guidance page for mask wearing. Also this Sunday Today segment explores the current state of restrictions and safety measures. NEW: In the latest SciShow video host Michael Aranda discusses what we know about why some Covid-infected people are asymptomatic. This video was made in April clearly before the newest variants that sicken children made a splash but there is some good information. See also their playlist of Covid updates on what we’re learning. @AhsanteB’s interview with Dr. Bisola Ojikutu of the Harvard School of Public Health answers a lot of questions that the vaccine-hesitant or curious might be thinking. It’s a good presentation obviously aimed at the Black community but informative to anyone. Variants: 🦠 Dr. Fauci talks with Seth Meyers about the new virus variants and how much danger they pose. 🦠 A video from the Wall Street Journal (whose news division remember is good) goes into more and geekier detail about how the variants work. 🦠 A Vox video reviews how smallpox was eradicated and discusses the roadblocks to fighting Covid in the same ways. This video is not specific to Covid but offers a fairly simple account of how our immune system works. NEW articles: The Atlantic has listed their ongoing virus coverage here and none is behind a paywall. They add new articles often including these two: A Year Without Germs and One Vaccine to Rule Them All. xaxnar’s diary (with its comment thread) discusses neurological impacts seen in “long-haul” Covid sufferers. wilderness voice’s KosAbility diary (and comment thread) offer further discussion of long Covid its symptoms and their relationship to ME/CFS. This tweet by Joseph Allen links to a NY Times visual presentation about how we can change the airflow in classrooms to make it safer. There’s also a link from there to an Instagram “augmented reality” classroom visit. The Washington Post is maintaining this page that tracks vaccine arrival and distribution state by state. Note this is NOT paywalled. This virus spread tracking site also has an excellent “wiki” page on virus information/misinformation proper mask use symptoms etc.  h/t eeff! This excellent video explains clearly how viruses are killed by washing with soap.   h/t Sara R! A doctor shows how to quickly alter a disposable mask to get a safer fit. CDC chart shows how to remove gloves properly to avoid contamination. The lung exercises in this diary are still good for anyone sick or not. [Sara R and winglion have suspended taking orders for masks while Sara is recovering from her surgery. Sara is home from the hospital and everything went well!] WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—An explosive video that emerged last night appears to show President Joe Biden plotting to use his power to improve living conditions in the United States. In the video in which Biden is flanked by Vice-President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the President seemingly admits to having a radical scheme to use taxpayers’ money for the benefit of taxpayers.   [snip] “Joe Biden works hard to project a ‘nice guy’ image but this tape reveals the real Joe Biden” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “A man who all along has been scheming to expand education and child care.” ... — The Borowitz Report at The New Yorker This Week in Boredom:
