L, Chauvin's Potential Sentence, NoMoJoe, 2021-04-23, The jury found Derek Chauvin guilty of all three charges that had been brought against him:  second-degree murder (“unintentional felony murder”) third-degree murder (“depraved heart”) and second-degree manslaughter. What does that mean as far as how long Chauvin might stay in prison?  Under Minnesota law second-degree murder is punishable by a prison term of up to 40 years: MN Statutes § 609.19(2)(1): Whoever does either of the following is guilty of unintentional murder in the second degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 40 years: (1) causes the death of a human being without intent to effect the death of any person while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense other than criminal sexual conduct in the first or second degree with force or violence or a drive-by shooting; or Under Minnesota law third-degree murder is punishable by a prison term of up to 25 years: MN Statutes § 609.195 (a) Whoever without intent to effect the death of any person causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind without regard for human life is guilty of murder in the third degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 25 years. And under Minnesota law second-degree manslaughter is punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years: MN Statutes § 609.205(1) A person who causes the death of another by any of the following means is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than ten years or to payment of a fine of not more than $20000 or both: (1) by the person's culpable negligence whereby the person creates an unreasonable risk and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another; Does that mean that Chauvin is possibly facing 75 years in prison? No it doesn’t.  He’s more likely to be imprisoned for 10 to 13 years.
