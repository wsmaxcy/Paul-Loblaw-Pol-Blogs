C, George Soros is Still Spending Money to Destroy Responsible Civilization, Dana Pico, 2020-11-13, We have previously noted that Larry Krasner then a Democratic candidate for District Attorney in Philadelphia received a lot of money from billionaire America-hater George Soros in his 2017 campaign. Philadelphia had plenty of experience in treating criminals leniently and then being shocked shocked! when criminals who could have and should have been behind bars at the time upped their game to shooting police officers. Larry Krasner won the election to become District Attorney in Philadelphia in 2017 and was the beneficiary of a huge campaign contribution from leftist billionaire George Soros is a leftist who hates the police and doesn’t pursue supposedly petty offenses and ran on a platform saying he would: The wholly predictable results? In 2018 Mr Krasner’s first year in office city homicides jumped from 315 to 353 a 12.06% increase. The following year homicides held almost steady rising to 356 but this year 428 people have been murdered in the city as of 11:59 PM EST on November 12th a 40% increase over the same day last year good for 7th place all time in Philadelphia’s homicide history . . . with 49 days left in the year. But it seems that some people like lax law enforcement regardless of how many dead bodies it leaves on the streets. From The Philadelphia Inquirer: by Chris Brennan | November 13 2020 | 5:00 AM EST A political action committee organized this summer by retired Philadelphia police officers eager to oust District Attorney Larry Krasner next year said it supported 69 candidates in 17 states in last week’s election. And while Protect Our Police PAC says 38 of those candidates won it lost its first face-off with billionaire liberal philanthropist George Soros. Soros who spent almost $1.7 million to help Krasner win the 2017 Democratic primary election gave $244000 to a Georgia PAC backing Shalena Cook Jones who defeated two-term Republican Chatham County (Savannah) District Attorney Meg Heap. The Protect Our Police PAC took heat in the race with complaints that a billboard it posted was racist because it made it seem Jones supported violent protest (Jones is Black Heap is white) and that mailers attacking Soros’ involvement were anti-Semitic. The PAC denounced those as “false accusations meant to discredit and distract” and said “We unequivocally denounce racism and anti-Semitism.” PAC president Nick Gerace feels confident about 2021 vowing to “counter George Soros’ efforts to elect weak prosecutors who too often side with criminals rather than victims.” The PAC gave $50000 last month to State Rep. Martina White Philadelphia’s only Republican state legislator and a regular Krasner foe. It also sent mailers to retired cops supporting the reelection of state Attorney General Josh Shapiro an occasional Krasner foe. Krasner has shrugged off the PAC so far dismissing in an August fund-raising email the idea that “no one should ever challenge the thin blue line no matter the abuse or discrimination that occurs in our communities.” “(T)he abuse or discrimination that occurs in our communities”? A skyrocketing murder rate aided by Mr Krasner’s lenient treatment of lower level crimes doesn’t constitute abuse? Oh well I guess that it doesn’t count as racial discrimination when one black guy kills another black guy the most common description of murder in the City of Brotherly Love does it? Mr Soros was born on August 12 1930 making him 90 years old now. His mission in life appears to be to destroy responsible civilization by backing ‘social justice’ causes and Mr Krasner is right there serving as one of his accomplices.
