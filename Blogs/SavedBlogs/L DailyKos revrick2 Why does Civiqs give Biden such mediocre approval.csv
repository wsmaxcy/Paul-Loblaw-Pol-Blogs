L, Why does Civiqs give Biden such mediocre approval?, revrick2, 2021-07-05, I’ve noticed that Civiqs seems to be an outlier in polling Biden’s approval ratings. While the 538 aggregate has Biden’s approval fairly steady around 52% Civiqs has him below 50% since the American Rescue Plan and lately underwater. Can anyone explain?
