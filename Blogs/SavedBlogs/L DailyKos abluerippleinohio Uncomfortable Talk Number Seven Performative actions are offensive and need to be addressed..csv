L, Uncomfortable Talk Number Seven: Performative actions are offensive and need to be addressed., abluerippleinohio, 2021-05-10, I found this article from Catalyst.org talking about performative allyship. What is performative allyship? Here’s an excerpt from Catalyst .org explaining performative allyship. But some activists accused corporate participants of being performative allies. “Performative allies share their knowledge about inequity with others but don’t use their privilege and resources to make real change” says Xochitl Ledesma Catalyst’s Director of Leading for Equity & Inclusion. Performative allyship hurts the people it’s meant to support and maintains the status quo by appearing to promote change without producing change—which is inequitable and demoralizing. I emboldened that section because that action does what it says; it hurts the people needing the support. I have experienced it.  This was a person that was in my circle. I couldn’t figure out why I wasn’t invited to her house. I introduced her to my friends. She talked to my parents. She was invited to my home. It took a fight with her best friend for the truth to manifest before my eyes; I was her friend for the purpose of changing her parents’ minds about Black people. I had a boss that gave me assignments that looked good for his advancement but didn’t help advance me. I haven’t seen these people in sometime. I shudder to think what would come out of my mouth should the occasion arise that I come into contact with either or both of them. Does performative allyship exist in the political arena? Here are some tweets. We told y’all but you wouldn’t listen. Warren made the fatal mistake of believing Black Blue checks could deliver Black votes. She’s always had zero political instincts so not getting it is on brand for her. https://t.co/8NLemvWqXW  People are progressive don’t shout they are progressive. They get stuff done. These “new progressives” are the ones who are loud and always wrong. #ChantaysAnalysis pic.twitter.com/faH6mgzdSx  One of the reasons why I can't respect the far left ashy hoteps and pickmes because as aggressively as y'all critiqued Biden and Harris about not calling Amerikkka racist; your silence is equally as aggressive about these federal charges for Chauvin and his crew. 🙄🙄🙄🙄 I thought I would add this video.  Here’s my point; there are experiences in life that prepare those affected by performative allies. The performative actions are seen not rewarded.  Here's a video I found on YouTube.  Here's an article from Christians For Social Change that's about performative allyship. Kindly please read or bookmark the above mentioned link. i’m leaving you with these words. It is not enough to simply distance oneself from the perception of racism. True allyship is actively anti-racist. Thank you for coming to my TED talk!
