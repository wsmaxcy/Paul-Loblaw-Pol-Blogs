April 2021 Flint Hills Kansas For nearly every claim of “development” there is a counter claim of destruction particularly when the parcel in question is one of natural habitat. I am officially entrenched with the latter. The Red Tail above is one of magnificent beauty and optimum health.  This diary is one of heartbreak not only for him but for another of my revered denizens of the Flint Hills raptor world Kestrel Chief. They have inhabited adjoining and overlapping homelands which I have often focused on during my photo excursions along the Wagon Trail. Here is the original image from which I plucked the above picture. For the past several days there has been a massive effort to denude the landscape along this area of the Wagon Trail. Following is what it looks like now with more work planned by those committing this atrocity. The area east of the above photo has already been raped by the blade with more to be done. I saw both these revered hawks this morning. They were not their usual selves. Following is a sequence of photos which in my opinion clearly demonstrate these birds are traumatized. I am posting them in the order they were taken.      On behalf of many of my Relatives I relate to these birds and the circumstances they face. Sorry for the doom and gloom. Tomorrow is another day.  I’ll try to pick up the mood a bit with some things I’ve since seen further west along the Trail toward home. Here’s a pic I want to post with an asterisk. *ATT: OZARK. LOL How about I introduce a FIRSTER sighting and photos? To the best of my knowledge I had never seen this bird before. I’m still not sure I even know what it is! But after studying my guide book I am inclined to think it could be an immature Scissor Tailed Flycatcher. Judging by the guidebook pics I would love to see it stay here to maturity. They are sensationally beautiful birds.    What is your ID pick for this bird?  I have some other goodies I’m saving for another day. But I’ll open this diary up to comments with something special something warm and fuzzy even when in focus!  Yep it’s another hawk pic…  LOL. Post away!
