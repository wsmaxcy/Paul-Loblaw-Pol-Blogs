L, Morning Open Thread - Pertinent subject Day - 16, CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-07-04, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve been given the task of hosting the Sunday edition of the MOT time.  Let’s see what we can explore. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. Another holiday fell on a Sunday.  Today is the celebration of the Independence of the United States.  Flags will fly speeches will be made and people will swell with pride and over indulgence.  Fanfare for the accomplishments of our past is the focus of today.  I offer this musical score by one that knows how to present appreciation.    For those that like a longer version of this great tune I offer the Emerson Lake and Palmer version.   The first time I saw the Boston Pops live (late 1960’s) I fell in love with the glory of musical celebration.  This single piece still gives me chills of excitement.   For those of us with family members that served in the Continental Army or the various militias against the Crown my thanks for your ancestors help in establishing our nation.  A personal thank you to my mother’s relative John Creasey (Battle of Guilford County NC) and from my father’s side Edwin and John Ingram (Battle of King’s Mountain).  Tarheels held their ground.  I want to keep my segment short today.  We may have things planned and need to get out and with the scheduled programs.  Stay and visit if you can but enjoy today regardless of your agenda.  Happy Birthday America.
