L, Ted Cruz’s ‘Brazen Gaslighting’ Message Backfires Spectacularly On Twitter, Ed Mazza, 2021-06-29, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Monday accused White House press secretary Jen Psaki of “brazen gaslighting.”  But given his own history it didn’t go well.  Cruz shared a video of Psaki saying Republicans are essentially defunding the police because they voted against the coronavirus relief American Rescue Plan which included $350 billion for local law enforcement agencies. Cruz tweeted: Brazen gaslighting. https://t.co/punJWd9gRT Fox News anchor Chris Wallace made the same point on Sunday during an interview with Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.). “Congressman Banks you voted against that package against that $350 billion just like every other Republican in the House and Senate” Wallace said. “So can’t you make the argument that it’s you and the Republicans who are defunding the police?”  Cruz also voted against the bill.  His many critics were quick to point to his own history of gaslighting including his vote against the certification of the 2020 election based on disproven lies and conspiracy theories and his shifting story after he was caught fleeing on a Mexico vacation as his home state suffered a major humanitarian crisis over the winter. How convenient for you to finally remember this word. Now do “traitor” and “coward”. Republicans voted against the $350 Million Biden proposed to fund the police. I'd call that defunding. Gaslighting is pretending you just had to go to Cancun when there was a major state of emergency then pretending you were always coming right back.  pic.twitter.com/T3gmSSAJ7Z I’ll take “Things I’ll tweet to avoid talking about my vote against helping the American people” for $1000. https://t.co/l3F0sDUkYt Ted is the epitome of gaslighting. Projecting once again. https://t.co/5VskKEpG17 This was literally you when Texans ran out of Gas and Light Seniore Raphael pic.twitter.com/jtH8GdaRet Ted CruzChev modern day Insurrection Supporter & known liar cries foul.
