L, Trump Dogged By 'Loser-Palooza' Airplane Message At Florida Rally, Mary Papenfuss, 2021-07-05, Embarrassing news came for Donald Trump from on high during his Sarasota rally Saturday in the form of a plane flashing the neon message: “Loser-Palooza.” The message — flying over the Florida fairgrounds where Trump was speechifying — was funded and arranged by the anti-Trump pot-stirring political action committee MeidasTouch. It quickly trended on Twitter after it was noted by radio and TV journalists and spectators snapping cell phones pictures. “It’s a bird it’s a plane it’s our #LoserPalooza plane flying over the Trump loser fest” MediasTouch guffawed on Twitter.

Stand by for video from the ground. #LoserPalooza pic.twitter.com/Yu5uYfVpXM Since Trump’s favorite insult is “loser” the message was pretty perfect noted several Twitter users. Trump yet again complained in Sarasota about being the loser in the presidential election — though he again falsely insisted the race was rigged. He also appeared to admit to some of the essential points in the 15-felony count federal indictment filed last week against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg — that the company and Weisselberg didn’t pay taxes on what Trump called “fringe benefits.” Federal prosecutors said in the indictment that those “fringe benefits” were part of a scheme to allegedly dodge massive amounts of taxes for both the Trump Organization and executives. “You didn’t pay tax” Trump told the crowd. “I don’t even know. Do you have to? Does anybody know the answer to that stuff?” Two other planes spotted near the rally were reportedly also pulling message banners reading “Convict Trump and Lock Him UP!” and “Trump: Worst President Ever.”  But Twitter followers were particular fans of “Loser-Palooza.” How great is it that on the birthday of this country #LoserPalooza is trending and Trump has to read about it? #LoserPalooza"Meidas Touch stoled Donald Trump Sarasota rally by a land slide" pic.twitter.com/EaryYAVJE0 #LoserPalooza is what happens when you're too dumb to just "take the L" and go home after a humiliating loss. pic.twitter.com/xIRxVFQSUW Well played Meidas Touch well played.How long until you get to do the banner "Surrender Donald!"? There was a person riding a bike with a big Biden/Harris sign riding past the fairgrounds in the rain (we were stuck in traffic coming back from Home Depot.) That took guts! “The likes of which you have never seen.” 🤣Famous last words from #LoserPalooza pic.twitter.com/BlnQ7NB8Qt In remembrance of #LoserPalooza … I’m cutting off the crust on the sandwiches I bring to the weekly Antifa meeting.
