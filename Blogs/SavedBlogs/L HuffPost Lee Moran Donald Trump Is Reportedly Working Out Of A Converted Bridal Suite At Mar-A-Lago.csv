Orr citing unnamed sources at Mar-a-Lago said “nothing was set up” for Trump or his aides when he vacated the White House and moved to Florida on Jan. 20. He was initially “reluctant to turn it into his office but ultimately aides said ‘You need a space to operate at’ and so that became that space.” The Washington Post reported on the bridal suite-turned-office detail in February.  Trump’s new office “is the Mar-a-Lago Club’s old bridal suite” and he is “working from a repurposed dressing room in Florida” read an article detailing the economic hit to Trump’s businesses following his presidency.
