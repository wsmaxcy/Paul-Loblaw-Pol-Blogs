L, Morning Open Thread:  Infringin', dijitforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-05-11, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve come to think of this post as one where you come for the music and stay for the conversation—so feel free to drop a note. The diarist gets to sleep in if he/she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. ~ Mornin’ y’all —  Got nuthin today except for two images which pretty much say it all —  (It was actually a decent brew...) And from my brother in law this sticker of glory —  That’s it.  That’s all.   Nothing cogent to add (thanks ex!)  Be good humans!
