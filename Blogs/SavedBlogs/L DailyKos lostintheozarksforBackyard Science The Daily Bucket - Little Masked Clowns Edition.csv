We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note lifeâ€™s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below. For those of you who did not see my comment last Friday evening June 25th near the end of my Wildflower Bucket I will repeat it here: To all of you who read my previous Bucket about Limpy the crippled raccoon: This morning we saw Limpy at the feeder and gave him some food. This afternoon My husband saw him sleeping under our Hollyhocks in the flower bed and decided not to disturb him. However when he went out at feeding time Limpy did not show up. He was still under the Hollyhocks and he apparently died in his sleep. We are sad but I think we made his last days of life a little easier.ðŸ˜¢ Limpy was buried the following day. This photo was one of the last few I took when he was at the feeder a few days before. He was not looking better and he seemed almost blind: Anyway recently the local raccoons have been putting on a clown show for me and I appreciated their effort. One day my morning walk was interrupted by the unusual sight of an early morning ramble by one of the locals: Another day we were entertained by one of the raccoons trying to make it to the top of the feeder pole: He did not make it to the top â€” in fact he slid almost all the way down jumping to the ground before the cable squeezed him too tightly: I saw a squirrel try the same thing a week or two ago but didnâ€™t have my camera handy for the upward part. The squirrel actually made it up into the baffle before realizing he couldnâ€™t get any higher turned around and headed back down: But back to the raccoons! It was almost like they were trying to cheer us up but really it was probably just their normal behavior begging for food. Looking up at the window bird feeders: Then realizing I was watching him from the other side of that door over there: And then moving a little closer to take a look inside: So I went and get some grapes (they love grapes). But when I opened the door this particular raccoon had a panic attack and ran off into the woods. This must not have been one of our regular friendly raccoons. Do you remember the one that used to feed her babies on the porch?:  There are so many of them and even if they are little bandits they are fun to watch: And the babies are adorable!
