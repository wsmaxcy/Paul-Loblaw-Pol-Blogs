L, The delusional plan to boot Biden and restore Trump to power from the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, HalBrown, 2021-07-07, Correction: An earlier version of this diary referred to the Stay-Puff Mashmallow Man it’s “Stay-Puft.” In CNN this interview with Wolf Blitzer NY Times reporter Maggie Haberman said: Once the results of these "audits" are released Haberman claims Trump believes that America will have no choice but to let him back into the White House. "He continues to believe there will be something that will undo Joe Biden's win in one of those states that made Joe Biden president" she said. "That somehow this will either muddy up his victory or that it could end up going to the Supreme Court and then returning the victory to the former president." "It's very very hard to track the roots of this conspiracy theory and how they suggest it would happen" she said. "But this is something that the former president has been focussed on for many months. This is not just in the dark recesses of the internet." From RawStory You can watch the interview here: This once again brings up the biggest unknown in all of this as far as Trump’s actual really actual literal clinical mental status about whether he is certifiably ready for the rubber room i.e. unable to tell wishful thinking from reality and suffering from a delusional disorder. Former Harvard psychiatrist Lance Dodes thinks he is. I think there is growing evidence that Dodes is correct but the fly in the DSM-5 ointment is the following (emphasis added): Delusions are false beliefs based on incorrect inference about external reality that persist despite the evidence to the contrary; these beliefs are not ordinarily accepted by other members of the person's culture or subculture. Ref.  The first part is true but Trump’s beliefs about the election being stolen and that he will return to the White House in short order are held by what you could characterize as his culture (or cult if you prefer). In  case you missed it there is an actual plan laid out on a large whiteboard displayed at conferences. One of the conferences at least was attended by Mr. Pillow. (An image of the giant Stay-Puft marshmallow man from Ghostbusters popped into my head as I wrote that hence my diary illustration. Here’s the Ghostbusters scene. Mr. Pillow Mike Lindell sold 40 million white stay pufty pillows and is worth about $300 million. )   This is how my mind works: the next thing that popped into my mind was this famous scene from “Five Easy Pieces.”  Waitress: I don't make the rules. Dupea: Okay I'll make it as easy for you as I can. I'd like an omelette plain and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast no mayonnaise no butter no lettuce and a cup of coffee. Waitress: A number two chicken sal san hold the butter the lettuce and the mayonnaise and a cup of coffee. Anything else? Dupea: Yeah. Now all you have to do is hold the chicken bring me the toast give me a check for the chicken salad sandwich and you haven't broken any rules. Waitress: You want me to hold the chicken huh? Dupea: I want you to hold it between your knees. [Palm and Terry smirk] Waitress: You see that sign sir? Yes you'll all have to leave. I'm not taking any more of your smartness and sarcasm. Dupea: You see this sign? [sweeps all the water glasses and menus off the table] But I digress… back to the story: Michael Flynn posted this picture today. I was finally able to locate a full view of the board behind him. (Telegram) (1/2) pic.twitter.com/y7vTg9TFXa  Trump can’t post on Twitter but he can read it so there’s a good chance he’s seen this video from Resist Programs (scroll down) showing closeups of segments of the secret plan: This same board made an appearance at the “Health and Freedom Conference” at Rhema Bible megachurch in Broken Arrow Oklahoma.Looks like they travel with it. pic.twitter.com/4jcPi0WUyd Trump can also watch YouTube and see how an associate of Clay Clark a podcaster who from what I can tell actually made the whiteboard explains the plan:  More about Clay Clark: “Pro-Trump Speaker Wants To Turn D.C. Rally Into ‘Mass-Spreader Event’” from HuffPost. Here he is ranting about how Covid-19 is really just a version of the flu and the PCR tests are fake: "The Covid-19 PCR tests are fake ... the models were fake" -- Now a coronavirus truther/grifter is speaking at the Trump rally pic.twitter.com/ysJzIbJ7KI Everything above is sheer madness. But is is a madness that flows both up and down. It flows up from the nether regions of the Trump cult and down from the cult leader himself. Whether you think it is a dangerous madness or not depends on whether you believe in the basic principles of American democracy.  It depends of who you want to include in these three words: The poll: I really doubt anyone reading this will want to purchase a My Pillow but on the off chance that you do here’s the website. Here’s more outright lunacy from Mr. Pillow: Mike Lindell: Biden wants to inject 'Mark of the Beast' vaccine into as many Americans as he can before Trump's reinstatement.
