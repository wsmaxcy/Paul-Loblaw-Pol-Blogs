L, Reactive power: the lesser known but equally important component of power grids, Risen Tree, 2021-04-29, Did you ever sit in your high school or college math classes and wonder “Where is anyone going to use this stuff?” For instance imaginary numbers. Who applies them in their daily lives? Power engineers do. More precisely the power that flows through power lines is modeled as a complex number P + jQ. P is active power which you already know about: A rotor spins around an electromagnet generating electricity. j is the imaginary unit the square root of -1; power engineers use j instead of i which is already used to measure current. Why complex numbers are used is beyond the scope of this diary; the abbreviated version is that it reduces a mathematically convoluted problem to one that is ahem less complex. But what exactly is Q reactive power? To understand this we’ll first focus on the two types of circuit elements most closely associated with reactive power: capacitors and inductors. Capacitors store a charge as electric energy. When that charge builds up the capacitor “pushes back” towards its discharged state. Think of a capacitor like a spring: The more you stretch it or squeeze it away from its resting state the harder it fights back toward that equilibrium. Inductors maintain current in the form of magnetic energy. They impede changes in that current. Think of an inductor like a weight on that spring: The more massive the weight the more it will impede the spring’s effort to speed up or slow down the weight. Capacitors and inductors are common in our every day lives. Capacitors are common in electronic chips for example; inductors are seen in transformers and motors. Motors have some electrical resistance as well so they are modeled as an “inductive load.” To see how they work let’s think about a weight attached to a firmly anchored spring. If you pull down on the weight what happens? The weight bobs up and down over and over again. If there were no external intervention such as from friction or air resistance the weight could bob up and down forever. This is because the spring and weight which are analogous to capacitors and inductors respectively do not remove or “dissipate” energy from the system. The two elements store and release store and release the energy but whenever one element releases the energy the other picks it up. Again without any friction or air resistance the potential energy stored in the spring plus the kinetic energy remains constant regardless of where the weight is or how fast it’s moving. In physics parlance energy is conserved. Understanding this conservation of energy is key to understanding reactive power. It is the distinctive difference between reactive and active power. Active power is actively dissipated by the load not conserved. The total energy in the universe is conserved but the total energy within the system is not. Active power requires continuous external energy to be input. Reactive power is conserved keeping its part of the energy contained in the system. Reactive power is modeled as being injected (created) by capacitors and consumed by inductors. Balancing this is key to balancing each part of the energy grid. Having an idea of what reactive power is why is it important to manage? Here are some of the reasons: 1. Voltage stability is sensitive to reactive power fluctuations. If there is a sudden surge or drop in reactive power it can cause the voltage to spike or collapse. Voltage collapse is believed to be a culprit in several major blackouts such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003 and the London blackout a few weeks later. (At this time the February Texas blackouts are believed not to be largely caused by reactive power mismanagement but active power shortages.) 2. Solar and wind disproportionately contribute to reactive power imbalances. This is one reason why power companies are often resistant to solar and wind energy. Even as energy storage begins to come online there will have to be a plan in place to consistently manage all the reactive power generated and drawn by renewable sources. 3. Even if reactive power is balanced its mere presence competes with the active power and puts excessive demand on the system. More electrical power has to be produced which means more waste. The good news is that this can be overcome. Because of the conservation of energy reactive power is much less costly to inject than active power. Solutions include: 1. Shunt capacitor banks. These are series of large capacitors that are wired in parallel to the grid. They can offset the inductance of power lines and inductive loads. 2. Static VAR compensators. Like shunt capacitors but can quickly adjust how much reactive power they inject or absorb. VAR stands for “volt-ampere reactive” the unit of reactive power. 3. Synchronous condensers. These are large flywheels that are mechanically connected to nothing. They can buffer shocks to reactive power. 4. Tap changers. They’re the electric equivalent of a gear shift in a transformer. With sophisticated equipment they can smooth out voltage spikes. I’m not sure. I haven’t found anything yet that suggests that reactive power regulation is included in Biden’s infrastructure bill. Neither does there seem to be much of that existing anyway. As best I could find energy companies manage reactive and active power on their own. Too often this means cost-cutting approaches that leave the vulnerable to to blackouts and brownouts. This is unacceptable. Energy companies should have to provide active power and manage reactive power robust to almost anything that the elements can throw at it. We shouldn’t have to foot the bill for major disruptions when a little extra investment on their part can prevent so many of them.
