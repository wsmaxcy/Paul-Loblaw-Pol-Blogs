L, 'Tehran Tom' Cotton Wants Biden To Declare War On Russia, John Amato, 2021-06-16, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Senator 'Tehran Tom' Cotton appeared on Fox News after President Biden's press conference in Geneva to do  his usual war hawk jig. Biden's press conference was a strong showing of his command on the issues at hand as well as his question-and-answer period Biden didn't go far enough for Cotton's liking. Sen. Cotton said that Putin only cares about power.  "Joe Biden could've said if the attacks continue maybe Russia's oil and gas plants are going to go down. Maybe their electrical grid is gonna go down" he complained. Spoken like a true warmonger.  Cotton didn't mind the former commander-in-chief kowtowing to Russia's president like a smitten puppy dog.  Telling the world you plan to attack Russia would not be the optimal negotiation tactic of any president no matter what Tehran Tom thinks. Fox News has refused to put any Biden administration officials on their airwaves to discuss the first meeting between Presidents Biden and Putin choosing instead to litter their shows with right-wing pundits and ex-traitor Trump officials to attack Biden and praise Putin. It's truly bizarre.  When I was a youngster the Soviet Union was the bad guy and our FBI military & intelligence community were the good guys. In today’s Trumpy/Fox Newsy Republican Party Russia is the good guy and OUR people are the bad guys. Fuck Trump and fuck Tucker Carlson. https://t.co/1JpOBzYCdb — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) June 16 2021 McFarland is a former US deputy national security adviser and she's not the only person on Fox today who has barely tried to conceal that they have more respect for Putin than the do for POTUS https://t.co/OVx99CaUAJ — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) June 16 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
