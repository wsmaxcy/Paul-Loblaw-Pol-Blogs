L, Ode to Nittens, Sally DeLurks, 2021-04-27, Ode to Nittens (on their one month adoptiversary)  Hail gregarious Griffin! Bold and brave!      Wearing the colors of steel of silver      With eyes that match. He is the first to say “Hello!”          “What’s this?  Can I play with it?”      “Where does this lead?”      “How do I get down from here?”   He claims to be unafraid of the dogs;      He can get within ten feet of one      (who is sleeping of course!)      without bushing up his fur! Griffin speaks in a light tenor voice.      I’ve never heard him speak a cross word. He has a ready purr and can stand to be snuggled      all of a half minute      before squirming      to be off and exploring again! He is tiny at almost four pounds      Yet he is unaware this is so.      He is quick agile and athletic.      He is not a marksman; his aim needs some work. Frontal assault and Crazy Ivan are his preferred modes            of attack.      He rarely lies in wait;      He disdains that as “too sneaky!” He will be the scout and the climber;      The one always on the kitchen counters      The victor over unattended food      The one who gets stuck in weird places      Just because      He had to see it! (soto voce) Hail milady Violet cautious but ever curious.      She wears a velvety fluff-puff      As black as starless night.      Her eyes a watchful steely grey. She is content to let her brother go first      And make sure she know the threats. She tells me she thinks he is silly.      “He thinks treats are shrimp-flavored toys!”      “He doesn’t know where the red dot lives!”      “Watch this: I’ll hide and bop him!” Violet indulges Griffin listening to his grand tales      of bravely standing up to the giant dog!      She gently teases him about how big the dog really is.      She gets big-eyed and says “Was he growling?”      She doesn’t tell him that she was there too      And that sound was really just snoring. And yet she is the one who has actually dared to touch the dog.      It’s true: a nose to the pad of a hind foot of a sleeping dog.      And while an expeditious retreat ensued      No fur was raised in the adventure! Violet’s quiet voice is a rich contralto.      She has been heard saying “bad words”…      Mostly when the path of a poorly planned retreat      suddenly becomes through the water bowl! She purrs the moment she is touched.      Sometimes she purrs when simply spoken to.      Her purr is deep…      A major third lower than Griffin’s      And together they sing a major chord. Violet is smaller than Griffin      Although her fluff hides that well.      She is not quite 3.5 pounds.      She is not as strong nor as agile as Griffin.      Jumps he makes easily can frequently      Take Violet two tries or a little bit of a climb at the end. Violet is interested in what makes things work:      “Look! The squeaky mouse is attached to a string! And…      The string is stuck to a stick! And that’s …      (looking back at the squeaky mouse)      Well I’ll figure that out later!” “Look!  This turns on the…      Wait! That stuff is WET!      That’s water! Yow!      I’m outta here!”       (as she dashes off to the deepest darkest corner of deep-safe-haven!) When jumping from a precariously balanced stack of clothes “Hey!      Where did that big pile of stuff that almost landed on me come from?      Oh…wait… (sniff sniff) I was just lying in that stuff…”      (looking up to the launch site)      “Did I do that?      Wow.      Amazing.      I’m outta here!”      (as she dashes off to the deepest darkest corner of deep-safe-haven!) Violet fights like a Ninja.  She waits in the dark…      Around corners or behind any cover (no matter how small)      The tip of her tongue shows while she focuses.      When Griffin (or a human foot) walks by      She strikes!  Darting out from cover      She delivers a deadly-accurate velvet-pawed BOPP!      Then laughs over her shoulder as she dashes away. Violet will almost always follow Griffin’s lead.        She will let him discover the obvious threats and rewards      of nearly everything and then decide whether to follow. I expect Griffin’s mishaps and adventures will arise from “What’s this?”      and Violet’s will arise from “Why?” I expect Violet to become a Papa’s girl.        She seems to carry the spirit      of another beloved cat      long across the rainbow bridge.        I think they share memory-echoes      that will grow over the years. Ok I know it’s not an ode. I know it’s not even any kind of poetry. Call it word-picture prose if you want. The thing is that the first stanza for each nitten ran around in my head for more than a week before I wrote them down. They felt a little Camelot-ish to me. And so Ode to Nittens is what I named this long before I began writing it. This is actually the first piece I wrote about the nittens.  This is Part 2 of a multiple part series called Nittens are in the House!
