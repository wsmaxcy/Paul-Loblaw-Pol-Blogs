L, Missouri's health care systems are buckling under a CoVid Delta variant surge., ian douglas rushlau, 2021-07-07, Beth Mole at Ars Technica reminds us that GOP voters and the moronic fascists they install in positions of authority remain *Murderous Clowns*: As the delta variant spreads rapidly in Missouri and cases of COVID-19 surge some hospitals in the state are already strained. And projections suggest things will only get worse in the coming weeks. Cases have increased 45 percent statewide in the past two weeks with hospitalizations rising 24 percent according to data tracking by The New York Times. Numerous counties across the state have high per-capita infection rates some as high as one in seven residents infected. But many of the counties with the highest daily new cases are clustered in Missouri's southwest corner. Taney County home to the popular tourist town of Branson in southwest Missouri has seen daily cases increase 50 percent in the last two weeks with hospitalizations increasing 62 percent. Taney has an average of 52 daily new cases per 100000 residents the third-highest daily case rate in the state. North of Taney in the southwestern corner is Dallas County which has the second-highest average of daily new cases at 63 per 100000. Cases there have increased 74 percent in the last two weeks while hospitalizations increased 44 percent… Low vaccination rates in Missouri are a critical vulnerability particularly as the highly transmissible delta variant runs rampant through the state. According to variant-tracking efforts run by researchers at Scripps Research in La Jolla California Missouri has the highest prevalence of the delta variant of any state. Based on limited genetic evidence as of June 23 the delta variant made up an estimated 96 percent of daily cases in the Show Me State. No worries Missouri’s governor has a firm handle on the situation and is jumping to into action to save lives … bolster healthcare resources…  increase vaccination rates… shield those profiting off the pandemic from legal responsibility when they cause harm: Today I traveled to Koller-Craft Plastics in Fenton to sign Senate Bill 51 - COVID Liability into law. This legislation helps protect those who helped protect us during some of the hardest days of the pandemic. pic.twitter.com/1BRddtEtUf  With cases rising new law will shield Missouri businesses from COVID lawsuits The bill was one of Gov. Mike Parson’s top priorities and sets a high standard for plaintiffs to meet Tessa Weinberg/ Missouri Independent July 7 2021 As a new surge of COVID cases overtakes Missouri businesses healthcare providers and houses of worship will soon be shielded from most COVID-related lawsuits under a bill Gov. Mike Parson signed Wednesday. Senate Bill 51 sponsored by Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer R-Parkville provides sweeping protections for businesses unless a high standard of proof can be met. It was killed and revived in the last weeks of the legislative session and ultimately passed in the session’s final hour despite some lawmakers’ concerns about its scope… Under the bill plaintiffs would have up to one year to pursue a lawsuit against a healthcare provider like a nursing home or hospital alleging medical malpractice and must prove harm occurred as a result of “recklessness or willful misconduct.”  An elective surgery delayed for good cause would not be considered “recklessness or willful misconduct” according to the bill. Plaintiffs would have up to two years in cases of product liability or after an alleged exposure like claiming the virus was contracted on a business’s premises. Customers would also waive liability and assume the risk of potentially being exposed to the virus if they enter a building that has a warning notice posted. Religious organizations like churches are also explicitly exempt from being held liable for alleged exposure of the virus unless the plaintiff “can prove intentional misconduct” and are not required to post a warning notice.  As I said *Murderous Clowns*. Spot the trend...  In Southern states with the slowest rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine the strongest indicator of very low vaccination rates is … Trump voters. Simply where Trump got more votes fewer get vaccinated.That’s a big problem. And this is a thread 1/. https://t.co/XsUBC77N7I  There's A Stark Red-Blue Divide When It Comes To States' Vaccination Rates As of Tuesday nearly 64% of U.S. adults have had at least one shot according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The key issue is that demand has dropped off. After an initial crush the number of doses being administered daily is on a steep decline from the early April peak. So what's going on? A few things to note:
