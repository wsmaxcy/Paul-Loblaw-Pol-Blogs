C, The Trump Campaign Should Reject Kristen Welker's List Of Debate Topics As Irrelevant, Martin Knight, 2020-10-17, The Debate Commission’s selected moderator for the “Third” Debate Kristen Welker just released her chosen list of topics for October 22nd as follows; Fighting COVID-19 American Families Race in America Climate Change National Security Leadership. As the folks at Twitchy have noted this list contains very few of the issues that the American people tell posters that they’re concerned about.

For at least two decades a parade of the feeblest and most obsequious “moderate” Republicans have been selected to serve with sharper minded and strongly partisan liberal Democrats on the Commission resulting in solely partisan liberal journalists being selected to serve as “moderators” for Presidential debates. No Republican in his right mind would select someone as weak and ineffectual as Olympia Snowe to represent his or her interests. If she was your lawyer you’d get the death penalty for shoplifting a piece of gum and tell you it’s a great deal … and that’s with video evidence of you on the other side of town alibis willing to testify under oath and the actual perpetrator swearing a confession. By the way let’s interpret Kristen Welker’s list of topics from sinistrohackese to plain English;
