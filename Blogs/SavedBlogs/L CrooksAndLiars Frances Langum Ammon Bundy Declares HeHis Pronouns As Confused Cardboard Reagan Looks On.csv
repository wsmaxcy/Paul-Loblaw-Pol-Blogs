L, Ammon Bundy Declares He/His Pronouns As Confused Cardboard Reagan Looks On, Frances Langum, 2021-06-21, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Ammon Bundy the guy who engaged in a violent standoff with the federal government in 2016 wants a government job.   This past weekend he announced he is running for Governor of Idaho.  But what caught people's attention was his attempt at humor.  He began his announcement by "joking" that his pronouns are he/him. Ammon Bundy’s Big Announcement….. it’s not that he’s running for Governor of Idaho…. #sovcit #commonlaw pic.twitter.com/Vd91nwslMq — Verigo Kennedy (@VerigoKennLove) June 20 2021 The cardboard cutout of Ronald Reagan in the background appeared as confused by the attempt at "humor" as we are.   There was also a cardboard Trump and someone with a "Little Gay King" cape.  So he's got those cardboard/red satin endorsements going for him.

And it's unclear whether Ammon Bundy is registered (or eligible at this point in his probation) to vote in Idaho. And there's another problem.  As a FELON Bundy has been banned from entering the Idaho Capitol for two years.  So actually going to work might be difficult.   FUN FACT: Ammon Bundy is banned from the Idaho State Capitol. https://t.co/gNtUx6cVZd — Agent Smith (@anonycraig) June 20 2021 We should ask other Republicans running for office around the country though.  Do you support armed standoffs with federal officers?  Is threatening to kill officers of the law okay with you?   Because your fellow Second Amendment conservative thinks it's fine and he's running for Governor of Idaho.   If a Black person or any person of color did this s/he would be crucified by the media & face mob violence."Ammon Bundy the anti-government militant who led an armed takeover of a US wildlife refuge is running for governor of Idaho" https://t.co/k8FghmbuES via @Yahoo — Leone Jose Bicchieri (@BicchieriLeone) June 21 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
