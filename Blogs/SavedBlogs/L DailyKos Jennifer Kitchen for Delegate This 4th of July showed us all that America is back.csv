L, This 4th of July showed us all that America is back, Jennifer Kitchen for Delegate, 2021-07-07, After the last year of pandemic-forced isolation it was such a delight to be able to finally come together as a community in honor of our nation’s birth this weekend.   We’ve come a long way compared to where we were just a year ago and I know this is only the beginning.   I spent my 4th of July doing what I love best: spending time out in my community. I got the full small-town America experience at the Crozet Independence Day parade where I not only got to meet some wonderful people but also load up on delicious food. As I looked out on the crowd of people decked in patriotic gear waving American flags I couldn’t help but feel an enormous sense of pride. The past year has been difficult for so many in so many ways but what I saw this 4th of July weekend was a profound sense of optimism and hope for the future that I haven’t felt in so long.  For me this weekend wasn’t just about parades and cotton candy. I also got to participate in that most American of activities: knocking doors and meeting voters. (You can read more about my groundbreaking rural campaign here.)  Listening to voters’ concerns in person is the most important and rewarding part of running for office and I was so happy to be back at it again this weekend.  How about you? How did you celebrate Independence Day this year? JENNIFER KITCHEN — DELEGATE FOR VA 25       FACEBOOK   TWITTER    INSTAGRAM   DONATE
