L, Oy. Movin' Right Along., CameronProf, 2021-05-05, Movin’ Right Along In Search of Good Times or Good News  I am committed to living in a nursing home the rest of my life. The problem is most nursing homes do not have the best reputation and change owners every other day.  The first place I ended up was very nice. In order though to stay long term in a nursing home you have to qualify for Medicaid. Until you do you stay at the first place. Once approved you can stay at the first spot ONLY if they have a long term Medicaid bed. If not you get placed in another place. This is what happened to me.  I thought that I was lucky in fact I shared pictures of the second place I stayed at it looks like a mansion and it got a lot of positive responses since I noted that my best friend’s mother had stayed here and it was very nice.  That was said too soon. It was under prior ownership before. Now were I am at is chronically understaffed they will have 1 nurse covering 40 patients or no nurse at all for a few hours until they can call one in… and hope no emergencies come up. They are also chronically short of nursing aids. There has been instances of 1 aid covering 60 people or no aids in for hours at a time. Which means if you soil yourself you’re in trouble or if you fall down and press the call light you’re on the floor for a long time.  These shortages are not unique to one place or another but seem to be hit or miss even with facilities that have the same owner. One might be OK the other not so good.  The food here is not good either which is OK...who comes to nursing homes for food right? So the quality of the food though I complain about (Soaked with gravy meat parts served ice cold) but I do find fault with pork. For religious reasons my ticket/order specify NO pork.  SO guess what I get every other meal? Yes..pork. Hey it is not my fault that they did not know ham was pork right? Is what I heard. They made it somewhat OK to celebrate Pesach...that is if it only lasted 3 days. The problem? It lasts 8. So I was totally screwed food-wise which is one of the major ways the holiday is observed.  So I am moving. The next place could be hit or miss. Only time will tell. I am moving back to the city I grew up in and where the good nursing home was as well as where my assisted living place was… it seems I always end up back in the same city.  It (the new place) is in the heart of the older Jewish community in MI and they are trying to build up their Jewish population at the nursing home so I was told my Observations and keeping Kosher would not be a problem.  So today at 4:30 I move…
