L, IAN: April 23 2021 Just a simple diary, FloridaSNMOMforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-22, Happy Friday! It’s grocery day today. Hopefully I feel better than I have so far this week. I’ve been tired and brain fried and off all week. I had two seizures on Wednesday and that hasn’t helped any. Add in that my hip is acting up  plus twitchiness and yeah. fun.   As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos. If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we are going to check up on you. If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here. We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries. Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime! We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! Monday Crimson Quillfeather Tuesday ejoanna Wednesday Pam from Calif Thursday art ah zen Friday FloridaSNMOM Saturday FloridaSNDad Sunday loggersbrat So this is going to be a simple diary today.
