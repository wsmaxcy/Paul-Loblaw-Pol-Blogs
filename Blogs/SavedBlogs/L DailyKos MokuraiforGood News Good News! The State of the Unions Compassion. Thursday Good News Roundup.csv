L, Good News! The State of the Union's Compassion. Thursday Good News Roundup, MokuraiforGood News, 2021-04-29, No matter what you call it Joe Biden told us yesterday point by point about the State of the Union of the American soul both the compassionate caring responsible competent side and the White Supremacist terrorist side. Or on some issues notably the aforementioned domestic terrorism the State of the Disunion. I am not going to go through it point by point. Lots of others will do that. I will say that he began Madame Speaker.   Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium and it’s about time. Then he addressed all of our major issues you know which ones in a sane and caring way as he has been doing throughout the campaign and his first 99 days as President and invited all of us to join him in making it so. In particular he pointed out that we need to work together on American technology and jobs in order to defeat Global Warming and to build back our economy and our society and to compete with the rest of the world especially China. Meanwhile Joe Manchin read a book and the Rs sat on their hands almost every time the Ds stood up and applauded about the environment and jobs and a living wage and more free education and family leave and child care and no wait I said I wouldn’t get into everything. You know any way. The word of the day turns out to be Look. And then afterwards Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina the only Black GQP Senator haughtily got up on his hind feet and whinged about all of it. To hear him tell it Ds voted for five bipartisan covid relief bills last year but now they are totally divisive bringing up totally partisan bills that no R could possibly vote for. [snort guffaw Bronx cheer at the TVnator machine in lieu of expressing any kind of violent hatred] No Tim you have it backwards. The bipartisan party is the one that votes for bills originating from the other side when their own bills can’t get a hearing. Scott told us how poor he grew up; he told us how the New York Times was oppressing him about it; he complained about being called an Uncle Tom. No Tim you are not Uncle Tom. Nobody should ever call you that. Not in order to be polite though. It’s because you are an R through and through—a Simon God-Damned Legree in fealty to the Devil and you don’t even know it. And a liar too. A bad liar not even one whose style one can appreciate in the manner of Molly Ivins explaining the humorous side of racist East Texas judges. (See Gohmert Louis one of the finest specimens of the breed.) I will not review all of the nonsense in Scott’s response to Biden’s sensible and uplifting outreach to all of America. That too you can find elsewhere. The MSNBC crew marveled at the depth of malice and attempted deception therein. You will also have to look elsewhere for news about the FBI raiding the homes of Rudy Giuliani and Victoria Toensing yesterday over their Ukraine shenanigans. C-SPAN: President Biden Addresses Joint Session of Congress With transcript of address as delivered. Rachel Maddow estimated right afterward that it was about half improvised on the spot. President Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. He discussed his actions over the first 100 days of his… read more  C-SPAN also included Scott’s um—actually never mind. I don’t want to get myself started again. White House: Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President Biden — Address to a Joint Session of Congress NPR: President Biden's Address To Congress Annotated President Biden says he's putting Vice President Harris in charge of overseeing certain elements of his massive infrastructure proposal. This would be a major domestic assignment for Harris. Biden has already tasked her with handling diplomatic efforts to address the increased flow of migrants from Central America. A SOTU even if we aren’t supposed to call it that is mainly a case of tell don’t show. That’s all very well but I mean to show you a few things. Just a few. Feel free to add your own in the comments. Top 10 Coolest Electric Car Commercials It’s for real this year folks. Also here is the first electric schoolbus in Columbus IN where I live. Biden wants us to buy US-made wind and solar. Conventional wisdom has it that the Chinese own both markets. This turns out not exactly to be the case especially if we start investing in US technology again. Top 10 Things You Didn't Know About Wind Power Most of the components of wind turbines installed in the United States are manufactured here. There are more than 500 wind-related manufacturing facilities located across 43 states and the U.S. wind industry currently employs more than 114000 people. There is a similar story for solar. There are plenty of targets for investment. U.S. solar panel manufacturers: a list of American-made solar panels We have heard of various police reform initiatives. These two seem particularly promising. Newark cops with reform didn’t fire a single shot in 2020 The City that Really Did Abolish the Police And rebuilt the department from the ground up. The strange hopeful politically complicated story of Camden N.J. Garland returns to Oklahoma City to warn that domestic terrorism is 'still with us' The attorney general has vowed to crack down on a resurgence of violence linked to white supremacist and right-wing militia groups. Pentagon orders new steps to tackle extremism in the ranks  DoD is also working on questionnaires to detect extremists. I know of some good ones. Grokking Republicans: Authoritarian Followers Leaders and Doubles We have two primary measurement scales for different kinds of Authoritarian to work with both carefully designed and validated by means of many experiments and then applied to a variety of important questions. Numerous other scales connect these two to many particular issues. Right Wing Authoritarianism: Obedience to accepted authority and rejection of supposedly illegitimate authority is a key trait along with unrealistic fears aggression difficulties with facts and logic extreme self-righteousness blindness to themselves hypocrisy ethnocentrism and dogmatism. Social Dominance Orientation: The SDO scale was created as a measure of a belief in social inequality that is a desire for social dominance. It then turned out to be an excellent predictor of racism one that had a low correlation 0.20 with the RWA scale. But the two taken together predict most of racism which neither can do on its own. Dozens of other scales have been proposed for measuring and predicting racism but only RWA and SDO do so at all well. It is not just racism that these scales measure. It is any form of excessive deference to or claims of authority including denial that other people of any kind matter for whatever reason and that various measures from denial of human rights to outright genocide are justified and desirable. The available evidence suggests that immigration leads to more innovation a better educated workforce greater occupational specialization better matching of skills with jobs and higher overall economic productivity. Immigration also has a net positive effect on combined federal state and local budgets. But not all taxpayers benefit equally. In regions with large populations of less educated low-income immigrants native-born residents bear significant net costs due to immigrants’ use of public services especially education. We can help with that of course through improved education for the less educated low income natives. Biden mentioned that Reaganomics has failed every test. No tax cut has ever resulted in increased tax revenue by way of economic growth. Also that even economists on the right have had good things to say about economic growth this year. Not Larry Kudlow of course who got himself all in a tizzy about plant-based beer. (No joke as Biden would say.) Nor the Cato Institute which is also wrong on pretty much everything to do with economics. Economics denial is as bad as science denial in all of its forms. The worst is humanity denial.
