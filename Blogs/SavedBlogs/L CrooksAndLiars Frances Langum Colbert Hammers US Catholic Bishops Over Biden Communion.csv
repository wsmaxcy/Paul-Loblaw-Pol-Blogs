L, Colbert Hammers US Catholic Bishops Over Biden Communion, Frances Langum, 2021-06-22, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Stephen Colbert is Catholic.  But as the CBS late night host noted in Monday's monologue President Joe Biden is REALLY Catholic.  "Now listen. People know this I'm Catholic" said Colbert. "But Biden is sooo Catholic. He's the only guest I've ever spent time with backstage talking about the consolations of God and the need for daily rosary — so far! Ball's in your court Andrew Garfield!" Members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in contradiction to the Vatican's wishes (yeah) want to deny President Biden communion over his pro-choice NOT pro-abortion political stance.  "Yep they're Holy Ghosting him" said Colbert.  Then Stephen went for the kill and twisted the comedy knife -- ouch. "I'm not sure how serious the bishops are here — if they really wanted to punish Biden they'd move him to a different parish and not tell anyone why they did it." "That joke is based on a true story."  Colbert noted. He closed out the bit with a nod to presidential history:  "This is a big deal for a lot of reasons one of which is that Biden is only the second Catholic to occupy the White House after John Kennedy. But JFK was never denied communion because he always went to confession after banging Marilyn Monroe." like all Christians Trump believes marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman and another woman after that and then another woman after that and also a paid-off porn actress and other women both willing and unwilling. but sure let's deny communion to Joe Biden — Jeff Tiedrich (@itsJeffTiedrich) June 21 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
