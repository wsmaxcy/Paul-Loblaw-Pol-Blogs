C, Kamala Harris and Other Leftists Spring Rapist From Jail, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-01, In the wake of last Summer’s devastating riots in Minneapolis and St. Paul Hollywood celebrities and left-wing politicians led by Kamala Harris joined forces to bail out violent criminals who committed arson looting and other felonies. But apparently there were not enough such criminals to go around–not enough who got arrested anyway–so the Hollywood/D.C. leftists bailed out everyone in sight. Along with other victims one or more Minnesota women have now suffered kidnapping and assault as a result of Kamala Harris’s largesse: A twice-convicted rapist who was bailed out of jail by the Minnesota Freedom Fund last summer after being charged in two new cases involving sexual assault kidnapping and assault is now wanted on a felony warrant for failing to comply with conditions of his release according to court records. It’s a classic. A known rapist is bailed out by liberals commits new sex crimes in violation of the terms of his bail but cannot now be found. Nice work Kamala! Alpha News reported last March that level 3 sex offender Christopher Don Boswell was facing 10 felony charges in two new cases both of which included kidnapping and third-degree assault. Other charges in the cases included second-degree criminal sexual conduct second-degree assault and threats of violence. Boswell now 38 had been previously convicted in two separate sexual assault cases one with an unknown female teen and another with a known adult female. Boswell used force threats and weapons to gain compliance from his victims in those cases according to information from the Minnesota Department of Corrections.  This is exactly the sort of person whom Kamala Harris and Hollywood celebrities want to be freed to prey on more victims. Following charges last year in the two new cases Boswell remained in custody for several months on high bail amounts until the Minnesota Freedom Fund paid $350000 to bail him out according to a Fox 9 report last August. Recent court records indicate that a felony warrant was issued for Boswell’s arrest on Feb. 11 in one of the cases following a conditional release violation report and an order revoking Boswell’s interim conditions of release. At the time of this publication Boswell remains at large on the warrant in that case in which he is charged with two counts of kidnapping two counts of threats of violence and second and third-degree assault. Good going Kamala! Who cares about a few women who are kidnapped and sexually assaulted when there are political points to be scored for the Democratic Party? Certainly not rich powerful liberals like Kamala Harris. That is pretty much the story of our times. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
