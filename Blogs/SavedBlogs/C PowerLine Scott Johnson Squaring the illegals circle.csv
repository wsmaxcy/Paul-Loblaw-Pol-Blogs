C, Squaring the illegals circle, Scott Johnson, 2021-03-02, As the Biden administration invites waves of illegal immigrants to come on up from points south it has to square a few circles. One of them is the public health dimension of the influx. Politico reported a story yesterday that bears on the public health dimension of the invasion: “White House: Biden not considering sharing Covid vaccine with Mexico.” Think about it. Something’s gotta give. In the video below Jill (“Dr. Edith”) Biden comes to the aid of Joe (“I’ve got half a mind to be president”) Biden’s aid when he forgets all his lines on the administration’s current approach to dealing with the invasion. This too is illustrative of the circle squaring effort. Something’s gotta give. lots to unpack in this 1-minute clip from @UniNoticias:1. Biden suggests he's merely reopening Trump's detention center2.
