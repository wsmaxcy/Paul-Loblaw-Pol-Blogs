L, It’s a Crime, Joyce Siegel, 2021-06-30, Maya Angelou said:”Open your eyes to the beauty around you and do what you can to preserve it.”Well we we’ve been given this earth but it certainly looks like all of us don’t really deserve it.Because of human activity glaciers are melting and oceans are risingbut we’re abusing our planet  so  this isn’t surprising.Over-consumption waste abuse and greedand ignoring others who are  so terribly in need….How can we reverse this destructive directionwith meaningful actions not just talk and reflection?There are the steps each person can take.There are decisions we all have to make.We’re getting close to “now or never” time.We have got to stop this existential crime.6/30/21
