The Southeast Asian kingdom has seen COVID-19 cases surge since February when an outbreak was first detected among its Chinese expatriate community Authorities said last week that hospitals in Phnom Penh were running out of beds and that they had transformed schools and wedding party halls into treatment centres while Hun Sen threatened quarantine-breakers with jail time. 📚📙📒📱🌏 Myanmar-ASEAN: The ongoing events in Myanmar with daily demonstrations and some sporadic armed resistence emerging regional  intergovernmental ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) has finally got round to discussing the situation and possible remedies. Given the basic precept of non-interference coda built into the organizations principles it is not likely that anything substantial will emerge. Previously coups among the member nations have been ignored with simplie statements calling for peace.  However this is the first time the organization has ventured beyond its usual response. Over at The Diplomat coverage of the news and implications Special ASEAN Summit on Myanmar Set for April 24 April 24 has been confirmed as the date for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ long-promised emergency meeting on the crisis in Myanmar. The news was broken on Thursday by Thai PBS World which noted that leaders from all 10 ASEAN states including Myanmar’s coup leader Sen. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing are scheduled to attend the mini-summit in Jakarta. Plans for a special ASEAN meeting have been in the works for some weeks spearheaded by Indonesia and its foreign minister Retno Marsudi whose diplomatic push has been supported by Malaysia Brunei and Singapore. The governments of Malaysia and Brunei announced that a meeting was planned on April 5 following a meeting between Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and Hassanal Bolkiah the sultan of Brunei which currently holds the rotating chairmanship of the Southeast Asian bloc. In a statement the two leaders claimed that “it remains in ASEAN’s greater interest to see Myanmar resolve the crisis and regain stability.” The statement also expressed its customary concern for the deteriorating situation inside the country and “urged all parties to refrain from instigating further violence and for all sides to immediately exercise utmost restraint and flexibility.” 📙📒✒ US-China: Secretary Kerry set to visit China in his Climate Change Thing role. This taking place in the backdrop of rising anti-China rhetoric and policy stance from the US government. Stated US vision is that China is a hostile competitor which has the neoliberals aroused.  A refreshingly different perspective and analysis of the proposed visit appears in Modern Diplomacy titled Kerry’s China Visit: ‘A Weasel Paying a New Year Call to a Chicken A section in the international press claims the US climate envoy John Kerry’s mid-week Shanghai visit was aimed at the White House “wooing Beijing” before the upcoming Earth Summit on April 22. But some foreign commentators while not disagreeing see Kerry’s task as arduous. Then there are those who no doubt believe the visit to be an essential part of Biden’s “climate diplomacy” and as a “bright spot” in tension-ridden China-US relations. Not unexpectedly Beijing has mandated Xie Zhenhua China’s “environment man” and Kerry’s old buddy to go by the script and stick to protocols while hosting his US visitor. On April 13 the US State Department website claimed the President’s special climate envoy John Kerry will be visiting Shanghai and Seoul from April 14 -17. The agenda for the visit was mentioned as to conduct consultations on global climate crisis. Seasoned diplomatic affairs commentators in Beijing sensed something odd in the sudden state department announcement. Li Guangman a veteran IR analyst and widely respected “influencer” in the arena of foreign policy opined: “The fact that the news was released only after Kerry departed for Shanghai is an indication it was perhaps only a last-minute decision in Beijing to host Kerry. This also shows Beijing could have declined the visit too.” 📚✒📙📒🌏 Libya: Collapse of Libya and decades long civil war fell into the usual absence of coverage in main news and the crisis and tragedy that is Libya. Hubris? Arrogance? idiocy? or carelessness?. Over at Counter Punch a revist and a reflective look at demonization propping up taking down and various tools of state craft deployed in this article  Libya: What a Khazi Just in case they’re short on historical examples of Western perfidy the leaders of ‘rogue states’ around the world need remember just one name when they’re courted by the ‘civilized’ West: Gaddafi. The deceased Libyan ruler’s downfall has been an axiomatic argument against making concessions ever since. The lawless Libyan mess has turned into a highly efficient migrant funnel which has facilitated right-wing rhetoric in a Europe that appears to have forgotten why the UN refugee conventions were instituted. No doubt Europol focus groups are telling representatives that ethics don’t sell. Libya is a textbook example of Western hubris where ‘decisive’/’surgical’ violence is labelled ‘humanitarian’ though followed by Stone-Age living conditions and warlordism. It’s taken ten years to finally fix an agreed a date for new elections due in December but the social legacy of the Western intervention will take much longer to heal. In the decade that Libya has been a deadly place to live migration from Africa to Europe has risen sharply. Sub-Saharan applications for asylum in Europe were barely 50000 in 2010 but close to 170000 in 2017. Most transited via Libya. Libya’s hundreds of miles of coastline effectively unpoliced was an own goal in the classic Western mold: (‘We had to destroy the town to save it.’). 📚📙📒🔊🐾🌏💫 Australia: Over at Al jazeera a long(ish) and thoughtful article exploring refugee experience well worth reading ‘I still have nightmares’: Surviving Australia’s Kangaroo Point Brisbane Australia – In the early hours of the morning security guards at an inner-city motel and serviced apartment complex in Brisbane would begin knocking on each door. They were conducting a headcount checking that everyone was still inside their room and still alive just as they had every day since the start of 2019. This was Brisbane’s Kangaroo Point Central Hotel & Apartments a makeshift immigration detention centre which the Australian government terms “an alternative place of detention” (APOD). Until this week it had been used to confine people like 32-year-old Iraqi Ahmad Albardan and other refugees and asylum seekers who were detained at either of Australia’s offshore processing facilities – Nauru and Manus Island both around 4000km from Australia’s shores – but had been sent to Australia for medical treatment under the country’s now repealed medevac law. Last week 19 men who were still being held at this centre after more than a year were suddenly transferred to the Brisbane Immigration Detention Centre (BITA). Thankfully says Ahmad 50 others – himself included – had already been released from Kangaroo Point in March. 📙📒✒🚰 Global: Over at SCMP an opinion piece looking beyond the Covid-19 recovery Curry is British pizza is Japanese: Asia can grow fat on the West’s post-lockdown appetite LIVE TO EAT Emerging from various forms of lockdown around the world and fed up with cooking at home one of the first things many people will want to do is go back to their favourite restaurants.
