L, Notable reactions to Biden's Historic Address to Congress. Including yours., AKALib, 2021-04-28, It was a speech like no other. It was a setting like no other. It had a backdrop like no other. It had a President like no other. It was inspiring it was matter-of-fact it was short on drama but it was long on policies solutions and a vision of the future for the American people. Let’s read the pundits. When a president addresses Congress flanked by the vice president and speaker of the house it's tradition. When both of those seats are filled by women it's history in the making.https://t.co/gRp8CKF6Ku What a historic and beautiful sight!

And class and sophistication. Normally she’s the one grading but tonight Dr. B is getting an A+ pic.twitter.com/3jMPCJ4CwY A momentous day for women and girls. Last night was a momentous occasion. Our presence sent a wide message: the sky is the limit for women and girls.Equally important was President Biden's speech which was a triumph for women: for women in the workplace and for women at home for VAWA for equal pay and more! pic.twitter.com/LGSckBroKh A very apt description of Biden and his administration. President Biden such a decent experienced and serious man. Surrounded by extremely competent and honest Cabinet. He has a grand and coherent vision that he will be hard pressed to deliver. Needs to keep his eye on win for 2022 and 2024 elections. https://t.co/lwMg3r7kLu Foreign policy is lot more than trade and wars. President Biden’s speech is an opportunity to advertise the United States to the world. Today he’s showing the US can change can vaccinate can embrace education and clean tech and do it without being authoritarian. A powerful message as US-China competition defines our times Science is back. These first 100 days have been marked by tremendous progress. @POTUS has restored science across government & renewed U.S. leadership abroad. Nowhere is this more apparent than in efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Imagine what can be achieved with strong legislative action. America is back. Congratulations to President Joe Biden on a profoundly powerful and visionary speech. America is back and we are going to use the government as an instrument of the common good. https://t.co/7tR9mfXKXR A transforming President for these challenging times. My revered @WilliamsCollege mentor James MacGregor Burns (1918-2014) wrote about importance of having a transforming President — who not only makes deals and solves problems but reforms political-economic system. No doubt that Jim Burns would find Biden a transforming President.  Many people esp. the LGBTQ community had tears in their eye tonight - Technically I had Tim Scott on my television and could hear him making sounds in the form of words but I wasn't really listening because I've been crying for the past 45 minutes over Pres. Biden's speech recognizing me as a human being. We share your feelings whole-heartedly. I’m really enjoying the Biden Administration. 👍🇺🇸 High marks for the authenticity of the speech. Biden told people what he’s done and what he wants to do in clear simple accessible language. His agenda sounded big and ambitious but also practical and doable. Great speech great delivery and I’d bet it was very effective with voters. A President of the people and for the People. How radical! This speech is Biden at his best. Really zeroing in on basic stuff people want — jobs better infrastructure higher wages — stuff that's not sexy but very much what people actually want from government. You can feel GOP blood pressure rising he makes it so hard for them. Look at those approval numbers for the speech! *CBS News Poll of Speech Watchers*We interviewed watchers immediately after the speech. More than eight in 10 of those who watched approve of Biden’s speech.Most said it made them feel optimistic about America. pic.twitter.com/QOkI0PoVuo Pete Souza has a sharp eye! According to polls the only Americans who didn’t like President Biden’s speech were the Republican members of Congress sitting on their ass in the House chamber. How did the GOP rebut this much appreciated speech? With the usual mix of nonsense steeped in hate and alt-reality. Tim Scott delivered a speech mostly focused on bizarre claims that Joe Biden is divisive & disinformation like claiming Biden inherited a country that had already rounded the bend on covid.
