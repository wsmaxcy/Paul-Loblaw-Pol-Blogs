L, Jerry Falwell Jr. Encourages COVID-19 Vaccinations With The Weirdest Selfie Flex, Lee Moran, 2021-04-09, Jerry Falwell Jr. urged people to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with a dig at Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. And many Twitter users responded in the same mocking way essentially saying that if “owning the libs” was what it took to vaccinate the country and emerge from the coronavirus pandemic then so be it. “Please get vaccinated so our nutcase of a Governor will have less reasons for mindless restrictions!” Falwell who stepped down as president of the evangelical Liberty University last year amid reports of a sex scandal captioned this selfie on Instagram Thursday: A post shared by Jerry Falwell Jr. (@jerryfalwelljr) “If that’s what it takes then fine lol” replied one person. Others agreed: Honestly if "get vaccinated to own the libs" works go for it https://t.co/Pd8PX0xz61 if that’s what it takes then fine lol Broken clock etc I encourage all Jerry Falwell Jr. fans to get vaccinated so you can own the libs! https://t.co/lKwLA13vrA *sarcastically* Oh no Jerry Falwell Jr. got vaccinated & is encouraging his followers to do the same. I feel SO owned rn. https://t.co/L2c8Dev7eW This is a victory. We agree with Jerry Falwell Jr. Please get vaccinated to own the libs. We will be so owned by reaching herd immunity. https://t.co/ziYFBHcsx9 if this is why people get vaccinated i'm fine with it https://t.co/i5D5czAiZH do it the governor would be so owned https://t.co/IVfpA1e6WY This is a really good argument for getting vaccinated tbqh. Do your part to end lockdowns. https://t.co/Rl3zQwAEUV In all seriousness “Own the libs wear a mask and then we won’t have these mindless restrictions!” was sitting there the whole time and probably would have happened organically if Trump had not staked out an anti-mask stance https://t.co/eBDZv4tfG6 It would own the libs so hard if everyone got the vaccine. Fight cancel culture by getting your shot! https://t.co/EIWchDaylk
