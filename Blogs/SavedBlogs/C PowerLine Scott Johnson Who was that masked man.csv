C, Who was that masked man?, Scott Johnson, 2021-03-09, The New York Post’s Steven Nelson gives a straight news account of President Biden blanking out even as he is reading remarks from a teleprompter stationed in front of him (the Post’s account is accompanied by the video below): President Biden on Monday seemed to forget Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s name at a White House event — calling the Pentagon chief “the guy who runs that outfit over there.” Biden was announcing the nomination of two female generals to lead US military combatant commands. “And I want to thank the sec — the the ah former general. I keep calling him general but my my — the guy who runs that outfit over there” Biden said. “I want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he’s done to try to implement what we just talked about. And for recommending these two women for promotion.” Earlier at the event Biden mentioned the Defense Department leader by his name “Secretary Austin” while appearing to read from a teleprompter. RedState’s Nick Arama provides a more colorful rendition in “Biden’s Incoherence Just Hit Critical Mass This Is Scary Awful.” Arama adds that Biden also “forgets [Secretary Austin’s] position as well as the name of the Pentagon…” Consistent with Nelson’s account that should probably read “seemed to forget” but something here does not compute.   Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
