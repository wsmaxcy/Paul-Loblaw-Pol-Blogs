C, Conspiracy Theories - A Response, chadb, 2020-12-02, There was an article on the homepage today about how conspiracy theories need to stop.  Frankly I feel like the comments are rude and far too dismissive of the attitudes of people we need in order to win elections.  Let me put it another way – if as a group conservatives convince the Joe Cunningham’s of Georgia to sit at home on January 5th are we better off or worse off? Personally I don’t care if you agree with him or not we need to convince him through evidence and sound reasoning.  Otherwise we end up taking conservatives like Joe Cunningham and convincing them to be more like Joe Scarborough. Other side now… I also felt the article itself missed the audience.  This isn’t the Bulwark or Wall Street Journal or CNN.  This is RedState.  Many here feel like the election was stolen.  Without taking sides we should note that those who feel the election was stolen have reasons (including hundreds of sworn affidavits given under penalty of perjury).  Clearly Joe does not believe that the affidavits count as evidence.  Eyewitness testimony is irrelevant in his opinion at least insomuch as it involves people claiming to witness election fraud. How about this alternative sort of article (not a quote but I don’t have a better way to set off the proposal): Many Republicans believe the Democrats stole the Presidential election this year.  I am not one of them.  I don’t think the Democrats running our cities are competent enough to pull off this level of fraud.  However clearly there is enough room in our voting and vote counting process that half of America believes the vote was stolen and more than that believe it is possible to steal a Presidential election.  Even if this election wasn’t stolen the voting process absolutely must be reformed in order to restore confidence in our elections.  While I personally don’t think there were problems this cycle here are some reforms that I believe could restore trust in our elections.  The important thing about these reforms is that they build confidence without disenfranchising voters. There are accusations of election fraud some reasonable and some wild.  If we are ever to restore sanity to our system we need to blah blah blah. This sort of approach recognizes the specific audience you are talking to.  It proposes solutions.  It also does not concede that fraud happened.  You can maintain your lofty position without resorting to finger wagging. I do agree that over the next 4 years of the Biden/Harris administration a focus on “election fraud” will be as effective at winning hearts and minds as the Kavanaugh hearings and impeachment proceedings were for Democrats (and the birther narrative was for Republicans).  We will have to move on with an attitude of “where do we go from here?”  However the only way to accomplish that from within our tent is to acknowledge that I do not rule this tent alone and I do not get to dictate to others what their priorities ought to be.  Instead I meet them with their concerns (election fraud) in a way that takes it seriously almost a “never again” type approach.  This is true even if I don’t agree that fraud occurred  While doing that I also build support for the things near and dear to my own heart (i.e. true educational reform).  If you piss off your readers enough about the stuff they care about then expect them to ignore your concerns. Note – look back through this diary and closely examine whether I took a stance on election fraud.  Joe you could have written this.  You could have posted this and not conceded any of your ground.
