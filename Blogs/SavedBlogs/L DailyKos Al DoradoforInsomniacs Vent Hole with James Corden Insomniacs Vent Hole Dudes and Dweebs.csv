L, Insomniacs' Vent Hole: Dudes and Dweebs, Al DoradoforInsomniacs Vent Hole with James Corden, 2021-04-22,  Rockford Illinois 1974 saw the formation of one of America's well known power-pop bands - Cheap Trick. They became a success with their self-titled debut in which they started off their defining sound; the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of punk rock. The Los Angeles Times proclaimed: "Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier harder more American." — Discogs . 'ELO Kiddies' (1977)  . ‘ELO Kiddies’ is the glammed up lead track from Cheap Trick’s first LP. . In Color is the second Cheap Trick LP. Its cover begins a trend I like to call “Dudes and Dweebs” (or Dorks). Heartthrob band members Robin Zander (Vox) and Tom Petersson (Bass) appear on the front cover while the decidedly less sexy members Bun E. Carlos (Drums) and Rick Nielsen (Guitar) appear on the back cover. The In Color cover is clever; color/black and white motorcycles/mopeds dudes/dweebs. . 'Come On Come On' (1977) . Cheap Trick At Budokan has another “dudes and dweebs” cover which I consider the most egregious of the bunch. Once again Robin and Tom are on the front with Rick and Bun E. on the back. What’s with the back though? Couldn’t take one picture that included both of ‘em? Maybe one or both wanted an individual close up picture who knows? . 'I Want You To Want Me (Live)' (1978) . Hey look at that! Fourth LP (third studio LP) Heaven Tonight with another “dudes and dweebs” cover. It’s a bit hard to tell if both pictures are even from the same photo shoot but I think they are. Yo Rick! It’s kinda nasty to brush your teeth in the men’s room. Just sayin’. . 'Surrender' (1978) . Finally on Dream Police (the band’s fifth LP) the whole gang is back together on the front cover putting an end to the “dudes and dweebs” streak of album covers. . 'Dream Police' (1979) .
