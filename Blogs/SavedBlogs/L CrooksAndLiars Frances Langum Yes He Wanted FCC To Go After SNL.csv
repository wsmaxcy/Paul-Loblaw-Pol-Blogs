L, Yes He Wanted FCC To Go After SNL, Frances Langum, 2021-06-22, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  It's true.  The former so-called president wanted "his" Federal Communications Commission  to find a way to sanction Saturday Night Live for their satire of his administration.  What a stupid snowflake abuse of power move.   If you thought it was just the tweets...    ...it wasn't.   The Daily Beast quotes one Trump legal adviser:   ...when they briefly discussed this with Trump more than two years ago they made a point of saying that the Justice Department in particular doesn’t handle these matters anyway. Trump seemed disappointed to hear that there was no actual legal recourse or anything that the FCC or DOJ could do to punish late-night anti-Trump comedy. “Can something else be done about it?” Trump replied according to this source to which they responded with some version of “I’ll look into it.” (This person says that to this day they have not in fact “looked into it.”) so many (post-presidency) trump stories are basically this meme https://t.co/jLtHUCBH4l pic.twitter.com/K3h43sOT3Z — Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) June 22 2021  For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
