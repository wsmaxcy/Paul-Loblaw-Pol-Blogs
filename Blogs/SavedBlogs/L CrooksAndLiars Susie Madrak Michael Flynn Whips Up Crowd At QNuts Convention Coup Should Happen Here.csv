L, Michael Flynn Whips Up Crowd At QNuts Convention: Coup 'Should Happen Here', Susie Madrak, 2021-05-31, Ladies and gentlemen: Now that he's off the hook with a presidential pardon Trump's former national security advisor is free to whip up extremist crowds with inflammatory rhetoric like this! Via Business Insider:  Michael Flynn who served as President Donald Trump's national security adviser told a crowd at a QAnon conference in Dallas Texas this weekend that the US should have a coup like the one in Myanmar. On February 1 Myanmar's military overthrew its democratically elected government and arrested its leaders. The coup immediately sparked protests across the country prompting the junta to launch a campaign against its own citizens. Upwards of 800 Burmese people including at least 40 children have been killed according to Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. More than 4000 people have been arrested. But sure that's exactly what we need here. God help us. From in front. Here is the video of former national security advisor Michael Flynn saying that he thinks a coup like the coup in Myanmar should happen in the US. pic.twitter.com/7mGYjfXg18 â€” Mamie ðŸ˜Œ (@MC_Hyperbole) May 30 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
