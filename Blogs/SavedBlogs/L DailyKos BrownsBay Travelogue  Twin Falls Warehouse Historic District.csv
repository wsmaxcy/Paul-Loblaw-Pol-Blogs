L, Travelogue:  Twin Falls Warehouse Historic District, BrownsBay, 2021-07-05, Twin Falls Idaho Twin Falls lies on the broad Snake River Plain of south-central Idaho in the Magic Valley a name that exudes boosterism.  It’s a fair sized city by Idaho standards with a population of 48951 being the eighth largest city in Idaho.  I would likely not choose to visit Twin Falls on purpose.  But I was here on a quick job assignment.  I set myself to learn a few things about Twin Falls with the little time I had.  Twin Falls got its kick start when irrigation came and the sagebrush plains were cleared for farming.  The rich windblown soil (loess) was fertile.  It just needed water.  The water was there in the Snake River.  It needed only a way to get to the fields.  The impetus for that was the Carey Act of 1894 which was intended to a create partnerships between private investment state supervision and local management to bring thousands of acres of federal land into agricultural production.   With that the Twin Falls Land and Water Company was formed in 1900 to provide water to 200000 acres south of the Snake River.  Milner Dam and the canal system were completed in 1905.  Twin Falls became the regional commerce center as it remains today with agriculture and related industries as the driver.  The Twin Falls Warehouse Historic District is a group of commercial buildings from those early days.  The District is on the National Register of Historic Places. I explored a small portion of the District on a clear warm late spring evening.  Fascinating to walk among the old buildings trying to read the ghost signs and imagining a bustling commercial district.  Not a soul was found as I walked freely among the buildings except a feral cat.  The following are photos and  Sanborn Map of the Simpson and Company building a reinforced concrete building built in 1916 (number 30 on the index map) .  The next photos and Sanborn Map are of the Swift and Company Poultry and Creamery building a reinforced concrete building built in 1926 (number 19 on the index map).     From the National Register Form (1996) Constructed in 1926 this building is associated with the poultry egg and dairy business in Twin Falls. The entry of Swift and Company in the Twin Falls agricultural market coincided with the establishment of a plant for the Idaho Egg Producers Association with both entities' having processing facilities and offering local farmers access to regional markets for dairy and poultry produce. Initially Swift and Company made butter and cheese sold eggs and processed poultry at this plant and incorporated a cheese manufacturing department in 1934 so that local producers had a market year around for whole milk. The company added a chick hatchery in 1936 and a poultry-turkey hatchery in 1940. By 1949 the Twin Falls plant ceased the egg and butter business and instead concentrated on poultry and cheese. An article in the local newspaper stated that the poultry could be "picked dressed and in ice in 20 minutes" owing to an efficient assembly line processafter which the chickens were packed in ice and shipped to various points throughout the Intermountain region. (Turkeys were processed elsewhere but returned to the plant for shipping.)  The same article also stated that the hatchery was the largest in Idaho hatching about 27000 chicks twice a week and selling a million baby chicks to growers in 1953. The next photos and Sanborn Map are of the Globe Seed and Feed Company (number 22 on the index map).   From the National Register Form (1996) … Globe was the "largest shipper of certified seed grains in Idaho if not the entire west" and that the company shipped Twin Falls agricultural products to an international market. Doors windows and ghost signs.      Have you been to Twin Falls?  Have you lived in Twin Falls?  I was just a lone traveler passing through.  I welcome any comments observations and discussion.  Bibliography: Egleston Elizabeth.  1996.  Twin Falls Warehouse Historic District — National Register of Historic Places Registration Form.  National Park Service — United States Department of the Interior.
