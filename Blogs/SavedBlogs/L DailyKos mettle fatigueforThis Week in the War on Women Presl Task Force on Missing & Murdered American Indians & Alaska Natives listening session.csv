L, Pres'l Task Force on Missing & Murdered American Indians & Alaska Natives listening session, mettle fatigueforThis Week in the War on Women, 2021-04-29,     Trigger Warning: This post contains information that discusses violence against Indigenous women.  Maybe you’ve seen the hashtag #MMIW on social media or its counterpart #MMIWG2. Both stand for Missing and Murdered Indigenous women the latter adding on G2 for Girls and Two-Spirits. The hashtag was created to spread awareness for a generations-long silent epidemic that has stolen the lives of Indigenous Women Girls and Two-Spirits across Turtle Island (North America).  The hashtag was created to give voice to women whose stories have not been heard.  It is shocking that Indigenous women are murdered at a rate 10 times higher than the national average (U.S. Department of Justice) and homicide is one of the leading causes of death for young Indigenous women (3rd for women age 10-24 5th for 25-44) yet many Americans are unfamiliar with the prevalence of the issue.  In a publication from the Minnesota Law Review Marie Quasius explained that “Native American women suffer sexual assault at a much higher rate and with more serious consequences than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. Further such rapes are overwhelmingly committed by individuals outside the Native American community.”  The history of violence against Indigenous women can literally be traced back to the arrival of Europeans and Christopher Columbus who treated Native peoples as a problem to be extinguished and who engaged in the murder sex trade and rape of Indigenous men and women…. There are a few reasons why the issue of #MMIW continues to persist.  1) Lack of media coverage. A study from the Urban Indian Health Initiative that examined #MMIW cases found that 95% were not covered by national or international news media.  2) Complicated jurisdiction in Native Nations. Entire books have been written on this topic but it undoubtedly has led to many #MMIW cases being overlooked or under-investigated.  In a 2019 interview with Alaskan Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski CNN writers Scott McLean and Sara Weisfeldt described that “many women disappear from remote reservations -- some that lack even a single police officer. Other times cases get lost in a confusing web of jurisdictional conflicts between tribal local and state police. She [Murkowski] also worries that some victims are simply discounted because of their race or involvement in prostitution.”  3) Rural setting of Native communities. 4)<big> Extractive [gold diamonds lumber coal oil gas uranium rare earths etc] male-dominated industries near Native communities.</big> In an article for Greenpeace Kaitlin Grable noted that <big>environmentally damaging industries such as mining logging and fossil fuels are to account for “some of the largest perpetuating factors of violence trafficking and murder against Indigenous women. They bring an influx of transient male workers to rural areas often near Reservations where they live in ‘man camps.’ In North Dakota the Bakken ‘oil boom’ and resulting arrival of thousands of workers to the area brought with it a surge in rates of violent crime and aggravated assault. The state had at least 125 cases of missing Indigenous women during this time — though in reality the numbers are likely much higher than that because data on Indigenous women is often reported incorrectly or not collected at all.”</big>… —https://sicangucdc.org/blog/f/mmiw-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_and_murdered_Indigenous_women  For almost a decade hundreds of red dresses have been hung on college campuses and outside state capitols from freeway overpasses and in front yards all over the United States and Canada. Gina Mosbrucker can’t get the images of them out of her head. The dresses symbolize and spotlight the thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls (MMIWG). As Washington State Representative for the 14th Legislative District Mosbrucker R-Goldendale and a 1988 Clark alumna is doing her part to help find them—starting with two state House bills she cosponsored with Rep. Mia Gregerson D-SeaTac signed into law by Gov. Jay Inslee in April. The National Crime Information Center states that in 2016 there were 5712 reports of missing Native American and Alaska Native women and girls in the nation. But only 116 of them entered were in the U.S. Department of Justice’s database for missing persons—called NamUs—reports the Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI). In an article for the New York Times writer Jack Healy described that there are several reasons why women go unreported or are reported incorrectly describing that “women are often misclassified as Hispanic or Asian or other racial categories on missing-persons forms and that thousands have been left off a federal missing-persons database.” The misreporting leads to an understatement of the magnitude of the issue. <big>5) Lack of funding for Native law enforcement.</big> As a result Healy explained that “The crisis has turned families into search parties and parents into private detectives. They draw grids across rural reservations and fan out through chaparral and sagebrush. They crack into their children’s social media accounts to search for a telltale direct message.”  <big>6) Lack of database/tracking to understand the scope.</big> It’s only been in the past couple of years that advocates have begun to comprise databases in attempt to correct log cases of #MMIW that haven’t been recognized or properly accounted for. In 2018 UIHI researched and compiled a database of 5717 missing Alaska Native and American Indian women and girls. Among those thousands only 116 were listed in the database owned by the Department of Justice.  — https://www.clarkcollegefoundation.org/indigenous-tragedy/.
