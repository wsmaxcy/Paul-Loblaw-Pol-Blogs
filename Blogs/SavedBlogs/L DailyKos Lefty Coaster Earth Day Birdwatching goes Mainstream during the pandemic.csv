L, Earth Day: Birdwatching goes Mainstream during the pandemic, Lefty Coaster, 2021-04-21, This was a segment of the Today show from this morning.   When I moved to the island 28 years ago I didn’t realize I was relocating to one of the country’s premier birdwatching hot spots. This winter it was a destination for birdwatchers hoping to see our Short Eared Owls. Now I realize my diverse and and abundant avian neighbors are one of the best things about living where I do. The wildlife refuge I overlook has 237 species of birds recorded. Where else can a trip to the store involve passing four Bald Eagles lined up in a row atop four utility poles?  Avian behavior is festinating. My yard includes four large hedges that are bird condos. My next door neighbor has a line of seed feeders along my property line.  So there is a lot of avian activity to watch. Now I see a lot of matting displays as well as numerous mattings. I think I have the most popular birdbath around. It’s in constant use.
