L, IAN:  May 2 2021 - Ah yes.  My favorite song from Camelot, loggersbratforItzl Alert Network, 2021-05-01,   As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos.  It's also so we can find other Kossacks nearby for in-person checks when other methods of communication fail - a buddy system. Members come here to check in.  If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we and your buddy are going to check up on you.  If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here.  We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries.  Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime!  We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group!  Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! ************************* They’ve found another ancient potter’s fingerprint. Restorationists urge Jill Biden to erase Melania Trump’s Rose Garden makeover. A boat made of stones found in an Icelandic cave.  It apparently had something to do with an eruption not long after Iceland was settled. Alaska finally has a crime scene investigator. Somebody’s studying cancer rates in medieval Britain. A Chinese girl abandoned for being an albino is now a rising star among models. Laser scans are providing much new information on Mayan civilization. ************************* The ebony cane is 34” the oak one is 36”.  I’m in the middling tall range to use one and the middling short range for the other.  I think I’m going to use the shorter one more often — it will function better as a potential weapon. Yes 25 years in the poorer areas of Los Angeles did leave a mark.  Why do you ask? Having mentioned the weapons potential to my firstborn I think I will not have to listen to any more remarks on my being too old to deal with a stickshift. ************************* I was running low on something I only know to find on Amazon so I ordered more.  It was mailed on April 17th (after being ordered a week before) from Ithaca NY to Mulino OR (which is a little town I’d never even heard of before a county or two south of Portland) then to Portland and as of Wednesday was in the USPS San Diego Distribution Center.  Oh joy.  Or should I say Oh DeJoy.  Somebody there had a fit of efficiency because I received it on Thursday. ************************* I’ve been using the ebony cane and I can move a lot faster with it than without.  It was the other one that came with understandable instructions so I think I’m going to get my money’s worth from both. And yes I do plan to continue using a cane for the style of it when I don’t need it for support.  I’m already a hat person and have been for years. *************************
