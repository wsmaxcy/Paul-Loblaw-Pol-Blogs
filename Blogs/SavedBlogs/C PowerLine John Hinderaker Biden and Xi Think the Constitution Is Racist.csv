C, Biden and Xi Think the Constitution Is Racist, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-17, Yesterday an intrepid reporter asked the insufferable Jen Psaki about U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s assertion that America’s founding documents are white supremacist. Doesn’t that echo Chinese Communist propaganda as in the recent diplomatic debacle in Anchorage? Does Joe Biden intend to fire Thomas-Greenfield? And the most salient question: does Biden share her contempt for America’s founding documents i.e. the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence? It takes some doing but the answer to that last question is Yes: The White House is now supporting the Chinese Communist Party line that our founding documents are racist. It cannot be overstated how disgusting this is. pic.twitter.com/ULL4CXl4b1 — Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) April 16 2021  
I found it revealing that Psaki’s first words were to the effect that Thomas-Greenfield is a black woman. So how can anyone disagree with or criticize her? Hey Jen: Candace Owens is a black woman too. Somehow I don’t think your reverence for that combination runs as deep as you suggest. The dominant elements of our political class hate our country. And our schools are run by people who hate our country–the public schools and even more so the “elite” private ones. Also it seems most of our major corporations which are after all global. Has any country ever survived such an onslaught from within? I doubt it. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
