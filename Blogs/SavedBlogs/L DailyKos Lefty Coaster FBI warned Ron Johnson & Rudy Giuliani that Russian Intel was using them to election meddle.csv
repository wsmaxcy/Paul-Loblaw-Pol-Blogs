L, FBI warned Ron Johnson & Rudy Giuliani that Russian Intel was using them to election meddle, Lefty Coaster, 2021-04-29, It appears the FBI tried to warn Rudy Giuliani and Ron Johnson that they were being manipulated by Russian Intelligence agencies. Russia Ron Johnson disregarded the FBI’s warning and denies ever discussing it.    According to the Post Giuliani was warned about Russia's attempts to meddle in the election but he proceeded with a planned trip to Ukraine where we met with a Ukrainian lawmaker whom the U.S. government in 2019 labeled as “an active Russian agent." Then-national security adviser Robert O’Brien warned Trump that any information Giuliani brought back from Ukraine should be considered contaminated by Russia. Johnson was also briefed on Russia’s attempts last summer as he was already investigating President Biden’s dealings with Ukraine while he was vice president when his son Hunter Biden held a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. According to the Post Johnson didn’t take any mind to the warning and said Thursday that there was no substance to his meeting with U.S. intelligence officials. If Ron Johnson had any decency he would resign in disgrace.
