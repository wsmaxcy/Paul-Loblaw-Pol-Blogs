L, My Mel Brooks Story, Rule of Claw, 2021-06-29, Yesterday was the King of Comedy’s 95th Birthday.  I would have posted this yesterday but I wanted to get out an important story on southwest drought and posted that before I realized it was Mel’s birthday. But about 19 years ago in a Schnuck’s market near Clayton MO I met Mr. Brooks.  We were checking out and just then our checker lost it.  She started turning red and giggling and jumping up and down.  I asked her what was going on and she just kept giggling and saying “It’s him!”  “Who?” I asked. “It’s Mel Brooks!” she yelled.  I just then realized that he had a show in town the Producers I think and I told her to go say hi we will wait.  She said she was too nervous not sure if she was allowed to all the usual things people tell themselves that end up later being recounted on a barstool marked “what-if.” So being me I did what I thought was right.  I was dressed for success so I sauntered over to Mr. Brooks and said the following or something very close:  “Mr. Brooks my name is Todd.  Now I have tremendous respect for you and understand you are busy but you would just about make this young woman’s entire life if you would take a few seconds to go say hi.” Mel smiled immediately and said  “Lead me to her.” Mel walked up to this young checker and said hi and talked to her for a good two minutes which is a lot in celebrity time where she started crying and smiling and exhibiting all sorts of emotion I could only describe as pure joy. At the end he said he had to go but there was one more thing and he pulled out two tickets to that night’s show he just happened to have.  She started to take them then said she didn’t know if she could get off.  Mel is naturally funny and he started to point to the scanner then looked to me and asked “Todd can you do this young lady’s job for the night?” I was floored.  I said if Schnuck’s will allow me to for you and her Mel absolutely.  Luckily the crowd that formed included her manager who told her Becky I think her name was but it has been a while that if need be she would personally take care of her line.  Go.  Go. She just kept saying it over and over.  She took the tickets and Mr. Brooks gave her the biggest hug you could ever imagine.  Then he goes to me and says “Thank you for introducing me to her stuff like this makes this crazy life worth it.” Then Mel and I guess his manager walk off out of the store into a stretch limousine into the afternoon.  Next thing I know the young checker gives me a huge hug that I could only describe as pure love.  My fiance now wife who previously had been getting some snacks for the road walked up to see me introducing Mel Brooks to this young woman and was to say the least well let’s just say that “well-dressed fiance randomly introducing one of the titans of comedy to a checker while she was looking for Doritos” was not on her bingo card. I can honestly tell you I have never seen a person so happy in their life as when this young lady met Mel Brooks.  And I can tell you without question Mel Brooks presented himself as a treasure. -ROC Hey friends my cancer fight has turned more serious and has forced me to urgently change careers!  And-huge news!  My newsletter is live! Sign up here to subscribe!  It publishes every Wednesday and will be full of original reporting laughs and fun!
