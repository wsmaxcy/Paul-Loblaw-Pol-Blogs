L, The Curious Case of Morally Bankrupt Republicans, TheCarter, 2021-05-01, In 2016 when Donald J. Trump came into power it became crystal clear that we will have to tolerate an army of jokers leaded by him. This special breed is called Republicans and they wear Trumpism on their sleeves with only one agenda in life â€“ How to bring Trump back into power. However that is almost impossible now as we have a very deserving President in the White House. But that does not mean the Republicans would stop trying January 2021 insurrection of the Capitol is one such example. They can turn into rioters on just one call of Trump and proved if they cannot permanently dominate this country with their fascist ideology they are ready to blow it up. Stunned? For a Republican Donald Trump is no less than God which means he can never lie never make any mistake he is perfect. Social media is crowded with this segment who fight battles for their cult leader and are willing to go to any extent to justify his decisions. The Republicans are a morally bankrupt people that supported a dangerous President who was hell bent on our destroying our democracy simple because they cannot stand equal opportunities for people of color and would do anything to keep them from progressing. According to Republicans homosexuals do not deserve equal rights. This comes from their religious beliefs and they think people of LGBTQ community should be treated differently. They believe homosexuals should not be allowed to marry or adopt children. Homophobia comes naturally to a Republican and they have been resisting trans rights since generations. Republicans must be mindless or blind to be in denial. Their favorite political cult leader Trump stole tens of millions of dollars from his own donors and still they remain loyal to him. They voted for a misogynist who had a history of sexually assaulting young women and expected fellow Americans to do the same. Thankfully the conservatives are shrinking in numbers and that helped us get rid of a sexist President. I genuinely believe conservatives and morals cannot co-exist. We must defend an open democratic society against these fascist forces known as the Republicans who encourage violence sexism racism homophobia etc. Power means everything to them and they would do anything to retain it even if they have to unleash deadly riots like the they did in the Capitol.
