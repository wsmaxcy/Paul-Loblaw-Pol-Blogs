L, The further digital lynching of Maxine Waters, Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-04-20, Yesterday Congress Woman Maxine Waters managed to ruffle a bunch of feathers she was even discussed during the Derek Chauvin trial when Defense Attorney Eric Nelson claimed that she had “called for violence” and attempted to use her comments to call for a mistrial. The Judge lamented the comments saying he “wished elected representatives would be more respectful” but he did not rule for a mistrial since the Jury had already been told not to watch the news.  He did however grant that her comments may have given the defense grounds for an appeal. Which I think is frankly ridiculous because what she said was this…. I'm going to fight with all of the people who stand for justice. We've got to get justice in this country and we cannot allow these killings to continue. We’re looking for a guilty verdict. If that doesn’t happen then we know we have to stay in the street we’ve got to fight for justice.  I am very hopeful and I hope we’re going to get a verdict that say “Guilty Guilty Guilty.”  If we don’t we can not go away.  Q: What should protestors do? We’ve got to get more active.  We’ve got to get more confrontational and make sure that they know that we mean business.  Nowhere in that statement is a call to violence.  Nowhere in that statement are people or property threatened.  No where does she suggest anything criminal.  She isn’t saying anything that is different from what George Floyd’s family has said in fact some of the witnesses said it from the stand. President Biden has also weighed in on the case and called for a “Guilty” verdict. But by the reaction from the right-wing you’d think that she had set the world on fire. Waters later elaborated on her comments.  “I talk about confronting the justice system confronting the policing that's going on I'm talking about speaking up. I'm talking about legislation. I'm talking about elected officials doing what needs to be done to control their budgets and to pass legislation." So of course she’s been blasted by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. But McCarthy and his far right wing extremists including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went on the attack with Greene saying she wanted to expel Waters. “This weekend in Minnesota Maxine Waters broke the law by violating curfew and then incited violence” McCarthy falsely claimed. “Speaker Pelosi is ignoring Waters' behavior—that's why I am introducing a resolution to censure Rep. Waters for these dangerous comments.” McCarthy’s motion is being seen as pure partisan politics and fundraising fodder. Social media users were furious. The same republican party voted against impeaching Trump for inciting violence and plotting a coup pic.twitter.com/1WaETxwgwa  She didn’t incite or support an insurrection or try to overturn the results of a valid election like you and many members of your caucus did. Nor did she storm the capital. Nor did she kill Americans by disparaging and undermining basic public health measures like wearing masks.  Slap her on the hand if you think you must Kev but you have guilty AF insurrectionists IN CONGRESS STILLGaetzHawleyBoebertBrooksGreeneCruzTime for consequences for those who tried to overthrow democracy https://t.co/QNlPirIHXL  And Marjorie Taylor Greene. In a series of tweets Taylor Greene accused Waters of crossing state lines to incite a riot --- which was also picked up by fellow Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO). The Georgia Republican then announced that she would move to have Waters expelled from Congress this week.  "Maxine Waters told BLM terrorists to "stay on the streets" and "get more confrontational." BLM terrorists took her orders and took action. She should be expelled from Congress." However as Punchbowl reports Greene's move has little chance of success and could boomerang on her as Democrats retaliate by once again seeking her ouster. "This is hardly the first time that Waters 82 has gotten in trouble over her rhetoric. She and Rep. Jim Jordan got into it last week as the Ohio Republican jousted with Dr. Anthony Fauci during a hearing. 'You need to respect the chair and shut your mouth!' Waters yelled at Jordan. During the Donald Trump years Waters became 'Auntie Maxine' for a whole generation of younger Democrats due to her willingness to go after the former president" the report states before adding "An expulsion resolution will not pass the House and Republicans would need to flip three Democrats to censure Waters -- and that seems very unlikely." Lauren Boebert and Matt Geatz. "Why is Maxine Waters traveling to a different state trying to incite a riot? What good can come from this?" Boebert added "She would already be expelled if she were a Republican.' Ted Cruz.  "Democrats actively encouraging riots & violence. They want to tear us apart. Steve Scalise. "I've been very clear in speaking out against any kind of political rhetoric that incites violence" he said. "The fact that Speaker Pelosi covered for her -- she was trying to incite violence and in fact there is violence going on right now in Minnesota because of her actions." "I would like to see Maxine Water apologize for the inflammatory comments that she's made inciting violence" he continued. "It's a powder keg down there. The last thing you want to do is make it worse." And Rudy Giuliani. On Monday former President Donald Trump's longtime ally Rudy Giuliani posted a Twitter rant against Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) accusing her of making a "direct threat" against the jury in the Derek Chauvin trial in Minnesota. Rudy. One question. What did “let’s have trial by combat!” mean? https://t.co/xSshWrFoiY  This. Is. Insanity. The crowd that Maxine Waters spoke to didn’t march to The Capitol infiltrate it cause millions in damage injure over 140 police officers and try to kill the Vice President. For gosh sakes! https://t.co/hChoKXCaPl  But for the record let’s Just remember what Trump said. Trump demanded far more than to "show we mean business." He wanted an election overturned at the U.S. Capitol. He demanded his followers march down to that building and as the New York Times recounted he wasn't about to settle for just being "more active." "We are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women" Trump said "and we are probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them — because you will never take back our country with weakness." "Trump exhorted his supporters "to fight. We will never give up we will never concede" Trump said delighting the crowd by calling Democratic victories the product of what he called "explosions of bullshit." "'Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!' people chanted in reply." Speaker Pelosi on the other hand has defended Waters. When asked whether Waters need to apologize for her comments Pelosi denied the notion according to a Hill pool report on Monday. “No she doesn’t” Pelosi said. “That woman on the floor should be apologizing for what she said.” Asked to specify who the House Speaker was referring to Pelosi said she was unsure. (Pelosi may have been talking about Rep. Lisa McClain (R-MI) who blamed Waters for a drive-by shooting in Minnesota over the weekend.) “I don’t know but she was attributing some murder — some incident that happened after that to Maxine’s statement” Pelosi said according to the Hill pool report. “No Maxine talked about confrontation in the manner of the Civil Rights movement.” The House speaker continued that she personally believes that lawmakers should follow the lead set by George Floyd’s family who Pelosi said handled the protests in the wake of his death with “great dignity and no ambiguity.” Waters shouldn’t feel obligated to apologize she said. Asked by a reporter whether Waters’ comments incited violence Pelosi replied: “No absolutely not.” As has been pointed out there has been no “Riot” following Waters statements.  There was no “mistrial” and I frankly don’t think that a guilty verdict could possibly be overturned based on her statements.  I mean seriously.  All of these people are simply angry at Maxine because she speaks truth particularly when she said this:  U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) is denouncing Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and others who she says are falsely framing her words and trying to have her expelled. Waters the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee who has been in Congress since 1991 says she is not "intimidated" or "afraid" and she will "do what needs to be done." [...] “I am nonviolent" Chairwoman Waters told The Grio. “Republicans will jump on any word any line and try to make it fit their message and their cause for denouncing us and denying us basically calling us violent … any time they see an opportunity to seize on a word so they do it and they send a message to all of the white supremacists the KKK the Oath Keepers the [Proud] Boys and all of that how this is a time for [Republicans] to raise money on [Democrats] backs." “This is a time for [Republicans] to keep telling our constituents that [Democrats] are the enemy and they do that time and time again" Waters said describing the GOP's strategy. “But that does not deter me from speaking truth to power. I am not intimidated. I am not afraid and I do what needs to be done." Of course they have twisted and contorted her actual comments. Of course they have decided to jump up and down and scream that she was “inciting” something or the other this is their go to move. Blowing this all out of proportion while totally minimizing their own behavior and justification for actual violence that really did happen is par for the course. Of course every word they speak is in bad faith. But they aren’t intimidating Auntie Maxine not one bit.  Congressperson Waters is my representative and I couldn’t be more proud of her.   BREAKING: DEREK CHAUVIN IS GUILTY OF ALL COUNTS!!!!!!  JUSTICE!!!!!!! Booyah!   Kevin McCarthy has moved to censure Maxine Waters before Matt Gaetz Marjorie Taylor Greene Lauren Boebert Mo Brooks Madison Cawthorn or the 139 House GOP members who backed sedition (including himself)  The fact that it was so close meaning EVERY. SINGLE. REPUBLICAN. congressperson voted to censure her is fucking disgraceful. https://t.co/5k08UNVIfz
