C, The Geek in Pictures: A Little Climate A Little COVID, Steven Hayward, 2021-02-03, Let’s see what’s in the charts and graphs pile for this week. First up let’s look at some climate and energy-related pics:   Still think we should cut back on fracking Mr. Biden:   Don’t worry—Biden is going to fix this real fast. . .  You know how we keep hearing of the risk of death from climate change? Well never mind. . .   And climate crisis you say?  From the looks of this chart we stink at vaccination. . .  On the other hand when you compare us to Europe. . .  Overall leftist parties keep losing support. It’s a total mystery. . .  I’ll have more to say about this in a separate post one of these days soon.   So the Fed is not the only central bank that knows how to pump up the money supply . . .    Finally from the “miss me yet” Trump file:    Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
