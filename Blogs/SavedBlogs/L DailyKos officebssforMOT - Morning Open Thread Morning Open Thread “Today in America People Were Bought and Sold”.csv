Since this is the final Monday in the month of April which is Black Women’s History Month I think a kind of summing up is due and I can’t think of any poet better suited to the task than Marilyn Nelson who has written many poems based on Black American history her family’s history and her own experiences. Marilyn Nelson (1946 - ) American poet translator educator and children’s author was born in Cleveland Ohio into a military family and spent most of her childhood on a series of military bases.

She must have seenthe darkest eyes in the room brim: The next dayshe gave me a poem she’d chosen especially for meto read to the all except for me white class.She smiled when she told me to read it smiled hardersaid oh yes I could. She smiled harder and harderuntil I stood and opened my mouth to banjo playingdarkies pickaninnies disses and dats. When I finishedmy classmates stared at the floor. We walked silentto the buses awed by the power of words.. “How I Discovered Poetry” from The Fields of Praise: New and Selected Poems © 1994 1995 1996 1997 by Marilyn Nelson - Louisiana State University Press ____________________________ . . by Marilyn Nelson. For Ruben Ahoueya . Today in America people were bought and sold:five hundred for a "likely Negro wench."If someone at auction is worth her weight in goldhow much would she be worth by pound? By ounce?If I owned an unimaginable quantity of wealthcould I buy an iota of myself?How would I know which part belonged to me?If I owned part could I set my part free?It must be worth something—maybe a lot—that my great-grandfather they say killed a lion.They say he was black with muscles as hard as ironthat he wore a necklace of the claws of the lion he'd fought.How much do I hear for his majesty in my blood?I auction myself. And I make the highest bid..

A collective family mythpassed down across generationstakes on the polished gleam of truthand memories become legend..The legend of black sod-busterson a piece of red soil they ownin a township of black ranchers.Their legendary rodeo.. GRAND ENTRY.Two Stars and Stripes flutter intothe arena carried by twomen in jeans red shirts white Stetsons.Guiding their horses with left handsholding the flagstaffs in their rightstheir backs straight and tall their facestheir chestnut faces beautifulin the light of the setting sun.. After them two by twobanners waving hooves raising dustride the Horse People of Boleya varicolored promenade.They canter once around the ringthen they circle into the sky.. MUTTON BUSTING.In the cluster of five-year-oldcontenders wearing life jacketsand bicycle helmets papernumbers safety-pinned to their backsyou line up one by one for a turnto hang on tight with your legs squeezedat the sheep’s broad middle fingersholding handfuls of deep warm woolas the sheep destiny presentsruns you out to cheering applause.Whether you’ll fall on top of itor it on you you won’t fall far.You have no front teeth anywayand a brown clown gone pick you up.. BAREBACK RIDING.This horse was bred and born to buck.He’s a good horse he’ll give you points.Gloved hand in the rigging’s handlebare brown hand waving in the airyou whir your spurs at his shouldersas he leaps twists and jolts your bones.Four seconds or four hundred years.But if you can get up and slapthe dust off your jeans with your hatthe future’s eyes looking at youwill fill with forevering light:light that will make generationsof proud brown people rememberthe Black Horse People of Boley.. BULLDOGGING.In truth there’s seldom a reasonfor a man to wrestle a steerunless he’s a real ranch cowboydealing with ornery power.Maybe while rounding up the herdhe bumps heads with testosteroneand it’s testosterone-vs.-testosterone. Bill Pickett learnedwatching dogs on a Boley ranchthat sometimes you’ve got to bulldoga hardhead with a kiss of pain.Today you slide from horse ontothe fleeing steer grab his horns pullfive hundred pounds of muscle down.. TEAM ROPING CALF ROPING STEER ROPING.Roping always involves a teamwhether it’s two men or womenor one human and one smart horse.The aim: to bring down and hog-tiea big scared baby of a calfor a full-grown and pissed-off steer.You gallop out swinging your loopwith one hand the other holdingthe slack and the unneeded reins.You down him with a careful tosstie three of his hooves togetherstep back with wide arms and a grin.A rope isn’t always a noose:ropes in brown hands can be lassos. . SADDLE BRONC RIDING.It’s not the leather riding glovesand it’s not the fringed buckskin chapsnot the worn-in and dusty bootsnot the spurs’ blunted silver starsnot the 10x wide-brimmed straw hat(both winged helmet and regal crown):it’s not clothes that make the cowboy.It’s something behind a bronzed facein the level gaze from dark eyesand of course it’s heart that puts youthe reins in one hand one hand freewaving with the horse’s rhythmyour heels spurring from neck to flankon this bronc called America. . BARREL RACING.Thunder explodes out of the chute.Mane and tail whip in the speed windagile hooves pound a swift tempocircling around the first barrel.One hand grips the horn the othercommunicates with the taut reinsthough your thighs give the best guidancetelling your horse to maneuverin circles that hug the barrels.Three barrels a tight cloverleafyou gallop through with one joined will.This contest pits you and your horseagainst the clock and your best time.Sister your dreadlocks are flying! . PONY EXPRESS.Before telegraph news traveledfrom mouth to ear from hand to hand.News arrived old. From sea to seatook weeks unless carried by boysstationed along the stagecoach routeto race a cross-country relay.Your pulse gallops toward the handoffwhen your teammate takes the batonand the noise and flurry go onwithout you. Your leg run you andyour horse (your partner your friend) standencompassed in adrenalinwatching as the Ancestors mustunable to help but cheering.. TENNESSEE WALKER.Let’s hear it for the barrel menfor the bullfighters for the clownsfor the men on the side readyto run toward trouble. Give it upfor the musical director(thanks for the hip-hop bro!). And forthe announcer and all the folkscheering in the stands. That babywearing a tiny cowboy hat.That man the same black as his horsein that white suit and fedora.His Tennessee Walker’s proud gaitas he nods to his own rhythmtail an ebony waterfall.. BULL RIDING.Boley bulls are bred for buckingbred to be mean to be “Bad Boys.”They teach you to sit strong hold onand with one hand reach for the sky.After riding a Boley bulla cowboy thinks Hell I’ve been there.I’ve held the bull-rope raked my spurswhile that bad boy tried to kill me.A ton of Brahma seeing redgives you a whole new perspectivea who-you-think-you-talking-tofearlessness. You’ve seen the bull’s eye:you know you can’t die more than once.You’ve lived through eight Mississippis. . “The Boley Rodeo” from Poetry magazine April 2019 issue © 2019 by Marilyn Nelson ____________________________ . .by Marilyn Nelson.Five daughters in the slant light on the porchare bickering.
