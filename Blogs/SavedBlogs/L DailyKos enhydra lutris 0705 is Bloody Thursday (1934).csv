L, 07/05 is Bloody Thursday (1934), enhydra lutris, 2021-07-05, Today is day 186 of the Gregorian Calendar yearSweetmorn Confusion 40 3187 YOLD (discordian)And let us not forget 13.0.8.11.18 mlc (the Mayan Long Count)***** SF General Strike 1934 Bloody Thursday is one of many dates with that name.  (I was even present at one of them but that's another tirade.)  In this case it was something of a transition from the San Francisco/West Coast longshore strike of 1934 into the San Francisco General Strike of 1934. The two strikes in combination lasted 83 days and enshrined Harry Bridges in the pantheon of labor heroes.  Ever since the end of WWI the longshoremen on the entire west coast of the US were without unions or forced to join company unions which had the exact same effect as having no unions at all.   Localized strikes and other attempts at unionization were repressed and suppressed often violently such as the 1923 San Pedro strike where injunctions and mass arrests were accompanied by vigilantism carried out by the American Legion (somehow proudly helping veterans thereby???)  On May 9 1934 longshoremen at every west coast port walked off of the job and went on strike.  The employers refused to negotiate and recruited strikebreakers generally housed in secure places and provided police escorts.  Clashes between striking longshoremen and strikebreakers still broke out and on May 15 police in San Pedro reacted by firing upon the strikers wounding several and killing one further exacerbating the tensions.  The employers having decided  to open the ports by force clashes between police and strikers broke out all along the San Francisco waterfront on July 3.  The strikers took July 4th off because July 4th and all that and resumed the strike on Thursday July 5.  The employers' cabal had decided to further open the port on that day  and used the time honored US strike-breaking tradition of violent assault by the police starting with the police firing tear gas into the crowds of strikers followed by a mounted charge in the morning.  Then in the afternoon the Police attacked the Longshore Association's strike kitchen eventually firing into the crowd killing two and wounding many and followed up by firing into the Association hall and teargassing neighboring buildings. The National Guard was then sent in to patrol the waterfront with the US Army units at the Presidio alerted to standby as reinforcements if needed.  This day Thursday July 5 1934 became known as Bloody Thursday and is honored by Longshoremen to this day.  In fact the ILWU has no doubt shut down all west coast ports for today as in all prior years.  These events followed by a mass funeral procession down Market Street on the 6th that numbered in the thousands created sufficient sympathy for the strikers throughout San Francisco that when Harry Bridges asked the San Francisco Labor Council to meet and authorize a general strike on the 7th they did so as did the Alameda County Central Labor Council (Oakland etc) and the rank and file teamsters in both Oakland and San Francisco who overrode their leadership on the matter.  The "San Francisco General Strike of 1934" began on the 16th and involved the suspiciously round number of 150000 workers.  This was followed by a police rampage on the 17th when the cops arrested about 300 people and methodically trashed offices and meeting halls destroying any furniture and equipment belonging to organizations suspected of participating in the strike in some manner. Four days later the strike was over and in its aftermath a lot of labor concessions were made and a lot of government police and private terrorism against the nascent unions and their supporters was committed.  However it was also followed by a long string of assorted lesser strike actions up and down the west coast which were honored by the longshoremen and teamsters  In the end all of the west coast ports became unionized Also Today just remember that there's no musubi like Spam musubi  On this day in history: 1594 – Portuguese forces began an unsuccessful invasion of the Kingdom of Kandy1610 – John Guy and 39 other colonists set sail from Bristol for Newfoundland.1687 – Isaac Newton published Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.1807 – In Buenos Aires the local militias repelled the Second English Invasion.1934 – Police opened fire on striking longshoremen in San Francisco.1935 – The National Labor Relations Act was signed into law by FDR1937 – Spam was put on the market by Hormel 1946 – Micheline Bernardini modeled the first modern bikini at a swimming pool in Paris.1948 – National Health Service Acts created the national public health system in the United Kingdom.1950 – The Knesset passed the Law of Return granting all Jews the right to immigrate to Israel.1954 – The BBC broadcast its first television news bulletin.1954 – Elvis Presley recorded his first single "That's All Right" at Sun Records in Memphis Tennessee.1971 – The Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years was formally certified by President Richard Nixon.1975 – Arthur Ashe became the first black man to win the Wimbledon singles title.1977 – Zulfikar Ali Bhutto the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan was overthrown.1989 – Oliver North was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term two years probation $150000 in fines and 1200 hours community service.
