L, VACCINATIONS AND IMMUNE MEMORY. THE DANGER OF ANTIVAXX PROPAGANDA AND VACCINE HESITANCY., wagthedot, 2021-05-03, Why it is IMPORTANT that most or all people over 16 year old (> 16 yo) get vaccinated within the next 6-9 months. And why this should happen not only in the US/EU/and other developed countries but all over the world ‚óè Please examine the attached graph (US population distribution by age 2020) to better understand the situation we are currently facing. Population distribution is probably similar to countries in the EU.‚óè Herd immunity is reached when 70-85% of population is either naturally infected with the virus and recovered or is vaccinated. The more infectious a virus the higher percentage of vaccinations needed until herd immunity is reached.‚óè In the US children under 15-16 yo make up about 20% of the entire population. Since current vaccines can be administered only to those > 16 yo to reach herd immunity practically (almost) all adults over 16 yo must be vaccinated (or naturally infected/recovered).‚óè There are ongoing clinical trials to develop Covid-19 vaccines for children. Vaccinating children < 16 yo (~20% of entire population) would allow reaching herd immunity even when not the entire adult population is immunized.‚óè In the US and EU about 30-50% population was immunized with either one or two vaccine jabs. Another 5-10% population was naturally infected with Covid-19 and recovered. The so-called ‚Äúimmune memory‚Äù in these people generally protects them from severe infections and largely prevents viral transmission within this group. The immune memory is expected to last ~ 1 year hopefully longer (not yet exactly known). Afterwards people in this group will likely need a booster vaccine shot or else they will again become susceptible to viral infection or re-infection. This drop in immune memory is more rapid in the oldest population who are also the most susceptible to severe disease and death‚óè A booster vaccine shot may also be necessary at some point in everyone because of new Covid‚Äî19 mutant variants that appear in populations where the infection is still rampant.‚óè About 40-60% current population in the EU or US has either NOT been naturally infected or has NOT been vaccine-immunized. This includes children < 16 yo (there is no vaccine yet for them) and adults who are either hesitant or antivaxx or simply do not yet have access to vaccine. The virus keeps spreading within this population segment keeps mutating and will eventually re-infect again the population currently protected when their immune memory fades in time restarting a vicious cycle.‚óè It is then obvious that vaccine hesitancy or antivaxx mentality will hurt economic recovery and the return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. If significant ¬†percentage of ADULT population (>16 yo) is NOT vaccinated in the next 6 months or so the virus will persist within this group. In 6-9 months the virus will AGAIN be capable to re-infect the adults currently protected by vaccines or by previous infection. Particularly the oldest population will be susceptible again.‚óè In addition to stop this pandemic PEOPLE IN ALL OTHER COUNTRIES will have to be immunized: the entire world will need to reach 70-85% immune memory protection or else with the ease of travel non-immunized infection-susceptible people will be able to re-infect those who were vaccinated in the past but in whom immune memory decreased in time..üî¥ BOTTOM LINE : the more antivaxxer/hesitant people are out there the longer the pandemic will last the more people will unnecessarily die and the economic recovery will be delayed. We are in this together the entire world.
