L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Jackie Walorski- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-22, In 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” presented its original profile of the U.S. House Representative from Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District Jackie Walorski who during her time in the Indiana House of Representatives from 2004-2012 gained some notoriety for being a co-sponsor of a widely contested Voter ID bill to curtail the statistically non-existent problem of in-person voter fraud that led to a slew of lawsuits was barely upheld in a U.S. Supreme Court challenge and was then duplicated by various other Republican-controlled state legislatures to ensure voter suppression as a national tactic. What really made Jackie Walorski stand out however was her complete dedication to attacks on a woman’ right to choose often sabotaging common sense legislation in the Indiana state legislature by adding on riders or amendments regarding abortion that would be the “poison pill” to make Democrats in Indiana forced to no longer support it.She used this tactic most famously (and disgustingly) to sabotage legislation to prevent hate crimes against the LGBTQ community by putting in an amendment to consider fetuses a protected group. Walorski decided to make the jump to national politics and hoped to ride the Tea Party Wave to Washington D.C. to represent Indiana’s 2nd District in the 2010 elections challenging Democratic Congressman Joe Donnelly for his U.S. House seat. During that campaign she spoke about privatizing Social Security and with her radical record in the Indiana state legislature voters still balked at the idea of putting her into office.But alas she still wasn’t giving up hope especially after Indiana’s 2nd District was gerrymandered after the 2010 elections by House Republicans so that Walorski could get another chance at weaseling her way into Congress again once it had a +6 Republican lean rather than the previous rating only a +2 lean that it had when she lost to Joe Donnelly in 2010. Donnelly didn’t want a rematch and instead ran a successful campaign in 2012 to be elected to the U.S. Senate.Jackie Walorski would lose any advantage she might have gained from fundraising though after she was involved in a scandal regarding her attempts to fundraise off of a Planned Parenthood “sting” video. No not the ones that popped up over the summer of 2015. Walorski was using footage from a pro-life activist pretending to be a 13 year old girl and go to a Planned Parenthood to raise money for her campaign coffers even prior to that slander. She sent the fundraising letter out during a period when it wasn’t allowed then tried saying the ethics committee who were investigating her for doing so were “overlooking the rape and sexual abuse of a 13-year old minor”. (Which again wasn’t true she wasn’t 13 wasn’t raped or abused and wasn’t pregnant.)Anyway Walorski’s Democratic opponent was an Iraq War Veteran Brendan Mullen and as the polling showed the race tightening in August of 2012 she made the classy decision to doxx him and release his home addresses in Washington D.C. to the public in a campaign ad. Sadly this tactic may have worked as Walorski won office by only about 3800 votes 49 to 48%.(And we remind you this was after the district was gerrymandered to help her as a Republican.)Since she arrived in the capitol Walorski’s voting record includes votes against disaster relief funding for victims of Hurricane Sandy voting to defund the Department of Homeland Security to protest President Obama’s executive orders on delayed deportations  voting for the 2013 Government Shutdown and all anti-choice legislation that comes to the floor. Oh and she did react to the more recent faux-controversy over Planned Parenthood because of the Center for Medical Progress bogus sting videos accusing the organization of “selling baby body parts.” Which if you recall is the exact kind of rhetoric that motivated Robert Dear the shooter who attacked and killed several people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood so thanks for that Jackie.      Ironically in 2016 Rep. Walorski survived both a primary challenge because of how she pulled her own anti-choice bill HR 7 because she realized too late that it would not provide exceptions for rape unless it was reported to authorities. Both Walorski and Rep. Renee Ellmers  panicked and called for their own legislation to be dropped before they risked reigniting the War on Women claims the GOP had been battling in a big way (considering they schedule the vote on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling yeah it would have been pretty bad). Walorski was immediately branded a traitor to the Pro-Life movement and did her best to earn back their good graces by getting her name down as a co-sponsor on HR 36 in May of 2015 but to no avail she’s made herself the target of primary challenges for blinking whatsoever in anti-choice fanaticism. Jackie Walorski was re-elected in 2020 with 61% of the vote. She is currently doing everything she apparently can to assure the Covid-19 pandemic continues calling the concept of vaccine passports that would be required to be carried for admission to venues as “Un-American” because there’s nothing more representative of the USA than having the medical capability to fight a disease but allowing plague carriers to still spread it.       One Year Ago April 22nd 2020: Jackie Walorski (IN)… 2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago April 22nd 2019: Jackie Walorski (IN)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago April 22nd 2018: Jackie Walorski (IN)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago April 22nd 2017: Jackie Walorski (IN)… 2017 UpdateFive Years Ago.
