L, Ted Cruz’s Reason For A Possible 2024 Run Is Mercilessly Mocked, Lee Moran, 2021-07-02, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Thursday he was “certainly looking” at running for president in 2024. But the Trump-supporting politician’s reasoning for another presidential campaign caused much mirth on Twitter. “I’ll tell you 2016 was the most fun I’ve ever had in my life” Cruz who washed out in GOP primaries that year said on Newsmax. Is @tedcruz considering a 2024 presidential run? The Senator tells Newsmax: "I'm certainly looking at it... 2016 was the most fun I've ever had in my life. We came incredibly close." @Tom_Basile pic.twitter.com/pkvMJCOpki During the 2016 campaign Donald Trump attacked the looks of Cruz’s wife Heidi Cruz baselessly claimed Cruz’s father was somehow involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and gave Cruz the disparaging nickname “Lyin’ Ted.’” Trump also suggested the Canadian-born senator “may not even have a legal right to run.” Cruz in turn called Trump a “sniveling coward.” After Trump’s victory Cruz cozied up to him and became one of his most loyal defenders. Fun times indeed. Critics couldn’t quite get over Cruz’s reasoning: Remember when Trump said your father consorted with JFK’s killer.Good times good times. I’m sure Heidi had a blast too. I truly believe he gets off from humiliation. THU JUL 1ST 2021Ted Cruz Says He’s Seriously Considering Running For President Again in 2024Where??  In Cancun?? Of course he is.
