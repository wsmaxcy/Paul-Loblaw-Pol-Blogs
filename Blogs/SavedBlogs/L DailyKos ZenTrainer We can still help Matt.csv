L, We can still help Matt, ZenTrainer, 2021-04-30, I will admit I can be a bit slow on the uptake. You may already know this if you read my diary White Privilege almost 6 years ago. I have known that those in power only wanted a certain kind of person to vote and when I went to renew my drivers license in about 2014 I found out photo ID’s were now required to vote. That meant the drivers license station was packed with people especially elderly folks. For some reason they had not had to have photo’s on their drivers licenses before. Now their choice was to sit and wait 3 to 4 hours for a clerk to help them or use one of the 3 computers set up for do it yourself. This very nice guy was helping folks use the computers. He did not work there he was just helping. Boy was I pissed that voting the most basic of rights was being made even harder. Again! Registering voters became my passion and I was lucky to hook up with 90for90 a  voter advocacy group. I knew that the folks in charge only wanted a certain type of person to vote. After talking to political candidates from all over the country for the past 5 years I recently had the epiphany that those in power only want a certain type of person to run for office also!!! (I told you I was slow!)  Our very own Matt Rogers has been going through a ton of shit because the powers that be don’t want him to run for office. Our Matt Rogers the guy who always reaches out to help everyone. He helped to get a Democratic candidate running in every race in Florida and Matt lives in VA! I got a campaign email from him today and I’m reprinting it in full with his permission.  This all began during a long road trip with my wife Jasmine to Texas last May after the heinous murder of George Floyd. As the miles piled into the hundreds and the scenery changed again and again as we headed southwest I racked my brain to think about what more I could do to take a stand for the policies that we need like ending cash bail ending qualified immunity and legalizing cannabis in an equitable way. I decided to go against the grain and run for the state legislature.						 						Almost one year later after 15000 doors were reached after over 800 individual contributors reached into their pockets to chip in after close to 20000 phone calls were made to which hundreds of people responded that they’ve never even been asked about the state legislature this year’s effort was decided not by the voters at the ballot box in June; it was decided by three people on a rainy day in March in direct contravention of common practice by the Department of Elections.						 						Since 2017 alone 51 candidates including 15 current incumbents were spared the electoral death penalty that was meted out to three Black candidates running campaigns that weren’t very popular among the Democratic Party establishment. I will spare you additional particulars because they have been thoroughly examined and written about much more eloquently than I am capable of by national reporter Joan Walsh.  “State law provides for a 10-day ‘grace period’ at the board’s discretion. While exercising that discretion last year chair Bob Brink called disqualifying candidates over paperwork errors a ‘draconian’ move. ‘Doing that would run counter to my personal belief that as much as possible we ought to permit access to the ballot and let the voters decide’ Brink told The Roanoke Times.”– April 8 2021  “It looked rather like an incumbent-protection racket but at least they were all being honest about it.” – April 20 2021  						I’m writing today not to rehash this discussion but to thank you for the continued encouragement and support. For all of the disappointment this effort continues to be invigorating and historic because – while running this race for the 47th District – I’ve also been recruiting candidates across the state to challenge Republicans along with the organization 90 For 90. We recruited 36 of them to be exact. As a result we now have Democratic candidates running in every single House of Delegates district: 100 out of 100.						 						This year I will be directing the funds I raise towards helping those candidates – many of whom are in “ruby red” districts that are perpetually ignored by the powers that be. Those are the people on the front lines of building the Democratic Party from the bottom up. Those are the people who can help us grow the Democratic majority in the House. Those are my people!						 						The inspiration for 90 For 90 and my oldest mentor Dr. Fergie Reid Sr. was not successful in his first pursuit of elected office in 1965 because of shenanigans. He ran again and won in 1967. As a result he became the first Black person elected to the Virginia General Assembly since Civil War Reconstruction. Unlike Dr. Reid Sr. candidates who became the highly-visible exceptions to the long-held practice of being provided extensions are in the position of having the opportunity to run next year and the year after that without much wait at all. This is because of the delay in Census data’s effect on redistricting (* cough * gerrymandering).						 						To be clear the victims here are the voters of the overwhelmingly Democratic 47th 52nd and 69th Districts – who will have effectively no say in electing their state representatives this year.						 						As for me I’ve frankly never been happier. Two days after deciding that I’d run for the House of Delegates last May I found out that I was going to be a dad. Mandela Rogers was born on January 21st and over the last four weeks I’ve had the chance to spend more time than I have had during the rest of his short life combined. I’m getting my second COVID vaccination tomorrow – which gives me a higher level of confidence about getting back into coaching flag football this Fall. My beautiful wife Jasmine is back to having to hear my corny jokes and my over-indulgence in sports television at insanely loud volumes. And I’ve just begun a new job with a very well known well respected and powerful local government official.						 						The future is bright and opportunities are plentiful for me. However the fights of our time remain. In those fights you will find me. That’s just who I am. I hope to see you there.						 						SincerelyMatt Rogers      We can always count on Matt Rogers. Let’s show him that he can count on us!
