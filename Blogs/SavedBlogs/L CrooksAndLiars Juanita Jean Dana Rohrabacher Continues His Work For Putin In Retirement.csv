L, Dana Rohrabacher Continues His Work For Putin In Retirement, Juanita Jean, 2021-06-16, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Sometimes you just gotta wonder how how deep the Putin love goes in the GOP.  And here’s why I conjure up that... #SeditionHunters - Thursday’s arrest of Alan Hostetter highlighted extremism in Orange County CA but even he is junior-league.  We knew OC would send their finest and here he is the highest-profile #SeditionVIP yet: former U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA 42).  1/ pic.twitter.com/yJDdR5aR4T — capitolhunters (@capitolhunters) June 12 2021 Could he be disloyal? @anneapplebaum: he's “the living breathing embodiment of the moral corruption that has seeped into a part of the Republican Party foreign policy establishment..[that] stopped caring about U.S. leadership of the democratic world" 4/https://t.co/PGepb1hLoy — capitolhunters (@capitolhunters) June 12 2021 Rohrabacher is tied to ther OC seditionists. Here he is with Alan Hostetter in Dec. 2020 calling for revolution against “Communists…Marxist-Leninists who are trying to destroy the integrity of our voting system”. No Dana voters just didn’t like you. 5/https://t.co/LcO3DeuNd2 — capitolhunters (@capitolhunters) June 12 2021 Republican congresstraitor Dana Rohrabacher continues his work in retirement. On Jan 6 Rohrabacher roamed the Capitol all day with a guy in a giant ushanka hat. Is this epic trolling by Russia? In 2016 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.”  Looks like they both are still on the payroll. Capitol Hunters is a fun place to track people on January 6th if it’s too damn hot to mow the back 40.
