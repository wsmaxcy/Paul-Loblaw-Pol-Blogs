L, Victory for Voting Rights in New Hampshire, MikePhoenix, 2021-07-04, Didn’t see this covered elsewhere. I’m going to leave it up. If anybody has a better diary on this feel free to use this diary to promote yours. I think it’s about time to put the meme that we are beaten on voting rights to rest. The New Hampshire Supreme Court struck down GOP voter suppression laws that make it harder for students to vote. The law known as Senate Bill 3 required residents who wanted to register to vote within 30 days of an election to fill out what the court described as "complicated" registration forms as well as provide proof-of-residence documents or else face fines as high as $5000 or even up to a year in prison.
