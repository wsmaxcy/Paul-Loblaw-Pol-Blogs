L, With his "patio rant" previous guy's Big Lie is the ultimate deep fake, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-05-03, Like any good con artist¬†Trump now tries to call his losing a ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù because he‚Äôs all about the disinformation as he does his lounge act in Florida and now New Jersey. Trump or his media image is the kind of synthetic construction that combines the GQP lie affirmed by current elected Republicans with the bogus election ‚Äúaudits‚Äù. In Washington normally chatty senators scramble to skirt the question and internal feuding over who is to blame for the Jan. 6 insurrection has riven the House Republican leadership with tensions between House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming the No. 3 House Republican spilling into public view. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is facing a Trump-aligned primary challenger in her 2022 race inspired by¬†her call for Trump to resign¬†after the Jan. 6 attack and her later vote to convict him over his role in inciting the insurrection. Local officials too are facing censure and threats ‚Äî in states from Iowa to Michigan to Missouri ‚Äî for publicly accepting the election results. And in Arizona‚Äôs largest county¬†a hand recount of 2.1 million votes cast in November is underway¬†by Republicans who dispute the results in yet another effort to overturn the results of the November contest. The issue also could reverberate through the 2022 midterms and the 2024 election with Trump already slamming Republicans who did not resist the election results. For Republicans fealty to the falsehood could pull the party further to the right during the primaries providing challenges during the general election when wooing more-moderate voters is crucial. And for Democrats the continued existence of the claim threatens to undermine Biden‚Äôs agenda. www.washingtonpost.com/...
