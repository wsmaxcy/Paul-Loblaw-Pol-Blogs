L, Shock and Awe, Paul Frea, 2021-04-29, Contemplating the last year we’ve been through seeing vaccinations sweep the nation and beginning to feel that soon this pandemic will be over… this poem came to me.  So many of us have been trapped In our homes This last year And have found ourselves with Extra time on our hands  Being a male I checked to see What other men were doing  In their homes Two trends stood out  Many men have gyrated To workouts Turning a bit of empty space Into a home gym  There they have struggled to master The one-handed push-up And other manly goals Of strengthening and exercise  And cries of  “Hold it hold it hold it.” And “One more rep one more rep one more rep.” Have echoed in their rooms Amazing!  Other men have taken up baking With construction goals of  Not 3-layer cakes or 7-layer But 11-layer cakes or beyond  Or they have turned to the quest Of the quintessential cookie Not too chewy not too crisp With just the right balance Of pecans to chocolate chips And a hint of lemon zest  A smaller group tasked themselves  To perfect the puffiest cream puff With the creamiest inner cream And the freshest whipped topping Yum!  Now I ask you dear readers Who have grown to know me Through my poems  Over the years  When I go to the beach on July 4th This summer And take off my shirt Will it be a moment of shock Or awe?                                         Carl Scott Harker ©2021 _________________________________________________________ My latest book of poetry —  poems written between late April to Late October 2020 is now available and you can find it on Amazon here:  Above Us Only Sky.
