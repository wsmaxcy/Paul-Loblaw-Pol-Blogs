C, China Expects Billion-Dollar-Bought-Off Biden Will Restore Pre-Trump US Capitulation, Seton Motley, 2021-01-05, Illegally President-elect Joe Biden is unquestionably the most preemptively compromised chief executive in US history. Bobulinski Tells Tucker Carlson that Joe Biden Lied about Son Hunter’s Business Dealings Hunter Biden ‘Made 411 Trips Across 29 Countries’ Often to Make Deals with ‘Foreign Oligarchs’ Hunter Biden’s Family Name Aided Deals with Foreign Tycoons ‘The Biden 5’: Deals in China Costa Rica Iraq Kazakhstan Russia Ukraine Ukraine Busts Bribe Scheme for Company that Hired Hunter Biden Vanity Fair: Hunter Biden’s $1.5 Billion Bank of China Deal Source: Joe Biden Is The ‘Big Guy’ Referenced in Hunter’s Massive China Business Deal Communist China is unquestionably our nation’s chief global enemy.  Don’t believe me?  Ask them. China’s Secret Plan to Topple the US as the World’s Superpower Why China’s Military Sees America as the True Enemy Inside China’s High-Stakes Campaign to Smear the United States over Coronavirus But Biden couldn’t care less about any of this.  Because he’s been bought and paid for.  He is the Chi-Comms’ “Big Guy.” Biden’s Comments Downplaying China Threat to U.S. Fire Up Pols on Both Sides Biden Downplays China Again after Bowing to Pressure Last Time Watch: Joe Biden Told Americans Not to ‘Panic’ About Coronavirus in February All of this was before Biden stole the election.  Now that he has – the following is unquestionably the safest bets in decades. China Hopes Joe Biden Will End Trump’s Cold War Follow Sensible Approach to Restore Ties: “As Joe Biden is set to assume power this month China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday hoped that the US President-elect would end the incumbent Donald Trump’s ‘Cold War’ policy towards Beijing and return to a ‘sensible approach’ by restoring normal ties.” What does Communist China mean by “restoring normal ties?”  The awfullest of DC Swamp awfulness. The Ruling Class Has Sold Out the American People on Communist China ‘Woke’ Capitalists Sell Out U.S. to China Behind a Mask of Virtue One Thing Way Worse than Too Much US Government? Too Much Chinese Government: “(Republican President Richard) Nixon’s biggest mistake – was opening the seething cauldron of snakes that is Communist China: “‘U.S. President Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to China (officially the People’s Republic of China or PRC) was an important strategic and diplomatic overture that marked the culmination of the Nixon administration’s resumption of harmonious relations between the United States and China. “‘The seven-day official visit to three Chinese cities was the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC; Nixon’s arrival in Beijing ended 25 years of no communication or diplomatic ties between the two countries and was the key step in normalizing relations between the U.S. and China.’ “China has been ripping US off ever since.  They were dead broke in 1972 – now they are challenging our global leadership all around the globe. “China got from there to here – by stealing tens of millions of our jobs…and trillions of dollars of our wealth and intellectual property.” China knows Intellectual Property (IP) is the preeminent component to their global domination. Intellectual Property: Constitutional and Crucial to Economic and National Security Before China can steal the manufacturing of our products – the products must first be invented. So China steals IP – and its creation.  And takes it all way more seriously than the DC Swamp “normally” does. China Stealing Trillions In Intellectual Property How China Squeezes Tech Secrets from U.S. Companies How Communist China Is Demonstrably Better Than US at IP Protection Communist China’s Latest Intellectual Property Con: Stealing IP Creation China Theft of Technology Is Biggest Law Enforcement Threat to US FBI Says But that was the Trump Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) saying that.  Biden’s looming FBI?  Most definitely not so much. The Troubling Reason Why Biden Is So Soft on China Biden Owes China Billions. He Shouldn’t Be Working for Government When Biden was Barack Obama’s Vice President – this happened…. Intellectual Property Crisis: U.S. Drops Out Of The Top Ten In Innovation Ranking Trump undid a lot of the damage. Another Obama-Undoing Great Idea: Plug the Obama-Era Holes In Our Patent Protections USPTO: One Deep State Swamp Backwater That Is Getting Drained: “We’re now back up to #3.  And rising with a bullet.” Trump did this in no small part by creating the global movement against China. Trump Announces Unprecedented Action Against China Trump Pressures World Trade Organization to Stop ‘Cheating’ By China The World Is Finally Uniting Against China’s Bully Tactics Do we really think Bought Biden will continue this excellent work? After Trump Biden Faces Pressure to Stand Up to China I remain HIGHLY dubious. You should too. Because $1.6 billion.  And then some.
