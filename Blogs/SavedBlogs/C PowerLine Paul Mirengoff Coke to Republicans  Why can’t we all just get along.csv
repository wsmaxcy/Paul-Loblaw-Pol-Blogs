C, Coke to Republicans:  Why can’t we all just get along?, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-04-15, When woke corporations started attacking Georgia over its new voting law Coca-Cola led the charge. Its chief executive James Quincey went on television to  declare the law “unacceptable.”  But now following outrage by Republicans over corporate America’s attempt to do the Democrats’ bidding on state election law issues Coke isn’t so sure that alienating a large portion of the electorate is a good idea. Thus as  Karen Townsend observes Coke’s name didn’t appear on a two-page ad in yesterday’s print editions of the New York Times and Washington Post that expressed opposition to voting law reforms under consideration in various states. Delta Airlines another leader in the charge against Georgia’s law also declined to join in the latest effort to virtue signal and help Democrats. General Motors Netflix Starbucks BlackRock Target Facebook Bank of America MasterCard and  inevitably United Airlines were among the virtue signalers. Here is what Coke now  says about the matter: 
We believe the best way to make progress now is for everyone to come together to listen respectfully share concerns and collaborate on a path forward. We remain open to productive conversations with advocacy groups and lawmakers who may have differing views. It’s time to find common ground. In the end we all want the same thing – free and fair elections the cornerstone of our democracy.
 Evidently Coke has branched out. It’s now in the apple sauce business. A few days ago I finished the last can of Coke we purchased before the company took sides on Georgia’s voting law. I miss the drink already though I might finally be able to lose those last five pounds.  Thus it would be nice to “find common ground” with Coke on voting. It would be even nicer if Coke simply eschewed political advocacy.  But whatever it’s now saying about voting Coke hasn’t given up on woke. As we reported  here the company is requiring that law firms representing it set aside 30 percent of billable hours on Coke matters for “diverse” attorneys with at least half of that time going to Black attorneys. This despite the fact that Blacks make up only about  5 percent of Americans licensed to practice law.  In other words Coke is coercing law firms into committing  race discrimination. It’s also probably forcing Black law firm associates to bill an ungodly numbers of hours and I suspect encouraging billing fraud.  Coca-Cola has brazenly announced that it is basing contracting decisions on race. It is thumbing its nose at the nation’s civil rights laws. There can be no common ground with Coke on this.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
