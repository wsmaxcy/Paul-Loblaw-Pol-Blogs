C, From the Bizarre Twin Cities Hellworld (5), John Hinderaker, 2021-04-18, A little while ago a man carjacked a vehicle on a major road in a suburb adjacent to mine. Police gave chase and he fired at them out of a window of the vehicle. With the police closing in he rolled out of the moving car and ran onto an adjoining highway trying to carjack a second vehicle. At some point he was shot by police officers: GRAPHIC VIDEO WARNING Person pursued by police jumps out of moving car appears to point a gun at another car on Highway 13 at I-35W in Burnsville. Runs into grass median and goes down. Working on details. Hwy 13 closed both directions. #BREAKING @kare11 pic.twitter.com/B0GUgUunAT — Chris Hrapsky (@ChrisHrapsky) April 18 2021  
The criminal was wounded but apparently alive at last word. The all-important question is what is the race of the criminal? If he is black like most carjackers it means another week of riots. If he is white no one cares. I can’t tell from the video but it looks like he might be white. Let’s hope so. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
