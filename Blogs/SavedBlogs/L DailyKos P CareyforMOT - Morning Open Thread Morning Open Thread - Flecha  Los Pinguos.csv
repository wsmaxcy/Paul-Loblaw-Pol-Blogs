L, Morning Open Thread - Flecha | Los Pinguos, P CareyforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-04-29,  Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve come to think of this post as one where you come for the music and stay for the conversation—so feel free to drop a note. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. Good morning everyone and welcome to Morning Open Thread.  Just as an FYI for our regular readers I will be out of town and on the road for the next 10 days. CaptBLI has very graciously agreed to fill in for my regular Friday posts this week and next. And I would appreciate everyone’s help in responding to comments and supporting him while he pulls double and triple duty over the next week or so. Sorry to post and run but I have a coffee date with a woman who lives over 1200 miles away and like me she hates to be kept waiting.  Cheers all and do have a wonderful day. Now some music from Playing for Change.  ❧ ❧ ☕️ Grab your coffee or tea and join us please. What's on your mind this morning?
