L, Two Sides of the Same Con, ReasonaBill, 2021-05-03, If you take a moment and listen to the so-called moderate wing of the Republican party they are as extreme as the rest. This weekend Utah Senator Mitt Romney was roundly booed by members of his party at the Utah GOP convention. The crime that elicited the verbal censure from the crowd following a failed earlier attempt at official public censure was that he concluded that the formal literal flag-hugger of his party lacked character and was wholly unfit for the job.  Before you think I have gone around the bend in praise of Mitt Romney the same Romney who has said in the past the former President has no moral character interviewed for a job with the former president after his election in 2016. Despite the public recriminations by ‘moderate’ GOP Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins they both voted with the President more often than not. Factually the median voting percentage for the GOP in the Trump era was 92 percent with the president.  Why dredge up the past you ask… Because the GOP has opened their party up to wild conspiracists white supremacists and now the denial of the results of a free and fair election our great Democracy has become a circus sideshow for the world to point at and snicker.  Using the incredulous excuse of a ‘Big Tent Party” and not rejecting a cancer that is killing their party will eventually kill us all. Republicans are insanely demanding that partisanship means that liberals people of color and Jews need to accept their oppressors' ideas as a cogent argument. Using arguments that are similar to the debates over slavery is not a basis for compromise they are a basis for commitment to an insane asylum. The scare tactics and gun to the head politics of the GOP have worked so long for them that conservatives are willing to accept anything or anyone who adds to the hordes.  Loudly espousing your right to an opinion does not make your opinion a fact.  Governors Kristi Noem and Ron DeSantis are the new GOP darlings. Gov. Noem who allowed more than 500000 attendees to visit her state for a motorcycle rally during the height of Covid-19 also had trouble understanding why the decades' long ban on fireworks is being kept in place because of the increased fire danger as a result of an insect invasion killing trees. Aside from the mountain pine beetle Noem also spent a thousand dollars to present Donald Trump with a replica of Mount Rushmore featuring his likeness. “I knew that that was something that he would find special” said Noem. During Ron DeSantis’ gubernatorial campaign his over-the-top devotion to Trump included having his baby daughter build a toy wall and reading her a Trump bedtime story. This sort of messianic zeal is dangerous to democracy. Yet currently these are the early GOP frontrunners for the 2024 presidential race.  Trump is morally responsible for the January 6 insurrection said Mitch McConnell “There is no question none that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day” he said and added that Mr. Trump watched the events unfold on television. “A mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name” he said. “These criminals were carrying his banners hanging his flags and screaming their loyalty to him.” McConnell even suggested the president could face criminal charges.    Less than two months later Mr. McConnell was asked by Fox News host Bret Baier if he would support Trump were he GOP nominee in 2024 McConnell responded “The nominee of the party? Absolutely.” Mr. Trump has become the disguise for a group of anti-American-wanna-be fascists and the party needs him as camouflage to point at and say not me.  Continue to Vote for Change.
