L, Texas Is Gaining 2 New Congressional Seats & Beto O'Rourke Is Already Working To Make Them Blue, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-30, Received this e-mail today from former presidential candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D. TX) on behalf of his organization Powered by People: Did you see the news this week? Texas gained the most residents in the past decade of any state according to the 2020 census – and as a result Texas is the only state that will be gaining TWO new congressional seats. This represents a huge opportunity for change in the 2022 elections. This could mean sending two new Democrats to the House of Representatives and the reapportionment of the State Legislature means we can take back power at every level. But we still don't know how the new districts will be drawn and with 2022 a midterm election – an election historically difficult for the president's party – we can't take anything for granted. If we're going to take advantage of this opportunity we need to step up now ahead of our end-of-month fundraising deadline tonight at midnight. Please chip in now to support our work to register more voters and elect more Democrats in 2022 and beyond.
