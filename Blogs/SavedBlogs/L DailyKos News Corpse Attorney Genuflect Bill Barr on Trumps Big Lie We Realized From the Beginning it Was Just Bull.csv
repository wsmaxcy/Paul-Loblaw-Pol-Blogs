L, Attorney Genuflect Bill Barr on Trump's Big Lie: We Realized From the Beginning it Was Just Bull****, News Corpse, 2021-06-27, The frantic and futile excuses being proffered by Donald Trump's accomplices in his decimation of democracy continue to accumulate amidst the rubble of his disastrous administration. Like rats abandoning the carcass of the USS Trump they are affecting a full retreat in the hopes of salvaging the remnants of their reputations. The latest rat to run ashore is Trump's Attorney Genuflect Bill Barr. A new and appropriately titled book scheduled for release later this year - Betrayal by ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl - reveals some choice quotes by Barr related to Trump's "Big Lie" that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. Barr told Karl that... And on allegations that voting machines were rigged to switch votes from Trump to Biden Barr said that... Really? Then how would Barr explain his staunchly sycophantic behavior while heading the Justice Department? How would he explain his initiatives to "uncover" alleged mail-in voter fraud for which he admitted there was no evidence? How would he explain his appointment of special counsel John Durham to investigate contrived election irregularities involving Russia? And how does Barr explain his request to Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch to "muzzle" one of the network's few Trump critics? At what point did Barr "realize" that all of these projects were bull manure? It certainly wasn't "from the beginning." While it's interesting to see Barr confess that there was never any truth to Trump's whining about non-existent voter fraud (which he is still doing) we must remember that Barr was fully complicit in Trump's long and dangerous campaign of lies. He is only conceding these sins to absolve himself of the guilt that he deserves and to try to piece together his shattered reputation. It isn't going to work. And Trump along with his criminal mob (including Barr) will forever be stained as traitors to America. NOTE: Twitter recently suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
