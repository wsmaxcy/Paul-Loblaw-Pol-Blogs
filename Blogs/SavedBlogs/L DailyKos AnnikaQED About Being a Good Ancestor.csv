L, About Being a Good Ancestor, AnnikaQED, 2021-07-06, I just read a thought-provoking article in VOX: "How to Be a Good Ancestor". It details a growing global movement to consider the rights of future generations (the “rights of the unborn” if you will) in making legal and political decisions.  Several Indigenous communities have long embraced the principle of “seventh-generation decision making” which involves weighing how choices made today will affect a person born seven generations from now. In fact it’s that kind of thinking that inspired Japanese economics professor Tatsuyoshi Saijo to create the Future Design movement (he learned about the concept while visiting the US and found it extraordinary).  ...failing to think long term is a huge problem. Threats like climate change pandemics and rapidly emerging technologies are making it clear that it’s not enough to adopt “sustainability” as a buzzword. If we really want human life to be sustainable we need to break out of our fixation on the present. Training ourselves to take the long view is arguably the best thing we can do for humanity. ... Hilary Greaves a philosopher at the University of Oxford [argues] “I’d hope that most reasonable people would agree that pain and suffering on the other side of the world matter just as much as pain and suffering here” she said. In other words spatial distance is morally irrelevant. “And if you think that then it’s pretty hard to see why the case of temporal distance would be any different”. Roman Krznaric a research fellow at the Long Now Foundation and the author of the new book The Good Ancestor offers an even starker analogy. “If it’s wrong to plant a bomb on a train that kills a bunch of children right now it’s also wrong to do it if it’s going to go off in 10 minutes or 10 hours or 10 years” .... “I think we shouldn’t be afraid of making that moral argument.” And increasingly people are making that moral argument. “Legal struggles for the rights of future people are exploding around the world” Krznaric said. Such an argument has been successfully made in many countries including the US Japan Canada the Netherlands Germany and Pakistan.  [I]n April Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled against the expansion of the cement industry which is terrible for the climate in certain areas of Punjab. In the decision the presiding justice wrote:     “The tragedy is that tomorrow’s generations aren’t here to challenge this pillaging of their inheritance. The great silent majority of future generations is rendered powerless and needs a voice. This Court should be mindful that its decisions also adjudicate upon the rights of the future generations of this country.” ...The push to embrace this kind of thinking isn’t limited to the courts. A few countries have already created government agencies dedicated to thinking about policy in the very long term. Sweden has a “Ministry of the Future” and Wales and the United Arab Emirates both have something similar. ... On both sides of the Atlantic intellectuals in recent years have formed organizations dedicated to cultivating long-term thinking. While the UK has groups like the Centre for Long-Term Resilience Ari Wallach has been working on Longpath in the US. Operating under the motto “Be Great Ancestors” Longpath gathers together CEOs academics and other individuals to do exercises meant to counter short-term thinking from practicing mindfulness to writing letters to their future selves. The article dives into philosophical arguments for “strong long-termism” and discusses future threats — not just climate change and future pandemics but also bioweapons and AI.   It ends with this reading list. The whole article is well-worth a reading; “strong long-termism” is a movement in which DK might wish to play a part. P.S.  I think my application of the phrase “rights of the unborn” to “long-termism” could be effective though perhaps antagonizing.  And I’ll put in a pitch for a new Sci-Fi film — “The Tomorrow War” — which although cliched in places presents a scenario that fits in well with these issues. It could be a good jumping-off point for discussions with your kids.
