L, The Daily Bucket: Swallows Scissortails and Dickcissels...and you want MORE?, AppyforBackyard Science, 2021-05-04,  The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge.			We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below. . Spring 2021 Kansas I make no secret of the fact that I revere Swallows. I admire them for all their wonderful skills and traits. Barn Swallows are the only ones who nest here but their beauty is astonishing. The excitement increased when they showed up in the barn to observe me during chores. They have been checking out nests and deciding which one to use for the first brood. They are entirely unconcerned by being in close proximity to my horses. In fact they seek out the horses feeding in the pasture flying circles around them in order to pick off any tasty morsels rousted from the grass by horse hooves. They use the same tactic when I am mowing pasture on the tractor. Watching Swallows take their prey right out of the air sure takes the humdrums out of mowing! Last year was a great year for raising young. My main pair raised 3 broods. Counting all busy nests in the main barn we produced at least 8 broods last year and most of the babies survived. They’re getting a late start this year so I don’t expect they will be able to raise more then two broods if that. You know it’s going to be a good morning when one of the first things you see is a happy bird on the line looking over the barn. This has painted kind of a warm and fuzzy picture of Swallow life hasn’t it? Well not everything is quite so easy going. Pre-nest selection there is that little matter of mate selection! Sometimes that turns into a very confrontational affair. After morning chores I take off up the Wagon Trail to do take care of business at dad’s place. There are Swallows all along that road. I got a few attempts at photos of confrontations while making that trip.  Swallows aren’t the only thing I see while on the Wagon Trail. Over the past two weeks I’ve come up with photos of three potential possible first time ever sightings and most certainly photos of some pretty special birds.  Today (5/3/21) I got another chance to record some stellar photos of Scissor Tails. I snapped off 24 pics and thought I had it nailed. I had three of them in my sights! But they wouldn’t hold still and always seemed to find something to get in my way or simply took flight. They can be very erratic flyers.    Another first for me was some second rate photos of what I’m told is a Dickcisse. It looks similar to a Meadowlark but certainly has it’s differences.  I also took some photos of a hawk I thought to be leucitic. First is the original image.  I have posted that upgrading photos for each species in my collection is a priority for this year as well as collecting new species. I’m off to a great start! Next is an upgrade to my Blue Grosbeak content.    When stating my goals for this year I also said getting some good photos of a Kingfisher is high on my list along with Swallow BIF shots. What you’ve seen so far isn’t what I was shooting for but the following photo is much more along the lines of what I had in mind. Did I say it would knock your sock off! Maybe and in the event it doesn’t...I think you must have shown up to this diary barefooted! Check it out. Trash talk going both directions. Okay put your moccasins back on and add the great stuff you’ve been seeing.
