L, Tim Scott falsely denies that "America is Racist", Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-04-29, Tim Scott is a tool. He’s a token of the Republican Party to try and sell the idea that their party and wide swath’s of the GOP are not openly blatantly racist.  He admits to “experiencing” racism to being followed around in a store to being called names and insulted.  He argues that these are “isolated incidents.”  Really? Are they “isolated incidents” when they happen hundreds of thousands of times to hundreds of thousands of people? Hey I’ve been followed around in a store too.  Actually here’s the kicker — I was followed around in Nordstroms when I was there with my roommate — who was a white police officer — and our friend Kran Clay who is a cousin to Muhammad Ali.  I mean we were into wearing leather bomber jackets at the time but other than the jacket — what’s the reason for targeting our group as “Trouble.” I mean my roommate was armed also — so if things went south they would have gone really south. I’ve been through dozens of bullshit racist incidents in my life. Just about every black person has and frankly those are probably only half the actual incidents.  You never know if the reasons your rental/loan application was rejected was because of race because nobody will openly admit that to you.  You never know half the time why people do what they do not for certain. Almost nobody admits why they did what they did and that’s why nearlly everyone is always suspect. Are the various voting measures being pursued around the nation by the GOP racist?   Tim Scott argues they are not and that they have expanded voting hours and mail-in balloting.   Yeah except they removed 300 hours of access to mail-in ballot boxes.  They’ve blocked access to vote from a different precinct. They stiffened ID requirements which some Americans can’t comply with or which make things more difficult to vote as a student. They’ve restricted the time allowed to return and absentee ballot. They shortened the run-off period. They’ve made it optional for counties to expand their hours which allows them to make the hours 9am-5pm rather than 7am to 7pm cutting off two hours for those people who work during the day. Here’s Stacy Abrams documenting her specific oppositions to the Georgia Voting restriction Bill:  Although there may be some provisions in the bill which expand some access to voting for example the bill adds additional days for early voting since it also restricts it in other areas the question has to be — on balance — does it expand it more than it contracts?  I think it’s clear that the answer is the latter more than the former.  It’s not either/or — it does both. During his discussion with Abrams Sen. John Kennedy asks if President Biden should regret saying that people who support the Georgia bill are “racists?”  Now technically he didn't say that — he said the bill was Jim Crow 2.0 which is different thing but in response and to the further question “How do you know [this bill is grounded in racial animus?]” Stacy Abrams says this: Abrams: Because for 15 years the Republican Party of Georgia not only sanctioned but celebrated it’s vote by mail provisions. After voters of color used those provisions in favor of the party that they disproportionately support that those rules changed.  It’s that for years for nearly 2 decades we had early voting hours that supported voters that were perfectly fine it was only after communities of color used those provisions… [at which point Kennedy cut her off] I’m responding to the question you asked me. My point is that when your motivation is grounded in the race of those engaging in behaviors that you disagree with that is racist.  Particularly when it is target at communities of color by people in power. Kennedy: I agree with that.  I just want to know how do you know what they meant? Abrams: Because we asked them not to do it when we show them what the affect is and they refused to answer. And they refuse to revise.  I’ve worked with these people for 11 years I refuse to believe that every single person who supported this bill has racial animus in their heart for all persons but for the purpose of voting rights which racial animus as your predicate then “yes” you should be held accountable and those bill should be stopped. We used to have something to stop that — it was called the Voting Rights Act — which was gutted by Republicans.  Ain’t that a lucky coincidence? And so here we have the crux of the problem as the argument is repeatedly made how do you know what is in the heart of these people? How do you know their motivation?  Can you prove that they did what they did for reasons of racial animus? Frankly if that is the standard — you can never prove it.  You can never conclusively prove that anyone anywhere has racial bias as their motivation unless they openly admit and confirm it themselves. it’s possible that those who support this bill may have a partisan bias rather than racial and simply want to tip the scales back to their party regardless of race.  It’s just so happens that they’ve created provisions which make it more difficult to vote if you happen to be an essential worker in a crowded city — which will mostly affect black voters. its just a coincidence then right? Yeah sometimes its simply a lot more than coincidence when these factors keep piling up in state after state and time after time after time.  Tim Scott argued that he had a police reform bill that Democrats blocked.  He doesn’t point out that Democrats had their own reform bill and that his bill was effectively acting as a spoiler for that bill.  He doesn’t point out that his bill was highly watered-down and didn’t really include any provisions for adjusting qualified immunity which personally protects officers from being held accountable for their actions. But there are many occasions when police overstep their bounds.  For example why is it that that so many black people end up dead after encounters with police why is it so many white people — particular those who are suspects of mass murder — are arrested without incident?  Why is it that when the suspect is white — like Kyle Rittenhouse — the police are so willing to make excuses for them?  Why as they so willing to grant them the benefit of the doubt?  Why are they so willing to say — “They had a bad day?” Let’s get down to brass tacks shall we?  This man killed six Asian women and this fucking cop gets up to talk about this monster and says “He was having a bad day and he snapped.”  He was having a bad day.  He was having a bad day. Oops. And six Asian women were just collateral damage because this stupid animal had a bad day? What is this fucking fascination with protecting the futures of psychopathic white men? What is it? Why is that grace extended to every school shooter to every club shooter to every serial shooter — of which they are pretty much all white by the way? Why is that grace always extended to these monsters? But I can’t go jogging in my neighborhood without being terrified?  I was terrified I am terrified to send my Filipino husband out for groceries. I tell him to cover his eyes with sunglasses so they can not tell that he’s Asian.   “He was having a bad day” How dare you. You trivialize the lives of people of color all the time for doing the most trivial things. We are killed and you say that we “should have known better” we “should have complied” we just “shouldn’t have been breaking the law.”  Even if the law is just selling counterfeit bills. But these mutha fuckas can just murder us and they are taken in with fuzzy mittens and then given the benefit of the doubt. The benefit of the doubt when their hands are still wet from the blood that they spilt.  What is this fascination with protecting the reputation of white men no matter how psychopathic they may be? Y’know what I do when I have a bad day? I might drink whole bottle of wine I’ll watch anime all day I might scream I might even break a plate. Fuck it. Whatever. Y’know what I  don’t do —  I don't go on a fucking racist murdering spree. This man literally killed six Asian women and it looks like they are actually going with his story that wasn’t racially motivated. Just because he said so. “No it wasn’t aimed at Asian women it was aimed at sex my sexual whatever my sexual addiction.” That is the height that is the height of white privilege. To have an addition and blame it on somebody else. That’s -— I can’t. I I can’t.   We are never given the benefit of the doubt for anything.  Then to watch these monsters be protected and painted as troubled children.  Even though they’re probably 20 — 30 years old. “Troubled children who just lost their way.” Infantilizing these white men. “Oh poor boo hoo.  He’s probably got some psychological issues to work out.  Let’s throw him in therapy.”   But for us it’s like “No you’re a fucking animal and you shoulda known better.” The proof of racial animus is what happens when race is erased.  If the voters who put Democrats over the top in Georgia Arizona and Michigan were White would they be trying to block them from being able to vote next time?  Would they grant them the “grace” of their right to vote? Of course they would. is this a racist nation? Of course it is. The proof is in exactly what Nicole points out. Why didn’t George Floyd wanted on a misdemeanor get granted the grace of being taken to Burger King to smooth over his nerves when he had a panic attack?  That’s how they treated mass murderer Dylann Roof isn’t it?  He killed nine fucking people and they took him for snacks. Kyle Rittenhouse fucking killed two people and then fled the state yet he was arrested without incident. Amazing how they so easily arrest these mass murdering bastards but a guy with a broken tail light expired registration or subject to a search warrant gets a hail of bullets.  Why does it take over a half-dozen officers in full riot-gear to serve a warrant for 3 fucking grams of cocaine? Why aren’t all suspects particularly those with minor infractions or stopped for traffic violations treated with this level of dainty respect? Here’s one possible reason why White suspects peaceably surrender so easily and some POC suspects fight like hell.  White suspects know they’re going to be treated with respect they know their rights will be honored no matter how heinous their crimes — Black suspects may want that kind of treatment but they know damn well they aren’t gong to get it and they might not survive the encounter no matter how minor it may be.  Sadly many times the worried and terrified black and brown suspect is exactly right.  It’s not every time it’s not every incident but it’s frankly too damn many times — too damn many incidents.  And when these situations occur what does the rest of the “non-racist” white public do?  Ignore it. Rationalize it. Justify it. Excuse it. You don't have to question of what’s in someone’s heart you don’t need to know their motivations you can watch their actions in incident after incident. That reveals what and who they are. You don’t have to be a racist to actively implement racism.  Sometimes all you have to do is go along with the prevailing flow.  Let the standing presumptions the standing expectations the standing biases exist and thrive without questioning them without challenging them — without changing them.  It’s not about active racism. It’s about passive racism. Racist inaction. The active racists have always been a minority they’ve always been the exception — the norm are the persons who let the racist get away with it.  The norm are the persons who grants them a tacit endorsement with their lack of action. The norm are the allegedly good apples who stand by and let the bad apples run rampant. As a result racism is our resting state and it will remain so until we make that no longer the case. Scott says that our children are being “taught they are an oppressor.”  I don’t know about that but it’s clearly the wrong message.  Some of their ancestors have been oppressors now they have the social majority to potentially do the same but they don’t have to.  They can also stand by the sidelines and do nothing or they can get involved and end the oppression where they recognize it.  They have options they have choices.  Very rarely is that true of black and brown people.  Very rarely can the afford the luxury of ignoring the oppression and suppression they face.  Very rarely have they been able to implement any oppression of their own and why would they want to? Why would they wish to repeat the mistakes of the past? Just a little flashback of what happened when police pulled over who they thought was an average black woman and it turned out to be a local prosecutor.
