L, Supreme Court again proves that it needs to be fixed, Bernie Horn, 2021-04-26, The Supreme Court just announced that it will take a case designed to dangerously expand Second Amendment “rights.” The case is called New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Corlett and it would – and probably will – create a brand new constitutional right to carry concealed loaded handguns in public. Right now it’s a matter decided by state or local governments. In most red states anyone without a felony conviction can easily get a permit to carry concealed weapons and in some states people don’t need any kind of license to pack heat. In most blue states including New York individuals have to show some level of legitimate need in order to obtain a concealed weapons permit. The last Supreme Court ruling about guns was D.C. v. Heller 554 U.S. 570 (2008) when Justice Scalia writing for a 5-to-4 majority invented a constitutional right to possess loaded handguns in one’s residence “in defense of hearth and home.” On its face that ruling does not in any way apply to carrying concealed weapons in the streets. And as I’m sure you know the Second Amendment reads: “A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.” It is self-evident that carrying concealed weapons on the streets has absolutely nothing to do with a “well regulated Militia.” In short there is no legal precedent for the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld New York law. But the only reason for SCOTUS to accept this case is to reverse the Court of Appeals and create new Second Amendment “rights” out of whole cloth. Just so you can understand how the Court can invent Second Amendment law let me take you down Justice Scalia’s rabbit hole in the case of D.C. v. Heller. One of Scalia’s problems was that he couldn’t overturn the only other SCOTUS ruling on the Second Amendment U.S. v. Miller 307 U.S. 174 (1939). Miller had upheld the National Firearms Act in 1934 which strictly limits the civilian ownership of machineguns silencers bombs and sawed-off weapons. The defendant in this particular case had been charged with possession of a short-barreled shotgun. So Scalia had to find a way to rule that governments can limit a short-barreled shotgun but not a handgun. Now the rabbit hole. In Heller Scalia said the Second Amendment envisioned the Revolutionary War-era method of calling together a militia where able-bodied “men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.” He then asserted that handguns are in “common use” in 2008 so they are protected for the defense of one’s own home. Then he agreed with the Miller court’s decision that short-barreled shotguns were not “commonly used” for legal purposes in 1934 so they’re not protected by the Second Amendment. But realize the short-barreled shotgun was not “commonly used” precisely because they were banned by the National Firearms Act five years earlier. It was a circular argument. Scalia was brilliant so this was no mistake. The absurdity was intentional. We must expect something similar when SCOTUS likely strikes down the longstanding New York statute. What more do we need to know? The current Supreme Court is going to endanger the safety of all of us just to deliver a conservative political payback to the National Rifle Association. Can Biden’s Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court please hurry up and start the process toward reform? (Just incidentally whatever SCOTUS rules about concealed weapons it will not mean the Court will allow guns on its own property. Scalia already wrote a passage that guarantees the Second Amendment does not apply when courts and other government entities prohibit firearms from their buildings. Yeah he was also a hypocrite.)
