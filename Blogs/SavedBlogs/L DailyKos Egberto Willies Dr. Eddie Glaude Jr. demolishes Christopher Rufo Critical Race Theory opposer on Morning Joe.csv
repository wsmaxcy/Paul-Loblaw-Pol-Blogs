L, Dr. Eddie Glaude Jr. demolishes Christopher Rufo Critical Race Theory opposer on Morning Joe, Egberto Willies, 2021-07-07, Dr. Eddie Glaude Jr. destroys Christopher Rufo Critical Race Theory alarmist on Morning Joe and it was a sight to see. The difference between a demagogue spewing lies and talking points over intellect was palpable. See full episodes here. This was a necessary substantive discussion not specifically on Critical Race Theory (CRT) but on how it is being used to create dissension. Joe Scarborough gave the floor to Christopher Rufo first. He was in his usual hyperbolic scare-white-people mode. "This is one of the biggest kinds of misconceptions" said Christopher Rufo. "You can teach about slavery discrimination and racism without using critical race theory. Critical race theory in simple terms as an academic discipline that holds that the United States was founded on racism white supremacy and patriarchy and that those forces are still at the root of our society today. Critically Critical Race Theory reformulates the old Marxist dichotomy of oppressor and oppressed. But it replaces the class categories of bourgeoisie and proletariat with the racial categories of white and black. And if you look at the academic literature the Critical Race Theorists aren't merely saying we should examine the history of racial inequality or racial injustice. They're saying things that are much deeper. They call in to question the 14th amendment equal protection under the law. They call into question the first amendment right to free speech. They oppose capitalism and believe that a system of collectivism must be implemented in order to improve society. It's not a benign philosophy about teaching racism. It's a radical philosophy that's rooted in Marxism and is frankly inappropriate as a pedagogical framework for teaching children." He actually used the word benign and the teaching of racism in the same sentence. And he wants to rewrite America's foundational history. Later he would say that CRT attempts to make white children ashamed of who they are a far cry from the truth. Dr. Eddie Glaude placed CRT into context and then made a prescient statement. "This attempt to think about the US in a very very complex and nuanced way" Dr. Eddi Glaude said. "And I think it's really important that your opening question actually reveals something for Christopher. And if I could call you by your first name you know you've already stated very explicitly that this is not about the substance of Critical Race Theory. This is about branding. You tweeted it. Right? So this is an empty signifier to capture all of these things that so-called "are unpopular for Americans." And so part of what I want to suggest. Joe. It's not about whether or not we actually get critical race theory right. That's not actually the point that Christopher and his allies are actually engaged in. What we need to be asking is why are they doing this at this point? Why are they making these arguments at this moment?" The clip in this post goes into much more detail and worth a complete watch.
