L, The Supreme Court: To Expand or Not To Expand is not my question, Bad Reputation Good Trouble, 2021-05-04, The Supreme Court: To Expand or Not To Expand is not my question Regardless of expansion the Supreme Court Justices as well as other justices must have term limits. I can think of no other taxpayer support position that is a lifetime job guarantee. Justices refuse to retire even when burnout or health issues become impediments staying in their appointments until these men & women are well into their eighties or nineties and they pass away leaving a vacancy that lasts for months. Most people plan their retirements and announce their intentions so as to keep things functioning smoothly. Let's take this lesson away from Ruth Bader Ginsberg's passing and take away the Senate's ability to politically manipulate the judiciary especially since this is one of the few place the filibuster does not apply. The lack of limits leads to the problem of appointing young people to the bench. Â They not only should earn it through decades of experience not merely a few years but they should not expect to keep their jobs for 50+ years regardless of performance. Gorsuch Kavanaugh and Barrett are scant in real world judiciary experience and the Supreme Court Bench is not the place for beginners. These youngsters were pushed through based on their youth inexperience and extreme right wing authoritarian views and will likely keep their seats until 2070 if not longer. Term limits would allow us to bring the court back into balance and have retired judges who could teach write and share what they have learn tempered with time distance and perspective. Our courts like our society must be shaped by many points of view from a variety of peoples not by 9 or even 13 people who are rarely varied in makeup or opinion and left to shape our world for half of a century or more. We must impose limits on those we must trust to impose limits on us. There's no good reason not to limit terms for the Supreme Court Justices. 18 year term limit Thomas (R) nowBreyer (D) nowRoberts (R) 2023Alito (R) 2024 6 (R) + 3 (D) becomes 6 (D) + 3 (R) Sotomayor (D) 2027Kagan (D) 2028Gorsuch (R) 2035Kavanaugh (R) 2036Barrett (R) 2038
