L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Brian Babin- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-06-28, In 2016 2017 2018 2019 as well as 2020  “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” presented profiles of the sitting  U.S. House Representative from Texas’ 36th Congressional District Brian Babin  a dentist by trade who made his first run for Congress two decades ago  failing to be elected in 1996 and making news for being caught in a campaign finance scandal  where he was found to have tried circumventing the rules for maximum  donations from one donor by having intermediaries deliver the large sums  in smaller pieces. He was caught and fined $20000 by the normally  toothless FEC. Two years later in 1998 that scandal may not have been  what stood in the way of a Babin victory as much as the story of his  campaign manager simultaneously coming out of the closet and resigning  saying that Babin had said numerous disparaging things about homosexuals in private meetings.  Babin denied this but the tabloid-like nature of the story combined  with his earlier scandal was enough to sink his chances again.Well Texas' 36th District has never been shy about taking on controversial candidates considering they elected Rep. Steve Stockman  back in 2012 nearly two decades after he crazied his way out of  office. By 2014 Rep. Stockman had shown he hadn't changed much so the  district elected Babin another embarrassing throwback to two decades  earlier. During the 2014 election season Brian Babin revealed a variety  of mind-numbingly stupid ideas like his belief that the Affordable  Care Act would bankrupt America his desire to do away with the Department of Education the Department of Energy and the Department of Homeland Security and of course his desire to build a border wall along the U.S./Mexico  border (beating Donald Trump to the punch on this stupid stupid idea).Since hitting Washington D.C. in his late sixties he has followed up  on his campaign platform showing outrage whenever possible. Perhaps the  best example is his response to the Supreme Court's King vs. Burwell  ruling where he introduced legislation that would force all nine of the  Supreme Court Justices to enroll in healthcare through the Affordable  Care Act (rather than the insurance plans they already have) to show  them what they were relegating the American people to. Seriously this  was his patronizing quote:  A few months later his xenophobia hit a fever pitch. While most  Republicans freaked out about the Syrian refugee program AFTER the  terror attacks in Paris by ISIS sympathizers from France and Belgium  (i.e. not carried out by any Syrian refugees) On September 17th 2015  Brian Babin went on Facebook to call for a complete suspension of the  entire Refugee Resettlement Program writing:                 ”We  are crazy to be inviting the problems of the Middle East into the  United States. It's time to suspend the refugee resettlement program  until we are able to obtain factual information assess the federal  state and local costs and determine the national security risks. It’s  been on auto-pilot for far too long.”          Two months later in November of 2015 Babin took to Breitbart Radio to  be interviewed by Steve Bannon himself and talk about legislation he  filed to defund the Refugee resettlement program. While Babin  acknowledged that Mary Joseph and the baby Jesus were refugee this  was different because “Jesus and Mary didn’t have suicide bomb vests strapped on them.” Babin also has tried squaring his overall Islamophobic stance because he believes that "No-Go Zones" set up by Muslim communities are actually a thing happening in Michigan and Tennessee  and we should stop bringing in Muslims before more of them pop up. Hint  for sane people: These “no-go zones” are not happening. All the way up  into the last weeks of the Obama administration Babin was fear-mongering about the refugee resettlement program claiming it was a “Trojan Horse” to allow terrorists into the country. Once Donald Trump took office and instituted his unconstitutional Muslim ban it was Rep. Babin who sent out an e-mail to his constituents with  a survey asking if they supported the measure or not and within it claimed several Muslim countries as “terrorism hot spots” that have not produced a terrorist attacker in Europe or the United States within this century.Now as you might expect with his hate of Muslim refugees and a desire  to build a border wall Brian Babin ended up firmly in the corner of  Donald Trump in the fall of 2016. So much so in fact that he defended  Trump for calling Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” during one of the presidential debates as she handed Trump his ass. Babin’s logic? “I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she's being nasty. I do.”Brian Babin took the news of the GOP’s defeat in the 2018 elections  about as well as most Republicans which is not well. He’s still been  hosted by the “alt right” (i.e. white nationalist) Breitbart News for  interviews to claim that Democrats want “open borders” (a  political red herring) and otherwise fearmonger about immigrants in November of 2018 and only weeks into the new session of the House with  Democrats in control tried to block Palestinian-American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib from leading a delegation to the West Bank because of reasons that amount to trying to stir up Islamophobia.In 2020 he was pandering to xenophobes by taking  a visit down to the U.S/Mexico border in Arizona for photo-ops with  border patrol agents while claiming that the border wall was near  completion and one of Trump’s “promises made promises kept”. (Someone’s living in a fantasy world.)         Texas’ 36th is one of the reddest of red districts in all the country  with a +26 Republican lean in the Cook Partisan Voting Index which  helped Babin to coast to a third term in office with 74% of the vote. Back in Washington Brian Babin’s stupidity continues:  We will finish our update by linking to Brian Babin’s statement about  the January 6th attack on the Capitol where he lamented those who died  but defended his decision to not certify the election results citing the non-existent “Election Fraud that undermines our freedoms”. Hey he didn’t die he has no regrets. Nor any desire to hold anyone accountable.         One Year Ago June 28th 2020:  Brian Babin (TX)…   2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago June 28th 2019:  Brian Babin (TX)…   2019 UpdateThree Years Ago June 28th 2018:  Brian Babin (TX)…   2018 Update  Four Years Ago June 28th 2017:  Brian Babin (TX)…   2017 Update  Five Years Ago  June 28th 2016: Brian Babin (TX)… Original ProfileSix Years Ago  June 28th 2015: David Schultheis (CO)
