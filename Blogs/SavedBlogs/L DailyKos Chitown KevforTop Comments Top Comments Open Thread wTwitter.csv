NBC: Major Biden is getting trained for a cat to arrive at the  White House  https://t.co/cRQe5nX3Qf It’s about time! Comments below the fold. Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down. Please remember that comment inclusion in Top Comments does not constitute support or endorsement by diarist formatter Top Comments writers or DailyKos. Questions complaints or comments? Contact brillig. From inkstainedwretch: A comment by buddha2 points out that Former Guy tries to claim credit for others' work while downplaying his oh so many massive and/or deadly mistakes.  From Egberto Willies recommended post about Ron Klain casting aspersions at Sen.
