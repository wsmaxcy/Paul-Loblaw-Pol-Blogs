Biden’s America Last Power-Grabbing Executive Action Blitzkrieg Will Only Get Worse And here’s where it gets unintentionally morosely hilarious: Big Media is STILL pretending Hyper-Unilateral Biden is looking to lord over us – with anyone besides himself. Biden’s Bipartisan Goals Biden’s Bipartisan Push Biden’s Push for Bipartisanship Tests of Biden’s Leadership and GOP’s Willingness to Cooperate Come Quickly The “GOP’s willingness to cooperate?”  With whom?  Biden’s doing everything all by his himself. Why Biden’s Bipartisanship Hope Is Probably Already Lost The “bipartisanship hope is probably already lost” because…. Biden Sets Record for Executive Orders in First Six Days in Office Biden’s rapid-fire all-encompassing assault on the private sector is making it dramatically more difficult to do any sort of business anywhere in America. Biden Signals ‘New Direction’ on Regulations What was Biden predecessor Donald Trump’s old direction?
