L, Mining Heritage Exhibition: Headframes (photo diary), OjibwaforShutterbugs, 2021-07-03, The Mining Heritage Exhibition in Wallace Idaho is a four-acre historic park which operates exclusively through local efforts. The park displays mining artifacts and machinery from the area’s mining industry. Unfortunately the precious metals such as gold and silver sought by miners is often found deep underground. A headframe is the structural frame above an underground mine shaft which enables the hoisting of machinery personnel materials and of course the ore itself. The Mining Heritage Exhibition has examples of headframes and associated machinery. Some of the earliest and most primitive headframes used scaffolding made from wood. The power to run the hoist was then provided by a mule or a horse.   The mule (or horse) would be attached to this pole and would walk a circular path to raise the bucket. To lower the bucket the mule would be repositioned to walk in the opposite direction. The headframe for the Evolution Shaft is more substantial and used power from either electric or steam motors to run the hoist.    Shown above is the “bucket” that lowers into the shaft. Shown above is a bucket of ore being lifted out of the shaft. Operating a hoist safely and efficiently requires communication between the miners underground and the hoist operator on the headframe. According to the display: “Electrically operated bell and other signal codes have become a necessary part of safe shaft communication for many years. A typical mine utilizes two separate systems: a call system and a directive system. A worker on a given level will use a squawker (a very loud buzzer) to alert the hoistman that he/she needs a conveyance to travel to another level. The hoistman signals a response with his own squawker that he received and understand the request.” When the conveyance arrives the worker will use the bell cord at the shaft to signal the destination. The early electric hoists were a great improvement over the mule hoists and steam hoists. According to the display: “They were relatively trouble free and more efficient than those with other power sources.”    According to the display: “This assembly would most likely be used when an exploration prospect was underway in a location that did not have electric service.” When a rich ore body was encountered electrical lines would be put in to allow for electric hoisting.
