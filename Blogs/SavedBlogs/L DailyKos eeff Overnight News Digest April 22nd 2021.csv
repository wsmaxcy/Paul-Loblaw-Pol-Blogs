L, Overnight News Digest April 22nd 2021, eeff, 2021-04-22, Here are a few of tonight’s stories Expedition hauls tons of plastic out of remote Hawaii atolls US jobless claims fall to 547000 another pandemic low Russia to pull back troops from Ukraine border US House votes to make Washington DC the 51st state Mendota Student Wants To Reduce Plastic Bag Use In Minnesota Please add your stories this is an open thread AP News World leaders pledge climate cooperation despite other rifts The leaders of Russia and China put aside their raw-worded disputes with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday long enough to pledge international cooperation on cutting climate-wrecking coal and petroleum emissions in a livestreamed summit showcasing America’s return to the fight against global warming. Neither Vladimir Putin nor Xi Jinping immediately followed the United States and some of its developed allies in making specific new pledges to reduce damaging fossil fuel pollution during the first day of the two-day U.S.-hosted summit. But climate advocates hoped the high-profile — if glitch-ridden — virtual gathering would kickstart new action by major polluters paving the way for a November U.N. meeting in Glasgow critical to drastically slowing climate change over the coming decade. The entire world faces “a moment of peril” but also “a moment of opportunity” Biden declared speaking from a TV-style chrome-blue set for the virtual summit of 40 world leaders. Participants appeared one after the other onscreen for what appeared to be a mix of live and recorded addresses. Mexico’s drought reaches critical levels as lakes dry up Drought conditions now cover 85% of Mexico and residents of the nation’s central region said Thursday that lakes and reservoirs are simply drying up including the country’s second-largest body of fresh water. The mayor of Mexico City said the drought was the worst in 30 years and the problem can be seen at the reservoirs that store water from other states to supply the capital. Some of them like the Villa Victoria reservoir west of the capital are at one-third of their normal capacity with a month and a half to go before any significant rain is expected. Isaías Salgado 60 was trying to fill his water tank truck at Villa Victoria a task that normally takes him just half an hour. On Thursday he estimated it was taking 3 1/2 hours to pump water into his 10000-liter tanker. “The reservoir is drying up” said Salgado. “If they keep pumping water out by May it will be completely dry and the fish will die.” Expedition hauls tons of plastic out of remote Hawaii atolls A crew returned from the northernmost islands in the Hawaiian archipelago this week with a boatload of marine plastic and abandoned fishing nets that threaten to entangle endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other animals on the uninhabited beaches stretching more than 1300 miles north of Honolulu. The cleanup effort in Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument lasted three weeks and the crew picked up more than 47 tons (43 metric tons) of “ghost nets” and other marine plastics such as buoys crates bottle caps and cigarette lighters from the shores of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The monument the largest protected marine reserve in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world is in the northern Pacific Ocean and surrounded by what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — a huge gyre of floating plastic and other debris that circulates in ocean currents. The islands act like a comb that gather debris on its otherwise pristine beaches. Restoring service central to Biden’s postal board nominees  President Joe Biden’s nominees to the governing board of the U.S. Postal Service pledged Thursday to rebuild trust with the American public through prompt deliveries as they outlined a vison for the agency in their first formal statements to lawmakers. The nominees — Ron Stroman a former deputy postmaster general; Amber McReynolds who leads the nonprofit National Vote at Home Institute; and Anton Hajjar the former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union — made the remarks during their confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The panel did not immediately vote on the nominations. The hearing marked the first step in a process that could reshape the board as Postmaster General Louis DeJoy pursues a controversial overhaul of mail operations following outrage last year over delivery slowdowns. If approved by the committee then the full Senate the nominees would give Democrats and Democratic appointees a majority on the board. US jobless claims fall to 547000 another pandemic low The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid fell last week to 547000 the lowest point since the pandemic struck and an encouraging sign that layoffs are slowing on the strength of an improving job market. The Labor Department said Thursday that applications declined 39000 from a revised 586000 a week earlier. Weekly jobless claims are down sharply from a peak of 900000 in early January. At the same time they’re still far above the roughly 230000 level that prevailed before the viral outbreak ripped through the economy in March of last year. “With 135 million Americans having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination and the economy opening up more each day the number of job opportunities will continue to rise” said James Knightley chief international economist at ING a European bank. Al Jazeera News Russia to pull back troops from Ukraine border Russia will on Friday begin returning troops to permanent bases inside the country pulling them back from near the border with Ukraine Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reported. Thursday’s announcement comes after weeks of tensions between Moscow Kyiv and the latter’s Western allies over a major Russian military build-up near its western border with Ukraine and in annexed Crimea which reportedly involved tens of thousands of troops. Russia has argued that the build-up was defensive while Ukraine – backed by Germany and other Western powers – has accused Moscow of attempting to provoke hostilities. Aguililla: The Mexican town in the crossfires of a cartel war A dirt road nestled in the mountains is the only way to get to Aguililla a Mexican town caught in the middle of a turf war between two drug cartels. Located in the southwestern state of Michoacan checkpoints surround the entrances to the town guarded by armed men. For weeks the Jalisco New Generation cartel Mexican officials say have been battling for control with the rival United Cartels. And during the past several weeks they have closed off the main roads and laid siege to the town. “It’s affected us a lot” Maria Guadalupe Contreras who works at a local restaurant told Al Jazeera. “Everything has gotten more expensive it’s really hard to bring in supplies.” US House votes to make Washington DC the 51st state Democrats in the United States House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday to make the city of Washington DC the 51st US state. Voting along party lines with minority Republicans in opposition the House approved the bill 216-208. It now faces a tough fight in the US Senate where it is viewed by Republicans as a Democratic power grab. While the city’s 705000 residents are able to vote for candidates for US president they do not have voting representation in Congress and yet must pay taxes to the government. Making Washington DC a state would create new positions in Congress – one House representative and two senators – that all but certainly would be filled by Democrats as DC’s residents have historically voted for Democratic candidates in overwhelming numbers.

Politico California public universities plan to require Covid-19 vaccines California's two public university systems announced Thursday they will require nearly 800000 students to receive the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as this fall in the nation's most sweeping higher education testing requirement. California State University and University of California proposed the requirement for students faculty and staff for the fall 2021 semester — contingent on full FDA approval. All told the requirement could apply to more than 1 million people. Both UC and CSU are planning for mostly in-person instruction when the academic year begins in August.
