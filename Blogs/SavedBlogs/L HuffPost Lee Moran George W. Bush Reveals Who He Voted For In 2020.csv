L, George W. Bush Reveals Who He Voted For In 2020, Lee Moran, 2021-04-23, Former President George W. Bush has revealed who he voted for in the 2020 election. And it was neither then-President Donald Trump nor now-President Joe Biden. Instead Bush wrote in the name of Condoleezza Rice. “She knows it” Bush told People magazine in an interview published Thursday. “But she told me she would refuse to accept the office.” Rice served as Bush’s secretary of state from 2005 to 2009. She is now director of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Also in the interview with People Bush sought to clarify his criticism earlier this week of Trump-era Republicans who on the “Today” show he described as “isolationist protectionist and to a certain extent nativist.” “Really what I should have said — there’s loud voices who are isolationists protectionists and nativists something by the way I talked about when I was president” said the 43rd president who has made multiple media appearances this month to promote his new art book “Out of Many One: Portraits of Immigrants in America.” “My concerns (are) about those -isms” he added “but I painted with too broad a brush ... because by saying what I said it excluded a lot of Republicans who believe we can fix the problem.” Read Bush’s full interview with People here.
