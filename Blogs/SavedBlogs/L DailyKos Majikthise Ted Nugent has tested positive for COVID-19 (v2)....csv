L, Ted Nugent has tested positive for COVID-19 (v2)..., Majikthise, 2021-04-20, From the Daily Beast (edited to provide direct link): www.thedailybeast.com/... Ted Nugent—the right-wing singer who’s spent the past year boring on about his ridiculous coronavirus and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories—has announced that he’s fallen badly sick with COVID-19. Since the pandemic began last year Nugent has described it as a “scam” ridiculed mask-wearers as “sheep” and proudly announced that he would never take a coronavirus vaccine. But he changed his tune in a Facebook live on Monday when he complained to viewers: “I have had flu symptoms for the last 10 days. I thought I was dying. Just a clusterfuck. I was tested positive today. I got the Chinese shit. I’ve got a stuffed up head body aches. My God what a pain in the ass. I literally could hardly crawl out of bed the last few days.” NOTE The previous version of the diary was flagged for violating the Rules of the Road (not wishing for demise of anyone/invoking karma)… I’m not sure that I actually stepped over that line but I will be more careful with what I say here. For those unaware of who Ted Nugent is… long story short he’s a highly over-rated guitarist who had a few hits as a solo artist was in the briefly popular band “Damn Yankees” and now likes to wear cowboy hats and camo gear while brandishing assault rifles as he trolls the libs.  (His appropriation of military-themed garb is ironically hilarious since he is an admitted draft dodger.) My wife and her sisters all tested positive for COVID-19 back in October… several of my nieces nephews and cousins have tested positive.  I have been lucky in that none of my family have died from COVID-19 but I have lost a few friends/former coworkers to this terrible disease.  Most of the adult members of my family are fully vaccinated (I’m at 1 out of 2 shots (Moderna) myself).  Hopefully everyone reading this story is either vaccinated or will be soon. I certainly hope that Mr. Nugent makes a full recovery even though he is a truly awful shit-stain on the underpants of humanity.  I really don’t want to waste my time explaining or recounting the hundreds of times that Mr. Nugent’s actions and words have demonstrated that he is quite simply an awful human being with approximately 0.0023 redeeming qualities (rounded down). Time for the potential silver linings: As I said in the original version of the diary “science is true whether or not you believe in it” (believe that is originally from Neil deGrasse Tyson) — it seems that those who choose to engage in conspiracy theories about the virus and vaccines may end up providing an object lesson of the wisdom of that saying.
