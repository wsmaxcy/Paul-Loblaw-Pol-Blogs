L, It's called the "Big Lie" because Courts found No Evidence for their Fictional Fraud allegations, jamess, 2021-07-03, — IF there was “Any there THERE” — somebody would have found Evidence of it by now. They have NOT.  That’s because it was ALL one “Big Lie” … Judges again and again have ruled as much. Instead GOP groups for the most part have focused on smaller-bore complaints in an effort to delay the counting of ballots or claims that would affect a small fraction of votes at best. And even then they have largely lost in court. The reason: Judges have said the Republicans did not provide evidence to back up their assertions — just speculation rumors or hearsay. Or in one case hearsay written on a sticky note.  Republican observers were there after all. Trump had “a nonzero number of people in the room” one of his attorneys conceded in federal court Thursday evening. “I’m sorry then what’s your problem?” asked U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond who denied the request to halt the count.  In Northampton County Pa. for instance a judge wrote that the local GOP needed to prove why it would be injured if voters had a chance to correct their ballots. “As a result its request for an injunction must fail” wrote Judge Michael J. Koury Jr.  Republicans said they had “information and belief” that this curing process had been done repeatedly without a GOP official there to observe it. They asked a judge to delay certifying Detroit’s results. The judge said no. He said the GOP’s evidence of misconduct was “mere speculation.” “The City of Detroit should not be harmed when there is no evidence to support accusations of voter fraud” Judge Timothy M. Kenny wrote.  A judge rejected that saying that the GOP’s evidence was inadmissible as hearsay. The judge also said that — because Trump’s campaign had waited until late afternoon on Wednesday to file — its suit was moot.  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has said there is no evidence of wrongdoing: the ballots had indeed arrived before the deadline but a clerk had forgotten to save their arrival date in a computer file she said. “What she calls ‘backdating’ is simply dating. The actual date of receipt of the ballot was stamped on the envelope. We followed a proper process by putting that date into the system” said David Fink a private attorney representing the city of Detroit in the lawsuit. “The fact that it was done after the ballot was received has absolutely no significance.”  Georgia Democrats filed two affidavits from other poll workers who said they observed no such intermingling. A Georgia judge dismissed Trump’s suit in one day writing that there was “no evidence” the county elections board had failed to comply with the law.  The Trump allies wanted U.S. District Judge Andrew Gordon to order a ban on the use of a machine for verifying signatures a move that would have slowed down an already slow count. He did not. Instead Gordon told the plaintiffs to return to court if they found more evidence to back their claims. The plan was to get the Supreme Court to rule in favor of the Loser’s unfounded claims that “he had really won.” THEY DID NOT. The SCOTUS choose not to sully their court with such baseless nonsense ... by Reuters Staff — February 15 2021  On Nov 27 2020 a federal appeals court rejected a Trump campaign proposal to block Biden from being declared the winner of Pennsylvania. (here). At the time Stephanos Bibas on behalf of the three-judge panel wrote: “Free fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so." It added: “Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here."  [...] on Dec. 12 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a long-shot lawsuit by the state of Texas and backed by Trump which sought to throw out voting results in four states ( here ). In a brief order the justices said Texas did not have legal standing to bring the case.  On Dec. 1 then-Attorney General William Barr said that the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election [...]  Reuters Fact Check has debunked a series of similar false claims of election fraud. Some can be seen here here here here here. When the “Big Lie” is even TOO TOXIC for the professional cover-up artist Bill Barr — you know that their “fake allegations” — must be about a flimsy as Jenga Tower in a windstorm. As of Feb 22nd 2021 the professional conman still had yet to PROVE a SINGLE Election Fraud allegation in a court of law. In the world where logic still exists — that gives you an earth-shaking sense of their underlying credibility.   THEY HAVE NONE. Before the Capitol insurrection on January 6 Trump's claims alternated between demanding that some states stop counting ballots which he didn't have the power to do and saying that others should keep counting which they were doing anyway. To that end the Trump campaign Republican allies and Trump himself had mounted at least 42 legal challenges since Election Day. They've won zero. President Joe Biden was inaugurated on January 20. [...] Send this “Big Lie” List to anyone you know still mired in the “Cult of No Cred” ... from www.businessinsider.com — Feb 22 2021 Direct appeals to the Supreme Court — 3 losses Pennsylvania — 13 losses Nevada — 4 losses Georgia — 5 losses Michigan — 5 losses Arizona — 4 losses Wisconsin — 7 losses New Mexico — one loss Summaries of each of the frivolous lawsuits which the former guy flat-out loss are provided in that last link from Business Insider. IF there was “Any there THERE” — somebody would have found it by now. They have NOT. ... All they have found is a whole lot of whining and complaining from the King of COVID and from the “pathetic pawns” he deigns to call “friends” … . . . . . . . . . . … conditional friends of the Biggest Loser … and the most-failed conman … EVER.  __ __
