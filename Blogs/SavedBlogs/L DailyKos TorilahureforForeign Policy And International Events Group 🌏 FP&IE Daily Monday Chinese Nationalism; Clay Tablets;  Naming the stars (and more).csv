L, 🌏 FP&IE Daily Monday: Chinese Nationalism; Clay Tablets;  Naming the stars (and more), TorilahureforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-05-10, Welcome to the daily fresh all day adventure at “Foreign Policy and International Events Group” aka FP&IE. Join us on todays journey. Share links and stories of your discoveries and thought. Who are we and what we are trying do → Launching A Dailykos Discussions and Republishing Group For International or Foreign Policy Stuff We use sources and links that might not be familiar to most kossacks what with this being a Foreign Policy and International stuffs group and all. So press right mouse button on links and open in new incognito/private tab/window to reduce your tensions somewhat. Today’s presentation is a curated collection of articles opinion/editorial pieces from around the world covering Foreign Policy and Internation Events related stuff. There are so many articles each day that it gets harder to choose. In the overall arc in the context implicit assumption that entertainment industry  and culture export (or colonization if you prefer) play a large part in setting up sympathetic audience to particular narratives. Entertainment and exposure shape and entrench certain attitudes and view-points. These in turn garner support emphasize and perpetuate certain thoughts which have defined and influenced state policies (both domestic and foreign).  Behavioural science marketting arms and such have shown keen interest and exploited this power.  NIH (National Institute of Health) which might currently be known domestically because ofCovid-19 and previously non-descript civil servants and institutionals officers like Dr Fauci are now household names runs studies and publishes journals which have even recently included in it’s journal studies like this one by Tina Kubrak ( 20 May US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health) reasearch article Impact of Films: Changes in Young People’s Attitudes after Watching a Movie Those of us who grew up with the likes of Pinewood Hollywood Bollywood out of  Bush House (previously BBC Head Headquarters in London) and Ealing and Pinewood studios (UK cinema industry) MGM 20th Century Fox Disney Universal (US cinema industry)  30 Rockfeller Plaza (Comcast) might not realize or at least need a prod to remind ourselves the clout these have in terms of exporting ideas and enforcing certain viewpoint that is favourable to and an extension of the particular cultural trends. These are amplified by print/radio and other related media where cross-over of content is seamless. So these industries are not only bringing in money afterall  these are businesses they are also exporting view points and influencing how originating nations are viewed internationally. So we have for example  discordant scenarios like Santa Clause dressed in full iconic red/white winter outfit in middle of summer in Australian sub-sahara sub-equatorial Christmas trying not to passout from heat and dehydration. (A light-hearted photo library at IDAfrica: Father Christmas: 8 Things You Need To Know About African Santa). If you want to check out a fluffy woolly patronising piece to find out how christmas is celebrated aroudn teh globe  then try this Christmas Around the World. Valentine’s day in full throng celebrated across the world even in India where there are already plenty of ancient festivals dedicated to love and lovers. Roses as symbols of love replacing indigenous symbols locally like rhododendron carnations acacia amaranthm tulip and orchids to list just a few. Contribution towards negative stereotyping of certain population (insert whatever domestic and foreign population currently deemed as enemy) across the globe in negative terms have arisen from  how Hollywood portrayed those people in cinemas. Now with local industries taking shape and growing a conflict of view-points lead to a battlefronts of ideas where previously Hollyhood thus USA  had reigned supreme it is being challenged in unexpected ways. With that setting the backdrop for todays daily bulletin lets look at a few things Over at The Diplomat (08 May 2021) guest author Shiru Chen (Ph.D student in Political Science in the University of Toronto studying Chinese politics grassroots political participation and their unexpected combination with fandom culture in China) writes an thoroughly interesting article about rising Chinese nationalism How Chinese Fans Enforce Chinese Nationalism on the World “Speak Chinese or get out of China.” “This is China Speak Chinese.” “Speaking our language is the basic respect.” These are quotes from “Produce Camp” fans on Twitter one of the websites that are banned by China’s Great Fire Wall. The the popular boy group competition show held its fourth season and it’s “most global” iteration showing sponsor Tencent’s aim to build an international “idol team.” With trainees from Japan Thailand Taiwan Ukraine and Russia Tencent hopes to expand its overseas audience make the competition more competitive and raise the bar for the domestic “idol industry.” The debut stage of “Produce Camp 2021” has attracted a live audience of 52.38 million globally which is quite a success. The attempt to globalize the show however has had the surprising side effect of globalizing Chinese nationalism. This not a coincidence. Chinese nationalism is embedded in the show promoted by the trainees and manifested in the everyday interaction between Chinese and non-Chinese trainees. From the beginning of the show “Chinese elements” has been a selling point: trainees often wear Hanfu traditional Chinese clothing and perform on stages decorated by traditional Chinese style paintings folding fans and Chinese calligraphy. During the Chinese Lunar New Year 2021 all trainees were required to write spring couplets in brush calligraphy to show their understanding of Chinese culture. One of the long term historical “exporter” (conqueror colonizers empire builder or whatever) of culture and influence has had disproportionate impact to the point that others have wanted to emulate Roman elements. Of course last two centuries have a different ending and impact on perceptions. Nevertheless even now the sheer volume of tourism copying architecture dominance in fashion industry speaks volumes. Just think of designer labels and Italy springs to mind and association with Italy even if some of them are not based in Italy. Just take for example coffee. Italy is neither a producer of coffee (List of countries by coffee production) nor even the biggest consumer accounting for just under 8%  of import trade. It is a member of International Coffee Organization only as part of a unified European Union membership. However when you buy talk about coffee buy a coffee refer to coffee the language and expression fo coffee is uniquely Italian. Even when you hear “Italian Coffee” in a movie dialogue it immediately invokes associative thoughts of quality and luxury. Over at Modern Diplomacy (02 April 2021)  Ksenia Tabarintseva-Romanova citing recent developements in Russia-Italy relationghip by example of annual INNOPROM (large-scale international industrial exhibition annually held in Ekaterinburg Russia) writes Сultural diplomacy as an effective instrument of Italian soft power: the INNOPROM case Despite the complicated geopolitical rhetoric of European interaction with Russia and economic sanctions international life continues. In such conditions culture remains in fact the only instrument for supporting and developing international relations. International cultural relations strive to maintain “neutrality”. In the context of globalization the blurring of borders it is cultural policy that can become a point of mutual understanding finding a common language and preserving existing civilizational layers. Cultural diplomacy is a state policy aimed within the framework of foreign policy at the export of representative data of national culture and at interaction with other countries in the same cultural sphere. The tools for the implementation of cultural diplomacy are primarily used to form a positive foreign policy image of the country as well as indirectly for the development of intercultural dialogue sustainable development and conflict prevention and are associated with various areas of human activity: cinema religion science cultural exchanges literature theater etc. much more. As nations change society changes draughts wars conquests liberations through millenia. With deliberate manipulation of medium of knowledge and information and destruction of identity and history we ariive at bizzare situations where even the leader of the world the President of currently the sole  super-power  or the world make statements that obliterate or attempt to obliterate history to hide and whitewash their own current crimes against humanity. So they make pithy statements like “..our god that named the stars in heaven..” to invoke and start a war against the very people who actually named the stars in heaven That Gilgamesh our literature is so fond of referencing  that Gilgamesh people quote parody satirize and find so many novel ways of depicting and interpreting. The poetry written mellenia ago on clay tablets that will yet survive for many mellenia while all the paper turns to dust and all computers today will have been consigned to junk beautifully laminated preservations will have crumbled  even though our politicians insist those places have no merit worthy of mentioning and even some politicians claim those places contributed nothing to civilization. All the while we mourn the grief written on those tablets translated through millenia of many languages and today we reference the futility of our endeavours the short span of our individual importance and we invoke the poetry of places we have destroyed in the name of bringing civilization of all the places to the place that birthed civilization. The place with civilization was birthed we tolerate such ideas we accept such depictions. Such is the power of  narratives and contemporary depictions that obliterate facts and ignore history. We treat such revelations that have been embedded in our language and literature as if they were a  surprise. Over at Psyche Ancient Akkadian poems and medical texts reveal grief’s universals  Along a dried-up channel of the Euphrates river in modern-day Iraq broken mud bricks poke out of vast dusty ruins. They are the remains of Uruk the birthplace of writing that’s better known in popular culture today as the city once ruled by the legendary king Gilgamesh the hero of an epic about his struggle with life love and death. Sometimes called the oldest story in the world the Epic of Gilgamesh continues to resonate with modern audiences more than 3000 years after a Babylonian scholar named Sîn-leqi-unninni picked up his reed stylus and in the tiny tetrahedrons of cuneiform script impressed a standardised version of the epic on to 12 clay tablets. Written in a literary dialect of the Akkadian language spoken in ancient Mesopotamia it’s this version that has survived on fragmentary clay copies – some as big as an iPad and others as little as a fingertip – uncovered from sites throughout what is now Iraq Syria and neighbouring countries. The story is equal parts hero’s journey and crash course in Mesopotamian cosmology as Gilgamesh follows the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to their source beyond the known world in search of a survivor of the apocalyptic Flood named Uta-napishti. Fundamentally it tells of Gilgamesh’s transformation from cruel to kindly king. Central to this is his relationship with Enkidu a wild man who was sent by the gods to temper Gilgamesh’s tyrannical rule and who becomes his closest friend and lover. The pair undertake a series of adventures together that culminates in their slaughtering of the Bull of Heaven a fiery creature plucked from the constellation Taurus. For this act the gods decide to punish them by taking Enkidu’s life and in many ways this is where the epic begins as Enkidu’s death launches Gilgamesh’s quest for the antediluvian secret to immortality. That quest sees him traverse the mythical landscape of ancient Mesopotamia and the region’s linguistic landscape of emotional distress. Following Gilgamesh’s journey reminds anyone who has ever grieved that they’re not alone – the experience of extreme loss transcends the millennia-long gap between what it meant to be human then and what it means now. Gilgamesh’s initial reaction to Enkidu’s death is a heart-rending picture of misery. Staring at the fresh body he screams: ‘Now what sleep has seized you?’ and reaches out to feel for a heartbeat. When he finds nothing he pulls a veil over Enkidu’s face. He paces back and forth like a lioness who has lost her cubs he pulls out his hair and tears off his clothes. For seven days and nights he weeps over Enkidu and refuses to allow him to be taken for burial until a maggot crawls out of the decomposing corpse’s nose. Following an elaborate funeral he continues to weep bitterly and takes to roaming the wild steppe outside Uruk’s walls. ‘Sorrow has entered my belly’ he declares. ‘I became afraid of death and go wandering the wild.’ Anyone who has suffered the pain of loss will see themselves in this scene. We have out expectations set up in a way which sometimes result in unpleasant surprises to our protected and delicately nurtured view points that ignore the history. So that brings me to the closing thoughts from Al Jazeera: What is our art doing in their capitals?  Where do priceless works of art belong – where they were created where they were plundered or where they were eventually sold and museumised?  I have had occasions before on these pages to argue why cliche East vs West binaries need to yield to conceptions of art beyond artificial borders – that the very works of art we love and celebrate must be allowed to reimagine our geographies. Recently I was reminded of that argument once again when a new book brought the question of “Western art collections” in “non-Western capitals” back into the art and design pages of the New York Times. Donna Stein’s book The Empress and I: How an Ancient Empire Collected Rejected and Rediscovered Modern Art was published in February 2021. It received a detailed review in the New York Times a month later. Hired by the Empress of Art at Tehran’s Hidden Museum reads the provocative title of the essay by the Times’s veteran Iran specialist Elaine Sciolino. “Donna Stein in her score-settling memoir reveals how she helped Farah Diba Pahlavi create a museum whose collection is valued at $3 billion today.” Enjoy The day If you’re not already following Foreign Policy and International Events (FP&IE) please go to our homepage (link) find the Follow Group button in the left margin and click it to FOLLOW GROUP.
