Deputies were executing a search warrant Wednesday morning in Elizabeth City when Andrew Brown Jr. was shot the Pasquotank County sheriff said. The sheriff Tommy Wooten offered few other details about what happened and said the State Bureau of Investigation is taking the lead. Brown was 42 years old online records show. He was a father of 10 WAVY reported. Brown’s son Khalil Ferebee said his father didn’t own guns according to the The Virginian-Pilot. “He wasn’t a violent person” Daniel Bowser who said he and Brown were friends for nearly 30 years told The News & Observer. “He didn’t mess with guns he didn’t tote no guns. News&Observer April has been a cruel month for North Carolina’s transgender community. As the General Assembly debates bills that would exclude them from sports teams bar them from health care and protect discrimination against them by doctors the community is also mourning the murder of two young black trans women in Charlotte. These crises are linked LGBTQ advocates say. Anti-transgender rhetoric and legislation drives the rising violence in North Carolina and nationwide against transgender people many of whom already face staggering health and social inequities. “Being a Black trans woman in America means you’re far more likely to experience inequities and prejudice including extreme poverty and systemic state-sanctioned violence and murder” said Rebby Kern director of education policy for Equality NC at a press conference this week. “The Black transgender and gender-nonconforming community experiences unemployment twice as a high as the rate for non-Black transgender people and four times as high as cisgender people” Kern said. “They experience houselessness at a rate five times higher than cisgender people and experience poverty at a rate eight times higher than cisgender people.” The state has a list of agencies and pharmacies who will vaccinate people in their homes for COVID-19 but the list has some holes It’s become easier and easier for most people to find available COVID-19 vaccine appointments but getting vaccinated poses a particular challenge for homebound seniors. Getting homebound residents vaccinated involves coordination – connecting organizations that know where they are with vaccine providers said Charlene Wong chief health policy officer for COVID-19 at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. More than 100 vaccine providers are making home visits Wong said and people who need them are being identified by area programs on aging faith groups and others. “We’re working hard to try to get more folks to get COVID-19 vaccine in a way that’s safe for them” she said. They’re also thinking about how to vaccinate caregivers for whom getting out can be a challenge she said. Estimates on how many people are homebound vary widely but there could be as many as 200000 or more people in North Carolina who cannot leave or rarely leave their homes. 9:58 AM BAILEY ALDRIDGE We’re tracking the most up-to-date information about the coronavirus and vaccines in North Carolina.
