L, Democracy at Stake:  The NYT Editorial Board seems to get it., LaFeminista, 2021-07-02, By “it” I mean the threat to American Democracy. The 1965 Voting Rights Act was one of the most important pieces of legislation in American history. By outlawing racial discrimination in voting and imposing federal oversight in states with histories of discriminating it finally enforced the 15th Amendment and marked the first time the nation could call itself a truly representative democracy. Until the last decade the law occupied a sacred spot in the American legal system. In 2006 Congress reauthorized the law nearly unanimously. The use of was rather than is telling in my opinion. Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act which bars any law that discriminates on the basis of race whether intentionally or not the Arizona laws should have been invalidated. But the conservative justices dismissed the challenge because they said only a small number of people were affected. “The mere fact that there is some disparity in impact does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in an opinion joined by the other conservatives. Only a small number might be disenfranchised in a democracy? Since the court is talking about “mere facts” the conservative justices might have noted the mere fact that voting fraud which lawmakers in a number of states claim they are trying to prevent with laws like the ones in Arizona is essentially nonexistent. As one federal judge put it several years ago such laws are akin to using “a sledgehammer to hit either a real or imaginary fly on a glass coffee table Conservatives from top to bottom have a serious mental problem with reality and facts. The strategy is so dangerous because it is so dull. They are trying to keep this attack on our still more or less functioning democracy as boring as possible by keeping it administrative disenfranchisement. The current conservative majority on the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Roberts shows no interest in thwarting this attack on democracy and protecting Americans’ fundamental constitutional right to vote. The ball is in Congress’s court and time is fast running out. Make no mistake this is only the beginning of the current round of attacks. By the time non-boring attacks take place it will be too damn late. This is a fight Congressional Republicans are nobody's friend it’s time some Democrats woke the fuck up because the anti-democratic forces are winning this round. A politicized and religiously motivated Supreme Court was the first step.
