L, Top Comments: Super Pink Moon (Music) Edition, brilligforTop Comments, 2021-04-26, Tonight is the first of several (at least two and some sources say four) supermoons we’ll see in 2021. A Supermoon is a full moon that coincides with perigee —  the moon’s closest point to Earth each monthly orbit. Many cultures names the moons based on natural events occuring at the particular time of year; this month is known as the Pink Moon because the moss pink herb or wild ground phlox flower is generally widespread by this point in spring. As an intro to another week of Top Comments let’s hop below the story break and bring on the Moon Music! Songs referencing MOON in the title or lyrics. I’ll get us started (I definitely have some favorites!!) and please share your best-loved lunar lullabies in the comments!   Here at Top Comments we welcome longtime as well as brand new Daily Kos readers to join us at 10pm Eastern. We strive to nourish community by rounding up some of the site's best funniest most mojo'd & most informative commentary and we depend on your help!! If you see a comment by another Kossack that deserves wider recognition please send it either to topcomments at gmail or to the Top Comments group mailbox by 9:30pm Eastern. Please please please include a few words about why you sent it in as well as your user name (even if you think we know it already :-)) so we can credit you with the find! In no particular order:    and lastly (for me at least there’s so much more to choose from)…  And now on to  tonight’s trio of Top Comments Mojo and Pictures!  Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down. Please remember that comment inclusion in Top Comments does not constitute support or endorsement by diarist formatter Top Comments writers or DailyKos. Questions complaints or comments? Contact brillig. It was a completely quiet and empty mailbox. That means y’all are working on tons of submissions for tomorrow right? RIGHT?
