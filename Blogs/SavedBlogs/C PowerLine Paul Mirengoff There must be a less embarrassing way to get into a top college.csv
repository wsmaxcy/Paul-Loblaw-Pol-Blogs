C, There must be a less embarrassing way to get into a top college, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-05-28, Stuffed animals seem to play an important part in the lives of a surprisingly large number of left-wing students. Apparently they make these students  feel safe. As safe as Play Doh does maybe even safer. According to  this report a stuffed animal even helped a black teenager gain admission to Princeton: 
An inspiring essay about his childhood stuffed animal helped a New Jersey high school senior get into 20 colleges including 6 schools in the Ivy League. He chose to attend Princeton. Chris Butcher 18 says a stuffed dalmatian named Bigdog played a huge part in him getting accepted to 20 colleges but more importantly helped him come to terms with his Blackness. . . . “When I had negative encounters and whatnot I would come home and if I was sitting on my bed Bigdog was there. He’s a reassuring object for me” Butcher said. . . . He felt so defeated in his junior year that he broke down and once again he turned to Bigdog for help. It was then Butcher had a realization writing “If I did not let Bigdog’s decaying structure define his worth I was not going to let my Black skin define mine.”
 Maybe college admissions offices at elite institutions like Princeton’s should come equipped with stuffed animals to teach the decisionmakers not to let skin color define applicants’ worth. These days skin color is worth hundreds of SAT points and a nice boost to your GPA if you’re Black. It will detract from how the admissions office evaluates your worth if you’re White or Asian.  A childish essay like Butcher’s can also provide a boost especially if it invokes race but black skin is worth far more. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
