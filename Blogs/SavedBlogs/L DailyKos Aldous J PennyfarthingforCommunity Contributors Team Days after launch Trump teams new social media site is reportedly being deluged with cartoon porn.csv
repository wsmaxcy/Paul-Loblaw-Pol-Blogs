L, Days after launch Trump team's new social media site is reportedly being deluged with cartoon porn, Aldous J PennyfarthingforCommunity Contributors Team, 2021-07-03, Well “cartoon porn” is a pretty good thumbnail description of Donald Trump’s life so this feels appropriate. The oafish offal heap who cosplayed as president for that big chunk of my life when I could’ve been enjoying a nice soothing coma now has a new option for his social media home. Because Twitter and Facebook won’t have him you see. You may have heard something about that. Jason Miller who long ago parlayed his modest fame as a three-dimensional Wooly Willy into a spokesperson job with the white supremacist whale is behind the site. Miller is also the guy who may or may not have spiked his girlfriend’s drink with an abortion pill. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is this new antisocial media platform Get Her (styled as GETTR) is apparently a haven for hentai—also known as anime porn. Mother Jones: “Welcome to GETTR and start a new journey!” So reads an introductory message on the home page of Gettr a right-wing social media app recently launched by a team led by Jason Miller an ex-spokesperson of former president Donald Trump. That “new journey” thanks to spam comments left en masse below the message involves encountering things like anime porn and repeated copies of an image depicting Hillary Clinton’s head photoshopped onto another woman’s nude body. Well to be fair Trump’s bedroom probably includes fake nude Hillary pics. The guy can’t shut the fuck up about her. He’s obviously crushing. Major social media platforms like Twitter Facebook and its image-sharing subsidiary platform Instagram have automated filters that root out and remove or censor nude images. At the moment the Trump-linked social media app apparently has nothing of the kind. It has nothing of the kind because it’s a clown show. Or will be as soon as the clown fetish porn starts pouring in. If anime porn were the “worst” thing this platform can expect it would merely be amusing. But no. This thing promises to be a Mos Eisley-level hive of scum and villainy.  While Mike Lindell’s FrankSpeech has somehow been unable to implement any actual social media features it has featured a vast kollection of kookaburra klowns posting video after video. Imagine when rando Trump fans start piling into GETTR. Visiting it will seem a bit like reading Little Golden Books on acid. So we’ll see where this goes. I predict “nowhere fast.” Then again Trump’s blog which Miller also had his fingers in was a HUGE success before he abruptly and unceremoniously shut it down. Or so he claimed anyway.  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter that is). What is it? The viral letter that launched four hilarious Trump-trolling books. Get them all including the finale Goodbye Asshat: 101 Farewell Letters to Donald Trump at this link. Just $12.96 for the pack of 4!
