L, What in Hades is this?, abluerippleinohio, 2021-06-27, Good Sunday morning good people! There are some people that will try you. I'll be very clear and specific. Michael Santiago Render (aka Killer Mike) former Ohio State senator Nina Turner and Cenk Uygur have worked my last reserved nerve attacking House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. Take a good look at this. Here are the responses. Killer Mike & Nina Turner IDGAF about how much u dislike President Joe Biden! But one thing I will not tolerate is you disrespecting Jim Clyburn PERIODT!!! @KillerMike @ninaturner #oh11 https://t.co/bl3L1Mqjdw pic.twitter.com/mNaEqhAKBz  WATCH Killer Mike call Elder Deacon Jim Clyburn “STUPID” but “with love..” at a Town Hall for Nina Turner hosted by TYTalso watch Turner “amen” Killer Mike as he accuses Dems of being paid to NOT work for the people A vote for Turner is a vote against the Biden Harris agenda pic.twitter.com/PeTn1N663G  Ok this is the big difference in this race. I admire what Congressman Clyburn has accomplished and the progress he delivered. Thanks to his endorsement of @JoeBiden we sent Trump packing and now Biden is leading a bold recovery and tackling historic inequalities. https://t.co/IPmXtUjapk  Let me address the disrespect towards House Majority Whip Clyburn. How dare you three disrespect House Majority Whip Clyburn!! Were any of you three there while he risked his life to vote? Were any of you a part of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee? Were any of you three doing anything for the communities that you inhabit besides bumping your gums? What have you contributed besides ratfucking elections?  I said what I said!
