L, Morning Open Thread - Random photos., CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-06-29, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. There are days when you don’t feel like interacting and that is okay.  You can stand by or sit down to share in the company of others.  No pressure here.  Blurt out some thought if you feel the urge.   Join us please. When you clean out closets and tidy up the house you can find things that will distract from chores.  My wife has begun her pre-retirement nesting.  She found a box of my old photos and wanted me to explain some of them.  This is just a few of the many I was quizzed about. I was walking perimeter of the ammo storage after the Red Brigade had bombed the US air base in Frankfurt.  36 hour duty for every body was the order. My first “gun ship”.  She was fast and sleek.  She had some air time in Nam but few scars. Hallowed ground for young men and women lost during an unholy time in history.  I was glad I made the visit to pay my respects.  Not the usual photo for this iconic site.  I didn’t want to be distracted when I stepped off the tour bus. 16 foot diameter on the inside and was cozy quarters for my group of young men.  We could erect the teepee in 15 minutes and tear it down in 7.  Mobility was our skill. A dozen wrenches a few screwdrivers pliers and a hammer is all I needed to keep this truck alive.  She would go any where and looked stylish in her faded powder blue color with rusty highlights. A part time job when I worked as a full time land surveyor.  I had a lot more energy then.  * This is a work day for me so I will be here from 5:30 to 7:00 am this morning.  I will return after 4 pm to review today’s responses from any and all that participate.  Be kind and thoughtful and have great fun.
