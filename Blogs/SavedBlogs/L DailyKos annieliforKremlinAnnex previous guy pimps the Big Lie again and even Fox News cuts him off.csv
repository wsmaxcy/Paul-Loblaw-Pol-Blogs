L, previous guy pimps the Big Lie again and even Fox News cuts him off, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-06-30, Previous guy says “Maybe we won’t have to” run again for the presidency. Fox did not carry the current President’s infrastucture remarks live on air yesterday but the network has found time this afternoon to carry the former President's border stunt today.  Although Fox News had heavily promoted the former president's trip to Texas throughout the day the network decided to cancel the president's press conference about a minute after he claimed the voting system in America is a "disaster." "We had an election where we did much better than we did the first time and amazingly we lost" Trump complained while sitting next to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). "I just want to thank the people of Texas because we won in a landslide. It wasn't even close." www.rawstory.com/... Trump continues to lie about the election at the border with Gov. Abbott. It’s almost July.  Pres Trump at the border alongside @GregAbbott_TX who just observed that Trump did more than any President *ever* to secure the southern border of the United States.  In mere months Biden turned the most secure border in our history to the single most dire border catastrophe. pic.twitter.com/76rDkVoIqs  Trump is touting a section of border wall that you can see is obviously unfinished if you just look behind him pic.twitter.com/2ZKou30d1b  Imagine having the empty soul of Greg Abbott to be able to sit there and smile like an idiot while this lunatic talks about his cognitive test like it was a freaking Mensa IQ test and not a means to see if he is losing his mind because everyone thought he was. https://t.co/EnrC6lMl9I  TX Gov. Abbott and his staff are blocking press access to his event today with Trump. They’ve decided to turn their roundtable discussion into a “pool” coverage event. However in addition to pool Abbott’s team is selectively allowing certain non-pool outlets into the event. pic.twitter.com/9MNOvfLU1Z   Every piece of evidence since the November election suggests Donald Trump made significant inroads among blocs of voters thought to be out of reach to the controversial now-former president. And he still lost the popular vote by roughly twice the margin he did in 2016 — enough for Joe Biden to flip five states Trump won and capture the Electoral College. A new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows why: Even as Trump was narrowing Democrats’ margins with white women and Hispanic voters Biden was surging with other groups like suburbanites white men and voters who identified as independents that propelled him to victory. Pew’s survey of “validated voters” — members of their survey panel whom they could match as people who cast ballots on state voter files — is among the deepest analyses of who voted in the last presidential election and how. And because Pew also conducted similar studies of the 2016 and 2018 electorates it’s possible to track how both parties’ coalitions evolved across the Trump era — and where the battle lines for the 2022 midterm elections may fall. www.politico.com/... Trump won white women by a larger spread in 2020 (7 points) than he won them in 2016 (2 points) but a new analysis from the Pew Research Center shows why he still lost the election https://t.co/IbbszYgnnD
