L, Lindsey Graham Mocked After Making Bizarre ‘Trump Cult’ Prediction About GOP’s Future, Ed Mazza, 2021-05-07, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) weighed in on the looming Republican purge of Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from House leadership over her opposition to former President Donald Trump. Cheney is the latest victim of conservative cancel culture as she’s reportedly on the verge of losing her position as conference chair the number three Republican in the House due to her criticism of the former president.  But Graham wasn’t all that sympathetic to her plight.  “Can we move forward without President Trump? The answer is no” he said on Fox News on Thursday night. “I’ve always liked Liz Cheney but she’s made the determination that the Republican Party can’t grow with President Trump. I’ve determined we can’t grow without him.”  On MSNBC above commentator Jason Johnson of Morgan State University said Graham was singing a familiar tune. “He sounds like a ’90s R&B singer like ’I can’t go on I can’t imagine my future without you” Johnson said. “As usual Lindsey Graham has about as much political integrity and stability as a weather vane.”   And on Twitter Graham’s critics were quick to similarly call him out:  🎶Tell me how am I supposed to live without you?Now that I've been loving you so longHow am I supposed to live without youAnd how am I supposed to carry on?When all that I've been livin' for is gone...🎵 https://t.co/sW2Ce1QsgE Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham have definitely played Boar on the Floor at Mar-a-Lago. https://t.co/fboPTYwxNF No Lindsey. The Republican Party won’t grow with Trump. The party will only SHRINK with Trump. https://t.co/57paKEhi2v clearest admission the republican party is now merely a trump cult https://t.co/46Xabbo3s0 This is refreshingly honest. Partly because he views her as making a tactical determination as opposed to a moral one (possibly true!) and also because this logic is independent of any moral considerations whatsoever. https://t.co/JdUErOcOXm In two tries Donald Trump never managed to get even 47% of the popular vote and yet Lindsey Graham thinks the GOP can't live without him. That is such a grim commentary on the state of the Republican Party. https://t.co/gAzlpya9up This is the most pathetic thing I've seen. Lindsey Graham clearly had his spine surgically removed. No other explanation. https://t.co/9YzXPP7SEt @LindseyGrahamSC Tonight Lindsey and Sean go full CULT. https://t.co/UrX6BdcdZA Lindsey Graham is a failure.Trump will not save Republican ideals. He doesn't even share them. He's actively undermining everything a democratic republic represents. He wants a cult of personality and he will destroy US to get it. He must be stopped at all costs. "We can't grow without him" Lindsey Graham says of the guy who presided over losses in the House Senate and White House. https://t.co/0quU1l67wy They are all in on authoritarianism and national populism. They are not a serious party anymore and this pathetic husk of an empty chicken suit is the living proof. https://t.co/c57DPkcCUo The media won’t call this party fascist until they put out a press release calling themselves fascist and even then I duno https://t.co/NuWF6nfmLk
