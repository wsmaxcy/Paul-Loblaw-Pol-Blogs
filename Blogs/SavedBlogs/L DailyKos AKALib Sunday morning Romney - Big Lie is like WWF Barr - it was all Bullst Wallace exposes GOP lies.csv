L, Sunday morning: Romney - Big Lie is like WWF Barr - it was all Bulls**t Wallace exposes GOP lies, AKALib, 2021-06-27, Here are some of the key moments from today’s Sunday morning talk shows on television. First we have Mitt Romney’s appearance with Jake Tapper on CNN. When prodded by Tapper Romney minced no words denouncing trump’s Big Lie calling it “a bit like WWF”. "Here in the US there's a growing recognition that this is a bit like WWF -- that it's entertaining but it's not real...I think people recognize it's a lot of show & bombast but it's going nowhere. The election is over. It was fair" -- Romney on Trump's lies about the election pic.twitter.com/S277i7SN6O Some snippets from the interview — Tapper: Former president Trump had held a rally last night in Ohio targeted at a congressman a Republican congressman who voted to impeach him. He kept pushing last night again the big lie that the 2020 election was rigged. This all comes as Arizona Republicans are completing their ridiculous partisan audit and other states are saying they will do the same and Bill Barr called it in the Atlantic magazine pardon my french 'bullshit' from the former attorney general. Do these repeated lies about the election whitewashing what happened January 6th do you think it undermines American democracy? If so do you think more of your Republican colleagues need to speak out? Romney: Well I do think it's important for each person to speak the truth and to make clear that the big lie is exactly that. I can tell you that it is surely being used around the world to minimize the support for democracy. Romney: I think frankly Jake a growing recognition in the U.S. is this is like WWF that it's entertaining but it's not real. And I know people want to say yeah they believe in the big lie in some cases but I think people recognize it's a lot of show and bombast but it's going to nowhere. The election is over -- it was fair. Romney: Look the president was crying foul on election night and actually before election night and the question is: what were his sources of information? Where did he hear that the election had been fraudulently carried out? Did he hear it from the Justice Department? No. Did he hear it from the intelligence community? No. So where did he hear it from? The MyPillow guy? Rudy Giuliani? What are their sources of information? It's pretty clear the election was fair and not the outcome the president wanted but let's move on. Romney went on to make some statements about President Biden which is making right-wingers go ballistic - "I don't agree with the president on a lot of policy fronts" Sen. Mitt Romney tells @jaketapper. "But do I take him at his word and do I think he's a man of honor? Absolutely." #CNNSOTU Over at Fox “News” Chris Wallace continues to shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of empty-headed republicans. Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) came prepared to the interview with vacuous talking points totally detached from reality and got taken to the cleaners by Wallace. Chris Wallace nails Rep. Jim Banks on how hypocritical it is for him to allege that Democrats are the anti-police party while he and all other Republicans vote against legislation providing cities and states with funding for more and better policing pic.twitter.com/1fMMiNIuTU  Wallace: In the program that he announced this week the president said that the central part of his anti-crime package is the $350 billion in the American Rescue Plan -- the COVID relief plan. Congressman Banks you voted against that package against that $350 billion just like every other Republican in the House and Senate. Can't you make the argument that it's you and the Republicans who are defunding the police? As Rep. Banks started regurgitation his talking points Wallace interrupted ... Wallace: Respectfully sir respectfully I heard you make that point but I'm asking you -- there's $350 billion in this package the president says can be used for policing. Banks then robotically went on to finish his memorized sentences. Also twitter is abuzz with Bill Barr’s interview with Jonathan D. Karl at The Atlantic where Barr is trying to whitewash the stains on his so-called reputation by stating about the Big Lie — “We realized from the beginning it was just bullshit." Barr reversed DOJ policy in Nov with his memo directing prosecutors to conduct “Post-Election Voting Irregularity Inquiry.” He now says his “suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.” Yet he delayed in saying so. https://t.co/4DvtchhwLO Yeah where were these statements when the country and Democracy were being set on fire by the trump and his enablers? Jonathan D. Karl is the chief Washington correspondent for ABC News. His book on the last days of the Trump administration Betrayal will be published on November 16 2021. Some more insightful excerpts from the article — My attitude was: It was put-up or shut-up time” Barr told me. “If there was evidence of fraud I had no motive to suppress it. But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.” Barr to trump: You keep on saying that the Department of Justice is not looking at this stuff and we are looking at it in a responsible way. But your people keep on shoveling this shit out.” “You know you only have five weeks Mr. President after an election to make legal challenges” Barr said. “This would have taken a crackerjack team with a really coherent and disciplined strategy. Instead you have a clown show. No self-respecting lawyer is going anywhere near it. It’s just a joke. That’s why you are where you are.” Now the following is a bizarre conversation - “I think you’ve noticed I haven’t been talking to you much” Trump said to him (Barr). “I’ve been leaving you alone.” Barr later told others that the comment was reminiscent of a line in the movie Dr. Strangelove in which the main character Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper says “I do not avoid women Mandrake but I do deny them my essence.” Trump Barr thought was saying that he had been denying him his essence. Trump brought up Barr’s AP interview. “Did you say that?” “Yes” Barr responded. “How the fuck could you do this to me? Why did you say it?” “Because it’s true.” The president livid responded by referring to himself in the third person: “You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump.” Yes these statements are too little too late but every little bit helps. Let’s use these words to neutralize trump McConnell and the right-wing machinery. The dark monster called the republican party and the stranglehold that trump and his lunatic supporters have on the GOP is still lurking out there chipping away at our Democracy and our national sanity. Let’s keep exposing their lies and let’s keep working to win the House and the Senate in 2022.
