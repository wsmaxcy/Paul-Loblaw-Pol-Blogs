L, Not all gig industries are evil don't let ABC test of Pro Act kill mine., CASnyder, 2021-04-19, The ABC test of the PRO act will kill my Green career and income and it is likely going to kill my Green New Deal worthy entire Passive House industry too which has almost no profit margin for its independent contractor workers as the super efficient buildings we certify the performance of are competing against barely code compliant buildings that have no energy certification requirements at all. I’m an independent contractor (by choice not exploited) in a worker’s cooperative that checks the energy calculations of super efficient buildings built to the international Passive House Standard. There is almost no one who is an independent contractor today who can pass the ABC test for remaining an independent contractor; for instance as applied in California the “A” test is interpreted that if your client hires you and so much as gives you a deadline for the completion of your work (name one client who doesn’t) they are considered to be “controlling” how you do the work and therefore you are considered to be an “employee” of your client rather than an independent contractor. Every one of our clients has projects requiring a very few hours of our work (a gig which we bid on) and our cooperative has to competitively bid for the work against businesses in other countries that have much more advantageous business environments. We need to be able to perform the work of our gigs and get paid just what we bid to do the work; if our cooperative had to pay us and provide benefits as employees with set hours of work whether or not the jobs came in we would have to close our Cooperative before it was bankrupted. Nor can any of us worker/ owners in our Cooperative afford to go it alone as the cooperative allows us to share the overhead expenses thus reducing them per capita and allowing us by a very slim margin to stay in the black. We have no owners in our cooperative who are not workers too and we all get paid in the same hourly rate for Additional Services beyond the scope of work in the contracts we bid. There are no profits for our cooperative what little surplus $ is left over at the end of the accounting year is divided up among us all in proportion to the amount of work we performed. So in trying to punish corps who exploit “gig” workers you will also be killing some very fragile and beneficial Green New Deal industries that can do a lot to avert runaway climate change. The Pro Act could easily be salvaged so that it doesn’t hurt those of us who are independent contractors by changing it so that the current IRS test of independent contractor status is used instead of the impossibly flawed ABC test that would make us all into “employees” whether we want to be or not. So many California businesses and independent contractors have been wrecked by the ABC test please do not allow it to kill a gig industry that is helping to fight off climate change. I would appreciate it if you can call your Senators to ask them to make sure the Senate version of the Pro Act does not include the ABC test but instead uses the IRS test to determine who is an independent contractor and to not vote for the Pro Act to become law if it contains the ABC test.
