Ralph Northam in the June 8 Democratic primary. The six-person field also includes another pro-choice woman Norfolk City Council member Andria McClellan. TX-06: Texas' 6th Congressional District will kick off this year's first competitive special election for the House on Saturday though we'll almost certainly have to wait until an as-yet-unscheduled runoff before we know the winner. That's because under state law all candidates from all parties are running together on a single ballot. In the event that no one captures a majority—which is all but certain given the enormous 23-person field—the top two vote-getters regardless of party will advance to a second round. Exactly who that lucky twosome might be is difficult to say given the paucity of recent polling and in any event the difficulty of accurately surveying the electorate in a special election like this one. The few polls we have seen have all found the same two contenders at the top of the heap: Republican Susan Wright the widow of the late Rep. Ron Wright (whose death in February triggered this election) and Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez the party's 2018 nominee who lost to the former congressman by a closer-than-expected 53-45 margin. The numbers have all been extremely tight however and "undecided" has always remained the most popular choice while several other candidates have trailed closely behind the frontrunners. On the Republican side the more notable names include state Rep. Jake Ellzey former Trump administration official Brian Harrison and former WWE wrestler Dan Rodimer (who lost a bid for Congress in Nevada last year). For Democrats also in the mix are educator Shawn Lassiter and businesswoman Lydia Bean who unsuccessfully ran for a nearby state House district in 2020. Wright earned what's typically the most important endorsement in GOP circles these days when Donald Trump gave her his blessing on Monday which could be enough to propel her to the runoff on its own. However early voting had already been underway been underway for a week potentially blunting the announcement's effectiveness. What's more Wright's top Republican rivals led by Ellzey have all outraised her. The top outside spender in the race the Club for Growth also seems to view Ellzey as a threat since it's put at least $260000 into TV ads attacking him. Two other super PACs meanwhile have spent $350000 to boost Ellzey. There's been less third-party activity on the Democratic side with two groups spending about $100000 on behalf of Sanchez who raised $299000 in the first quarter compared to $322000 for Lassiter and $214000 for Bean. The biggest concern for Democrats right now may be making the runoff altogether since there's a chance two Republicans could advance. It's theoretically possible the reverse could happen but overall Republicans have dominated in fundraising collectively taking in $1.7 million to just $915000 for Democrats. That disparity may reflect the traditionally conservative lean of the 6th District which covers much of the city of Arlington but juts out to take in rural areas south of Dallas. The area has always voted Republican though in 2020 Trump's 51-48 win was by far the closest result the district has produced in a presidential race in many years. Ron Wright however ran well ahead of the top of the ticket defeating Democrat Stephen Daniel 53-44. To have a chance at flipping this seat Democrats will need the district's overall trend to the left to continue though first of course they'll need to make sure one of their candidates gets to the runoff. Exactly when that second round might happen is unknown though because Texas law only permits runoffs to be scheduled after an initial election takes place. MD-Gov: Nonprofit head Wes Moore who said in February that he was considering seeking the Democratic nomination for governor has filed paperwork with state election officials to create a fundraising committee. Maryland Matters reports that Moore is likely to make an announcement "within the next few weeks." MT-02: Former Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke has filed paperwork with the FEC to create a campaign committee that would allow him to run in Montana's as-yet-undrawn—and entirely new—2nd Congressional District. (Yes that was weird to type. We're still writing "MT-AL" on our checks.) Zinke previously served as the state's lone member of the House after winning an open-seat race in 2014 but resigned not long after securing a second term to serve as Donald Trump's interior secretary. It was a promotion that worked out very poorly. Like many Trump officials Zinke was beset by corruption allegations including charges that he'd spent tens of thousands in taxpayer funds on personal travel and used public resources to advance a private land deal with the chair of the oil services company Halliburton. In all he was the subject of at least 15 investigations but what appears to have finally done him in was Democrats' victory in the 2018 midterms which would have exposed him to congressional subpoenas. The White House the Washington Post reported told Zinke "he had until the end of the year to leave or be fired." He resigned in mid-December. Zinke's old seat is now occupied by Republican Rep. Matt Rosendale who won his first term last year after Zinke's successor Greg Gianforte decided to run for governor. Fortunately for Zinke he and Rosendale are from opposite ends of the state: Rosendale lives in the small town of Glendive not far from the North Dakota border while Zinke's from Whitefish another small town located in Montana's northwestern corner. It's impossible to say of course when the next map will look like but these two burghs almost certainly won't wind up in the same district. We also don't know if Zinke will in fact seek a comeback since he hasn't yet spoken publicly about his intentions (and as we like to remind folks it's easy to file some forms with the FEC—it's a lot harder to actually run a campaign). But whether or not he does it's very likely that other ambitious Montana pols will also want to kick the tires on this brand-new district. KS-AG: We thought we were done with Kris Kobach but we thought wrong. The notorious voter suppression zealot and former Kansas secretary of state kicked off a campaign for state attorney general on Thursday following a failed bid for the Republican nomination for Senate in 2020 and a disastrous turn as the GOP's gubernatorial nominee two years earlier that handed the governorship to the Democrats. Team Blue would certainly love another shot at Kobach since his too-many-to-mention failings could once again put a statewide race in play. There's one we certainly have to note though since it directly impacts his qualifications to serve as Kansas' top law enforcement official: that time three years ago when a federal judge found Kobach in contempt for failing to comply with her orders in a suit that struck down a law he championed requiring new voters to provide proof of citizenship then made him take a remedial legal education class titled "Civil Trial: Everything You Need to Know." Of course Republicans would like to avoid one more go-round with Kobach as much as Democrats would enjoy one. The GOP successfully kept Kobach at bay in last year's Senate race (which Republican Roger Marshall went on to win) though so far he's the only notable candidate to announce a bid for the attorney general's post which is open because Republican incumbent Derek Schmidt is running for governor. The Kansas City Star says that state House Speaker Pro Tem Blaine Finch and state Sen. Kellie Warren could run for Republicans while no Democratic names have surfaced yet. With Kobach now in the mix that will likely change. NJ-Gov: Though New Jersey's primary is not until June former Assemblyman Jack Ciatarrelli is acting as though he already has the nomination in the bag judging by his TV ads attacking Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. His latest slams Murphy for ordering a shutdown of businesses at the start of the coronavirus pandemic—without actually mentioning the pandemic making it sound like Murphy just arbitrarily forced pizza places to close their doors. Perhaps this kind of messaging will work as the worst of the pandemic begins to fade but voters are apt to recall just how terrifying the virus' devastation was. One person trying to remind voters of precisely this is none other than … Jack Ciatarelli. In an ad he released last month he berated Murphy for nursing home deaths that happened on his watch saying that 8000 seniors and veterans died "scared and alone." FL-Gov FL-Sen: An unnamed source tells Politico that Democratic Rep. Val Demings is "more likely than not" to seek statewide office next year adding that "if she does it's almost definitely running for governor" against Republican Ron DeSantis rather than for Senate against Marco Rubio. NC-13: The conservative site Carolina Journal reports that some Republicans have already begun to express interest in running for North Carolina's 13th District just a day after GOP Rep. Ted Budd kicked off a bid for Senate. Former Davidson County Commissioner Zak Crotts who's also treasurer of the state Republican Party says he's "thinking about" the race though he cautioned that "we have to see what the district looks like" following redistricting. Meanwhile law student Bo Hines who's been challenging Rep. Virginia Foxx in the GOP primary in the 5th District (which doesn't currently neighbor the 13th) didn't rule out the possibility of switching races saying he's keeping "all options open." VA-Gov: Former Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy’s campaign has announced that it’s spending $450000 on a new TV buy in the Washington D.C. media market which is home to a little more than a third of the state’s residents ahead of the June 8 Democratic primary. Carroll Foy also has a new spot where she talks about how after her grandmother had a stroke “we were forced to choose between her mortgage and medicine.” She continues “So when my babies were born early I was grateful to have healthcare that saved their lives and mine.” Carroll Foy concludes “I’ve been a foster mom public defender and delegate who expanded Medicaid. Now I’m running for governor to bring affordable healthcare to all of us.”  Mayors: Three of Texas’ 10 largest cities Arlington Fort Worth and San Antonio are holding mayoral races on Saturday and we preview each of them below. All races are officially nonpartisan and all candidates compete on one ballot. In any contest where one candidate does not win a majority of the vote a runoff will be held at a later date that has yet to be determined. Arlington TX Mayor: Arlington home to Major League Baseball’s Texas Rangers and the iconic Dallas Cowboys football team is hosting an open-seat contest to replace termed-out Republican incumbent Jeff Williams. Business owner and former police officer Jim Ross has raised by far the most money of any candidate having spent $311000 so far and has the support of Williams and former Mayor Richard Greene. Other prominent candidates include City Councilman Marvin Sutton and former City Councilman Michael Glaspie. Sutton is backed by former Mayor Elzie Odom who was the first (and so far only) Black mayor in Arlington history.  Five other candidates are also on the ballot. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram notes that most of the contenders are people of color with one longtime observer local columnist O.K. Carter calling it the most diverse field he's ever seen in the city. One of the lesser-known candidates talent purchasing agent Jerry Warden was declared ineligible to run because of his status as a convicted sex offender. Due to Texas’ election laws however Warden will still appear on the ballot which could have an unpredictable impact as his name will be listed first.  Economic issues particularly those affecting small businesses have dominated this contest. Ross has spoken about the need to focus on Black businesses saying “When we have a 23% African American community and 1% of our businesses are owned by African Americans there’s a disparity there.” Sutton has also discussed equity issues and the need to address economic disparities while Glaspie has focused on helping Arlington businesses recover from the pandemic. Fort Worth TX Mayor: This is another open-seat contest to replace outgoing Republican Mayor Betsy Price who is retiring as the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history. Eleven candidates have lined up to succeed Price including her chief of staff Mattie Parker who has received the mayor's backing along with the support of the Fort Worth Police Officers Association. Parker also sports the biggest fundraising haul in the field with $1 million raised. Also on the GOP side is City Councilman Brian Byrd who is endorsed by Rep. Kay Granger. Byrd has raised $32400 for this race and injected an additional $310000 into his campaign via a personal loan. Fort Worth is one of the country’s largest cities with a Republican mayor but Democrats are making a strong push to change that this year. Tarrant County Democratic Party Chairwoman Deborah Peoples and City Councilwoman Ann Zadeh are Team Blue’s top contenders. Peoples has been endorsed by Dallas-area Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson Tarrant County Commissioner Roy Brooks and state Sen. Royce West. Additionally Rep. Marc Veasey whose district takes in part of Fort Worth reportedly will endorse one of these two progressives if either wins a spot in the runoff. Neither Peoples nor Zadeh have been as prolific fundraisers as their GOP counterparts with the candidates reporting hauls of $286000 and $128000 respectively. Diversity and equality has also emerged as a top issue in this campaign even among Republicans. Peoples has made focusing on the needs of people of color and improving relations between police and communities of color a central focus of her campaign. There have been multiple incidents of police violence targeting Black residents of Fort Worth in recent years and even Price acknowledged this issue was among the most challenging to deal with during her time in office.  Byrd has also spoken on racial issues kicking off his campaign in a historically Black neighborhood in the city. However Byrd who is white has sent out mailers with racial overtones that emphasized his support for police and commitment to “public safety” while another specifically targeted Peoples who is Black. San Antonio TX Mayor: Incumbent Ron Nirenberg is seeking a second term as mayor of Texas’ second-largest city and faces a rematch against a familiar foe. Nirenberg a progressive independent won a 51-49 contest over conservative Greg Brockhouse in 2019. Brockhouse is back again and the pair are the top contenders in a wide field of 15 candidates. Nirenberg who has been endorsed by former Mayor Julián Castro has a wide advantage in fundraising over Brockhouse beating him $218000 to $14000 in the last fundraising period. Additionally local pollster Bexar Facts polling on behalf of KSAT and San Antonio Report released a survey earlier this month that showed Nirenberg leading Brockhouse 56-21. Nirenberg’s underlying numbers appeared strong in this poll as well as he boasted a 67% approval rating.  Observers have noted this race has been a departure from the intense tone of 2019’s contest though issues surrounding police and firefighters unions have remained contentious. Brockhouse a former consultant for both the city's police and firefighter unions received strong support in his last bid from both labor groups which deployed a combined $530000 on Brockhouse' behalf—more than twice what the candidate himself spent. This time around though the two unions have stayed neutral as Nirenberg has successfully managed to navigate thorny issues with them. Nirenberg and the city negotiated a new deal with the firefighters union while also sidestepping questions about Proposition B a measure that would repeal the right of the police union to engage in collective bargaining. Nirenberg has not taken a stance on the proposition and claims his focus is on the current round of negotiations with the union.
