L, SCOTUS decision gives Kansas GOP and Kris Kobach the green light for even more voter suppression, Christopher Reeves, 2021-07-07, When Kansas Republican legislators overturned a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to install HB 2183 they did so with one big reason: to shut down voting rights in Kansas. July 1 2021 is the 50th anniversary of the passage of the 26th amendment and the extension of voting rights to 18-year-olds; On that very anniversary voting rights organizations like the League of Women Voters officially shut down voter registration drives in the state of Kansas for fear of arrest and prosecution. From Kansas Reflector: Jacqueline Lightcap co-president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas says she has asked the organization’s nine local leaders to temporarily suspend their voter education and registration efforts. “It’s very disheartening” Lightcap said. “We’re not happy about it. We’re not pleased. We don’t want to do it. But at the same time it needs to be known that this is not a good law.” Davis Hammet organizer for Loud Light another voter registration service expands on this through his Twitter feed: BREAKING: Loud Light Suspends Voter Registration Due to New Voter Suppression Law #ksleg 1/7 pic.twitter.com/eHQiLMIWzX How bad can the penalty really be for making sure people have the right to vote? As the Kansas Reflector continues it can be quite draconian:   House Bill 2183 adds new restrictions and penalties for touching somebody else’s ballot distributing ballots helping someone turn in their ballot or altering the postmark on an advanced ballot. Under the law false representation of an election official is a felony crime with a punishment of up to 17 months in prison and a $100000 fine. The problem is amplified by the 6-3 ruling of the Supreme Court backing state legislators in the creation of such laws and giving the green light for enacting these procedures nationally. Lauren Floyd wrote thoughtfully about the problems in Kansas but what is often missing is the way in which Republicans have used the state legislature local and state elections to do anything possible to slow down the rights of those to vote and to scare away those who do desire to be heard. It took years before then secretary of state Kris Kobach’s Crosscheck would be dismantled. The program was designed to find ways to remove voter rights by seeing if they could possibly be registered elsewhere in the country a system that was rife with errors and had no real success. In 2016 Kobach was caught right here on Daily Kos putting out bad information into the Latinx community regarding voter registration. After Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and post the 2020 election Republicans have continued to constrict the rights of those to vote. Now Kobach is back campaigning for a new office—state attorney general—and he’s already campaigning on exactly where he wants to go. Speaking to Sunflower State Journal:  A spokesman for Kobach immediately trashed Warren’s background in property law. “If there is a less relevant legal background for the Attorney General’s office than real estate law I don’t know what it is” spokesman Casey Burns said. “Kansas doesn’t need a homeowner association lawyer in the attorney general’s office they need a fighter who will go to battle against the illegal and unconstitutional executive orders of the Biden administration” he said. “Kris Kobach has the experience and qualifications to defend our Second Amendment rights and secure our elections with voter ID at the polls.” Voter suppression: why bother trying to hide it when you just decide to campaign on that very issue.
