L, IAN: Tuesday May 11 2021: What's New at Rancho EJ?, ejoannaforItzl Alert Network, 2021-05-10, Tuesday:  A day to: take stock.      Monday: Crimson Quillfeather Tuesday: ejoanna Wednesday: Pam from Calif Thursday: art ah zen Friday: FloridaSNMOM Saturday: FloridaSNDad Sunday: loggersbrat Lately when people ask: “What’s new?”-- I answer:  “No† much.”  Of course vaccination status comes up. But other than that (and grousing about our Drought) my go-†o answer is. . . “boring.”  But as I share wi†h whoever doesn't move away fast enough “Boring is the new good!” What?  “Boring” is good?? Yep you heard me right. In the last year+ of Covid (and the 4 years of u-no-who as “president”) “new” so often meant something bad. Scary. Dangerous. Evil. Not always but too often.  For example some of my friends are complaining that president Joe Biden is “boring.” I don’t disagree; but I do define “boring” differently though. Hours even days go by and Biden is not jackhammering in my worry-brain.  I kinda forget about him.  But it’s a good forgetting.  I know that he’s busy working for us for the good.  And as much as I can trust even a decent President I trust him and the people he’s put around him to act in the public interest. And that is SUCH a relief after the horror of the Last Guy. So I enjoy the progress in my garden. And carefully venture out as Life outside the Rancho opens up. Still wearing a mask—and maintaining social distancing.  And optimistic enough to be planting seeds and seedlings for late summer flowers herbs and veggies. How about you? What’s new? And remember: boring is just fine.
