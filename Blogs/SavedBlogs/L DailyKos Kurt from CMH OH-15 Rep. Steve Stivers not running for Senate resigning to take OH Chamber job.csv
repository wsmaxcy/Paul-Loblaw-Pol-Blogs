L, OH-15: Rep. Steve Stivers not running for Senate resigning to take OH Chamber job, Kurt from CMH, 2021-04-19, From the Columbus Dispatch:  U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers won't run for U.S. Senate instead taking a position to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. Stivers 55 of Upper Arlington announced Monday that he would step down from politics where he represents the 15th District on May 16 to become the next president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. This is an interesting turn of events considering that Stivers had been considered a possible candidate in the race to succeed Sen. Rob Portman.  Stivers will take the helm of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce a business group with considerable lobbying activity at the state level.  This is similar to the path another former central Ohio congressman Pat Tiberi took in 2017 when he resigned the 12th District seat to run the Ohio Business Roundtable. What is Stivers signaling here?  That he doesn’t think he could win the GOP nomination for Senate?  That possibly the political environment is such that the ‘publicans won’t win the House back any time soon making the House less attractive for Stivers?  I think those factors definitely figure into his decision.  In taking the position with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce Stivers remains connected to politics and could run again at some point in the future. A special election will need to be held to elect a successor to Stivers.  The date of the election including primaries will be set after Stivers actually leaves office on May 16.  My neighborhood was in the 15th House District until 2012 when it was re-districted to the 12th so Stivers was my congressman for two years.  I campaigned for his opponent former Rep. Mary Jo Kilroy until Stivers defeated her in the 2010 election.
