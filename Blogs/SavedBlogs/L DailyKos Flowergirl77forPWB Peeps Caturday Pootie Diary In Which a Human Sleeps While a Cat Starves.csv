L, Caturday Pootie Diary: In Which a Human Sleeps While a Cat Starves, Flowergirl77forPWB Peeps, 2021-05-01, “Are you in there?” Freddie asked touching his nose to mine. “It’s too early” I groaned pulling the blankets up to my chin and snuggling down. “Go back to sleep.” “Okay” he said. I felt him walk away from me on the bed and then heard the thump as he jumped to the ground. I sighed sleepily and slipped back under. What felt like 10 seconds later but was probably more like 10 minutes I woke up knocked awake by his body hitting my bed again. His nose touched mine. “What?” I muttered. “I’m pretty hungry” he told me. You know how this works but as always a gentle reminder:  Pooties are cats; Woozles are dogs.  Goggies are dogs too and moggies are cats. Birds...are birds!  Peeps are people.  PWB Peeps are Pooties Woozle Birds People.  No trolling the diary. I opened my eyes and looked at his little hopeful face. I turned my head to look at the clock. “thirty five more minutes” I said then rolled onto my side giving him my back. “Okay” he said then repeated his path to the end of the bed and then the floor.   I was almost asleep again when I felt his paws on my hip. I cracked my eyes open and saw him leaning over my body to look at my face. “It’s not breakfast time” I told him. “Are you sure?” he asked. “Because I sure am hungry.” “You have kibble” I reminded him closing my eyes. “Okay” he said and left again.   I came out of my doze again this time to the sound of loud purring near my ear. “I know what you’re doing” I said eyes tightly closed. “I don’t care how close in register it is to a crying baby I’m not getting up before the alarm goes off.” The purr just got louder. I laughed a little then rolled over so I could pet him. “I don’t want to get up yet” I confessed. “Hungry” was all he said. Behind me the sound of flute music and chirping birds started quiet at first but getting louder every second. “That’s the alarm” Freddie announced and sprinted off my bed. I hit the snooze and closed my eyes again.   “Hey!” he said smelling my face. “The alarm went off.” “I hit the snooze” I admitted opening my eyes to look at him. “Get up!” he demanded and left again pausing at the doorway to give the carpet an energetic clawing. “Knock it off!” I called. “Get up!” he said again. With a sigh I finally obeyed.   He waited for me at the top of the stairs and watched as I stepped past him. I got about 3 steps down when he suddenly shot past me. I startled despite having this experience sometimes several times a day and grabbed the rail to keep from taking a tumble. “Be careful!” I admonished thinking about Annie Wilkes.  “Let’s eat!” he called out behind him. I was now 4 steps down and he was already on the ground floor. As soon as my right foot hit the floor Freddie came running out of the kitchen and halfway toward me. He stopped and stared at me then turned and ran back into the kitchen. “I’m coming” I said laughing.   I made my way into the kitchen glancing at his kibble bowl. It wasn’t full but it wasn’t empty either. “You had kibble” I said mildly exasperated. “That’s not real food” he said staring pointedly at the pantry where his food was stored. I chuckled and hit the button on the coffee maker to heat the water. I opened the cupboard and pulled out a coffee mug as well as one of the plates we use to serve his “real” food to him. The sound of both pieces of pottery hitting the counter brought him from the pantry door to my legs. He rubbed aggressively and I did my best to remain standing. “Freddie!” I said. “Give me a minute.” “Foooooooood!” he sang trying again to give me a dead leg. I spooned my sugar and creamer into my mug and set it on the coffee maker to start brewing. Carefully not wanting to step on him I turned to grab a packet of wet food. He ran ahead of me to the pantry door. “It’s in here!” he declared knocking his head into it.   “Take it easy on that head” I admonished. “I like that head.” I carefully opened the pantry door and grabbed a packet at random then turned back to the counter. He danced after me still singing about his stomach. “Give me a second” I said again pulling a fork out of the drawer. Here’s the thing about the packets: Freddie really really likes the food that come this way. But it is not as easy to open and empty them as it is with the cans. It takes a little longer to scrape all the chunks of fish and chicken from the corners and I take my time to do it right. The food isn’t cheap and I’m not about to throw any of it away. Freddie is not sanguine about this process. “Feeeeeeeeeeed meeeeeeeeeeee!” he howled as I carefully worked the fork into the corner of the packet. “I’m sooooooooo huuuuuuungry what is taking so looooooooooooooooong!” “I’m working on it” I told him absently. There was a bit stuck where the packet folds into itself on the bottom and it did not want to come out. “I know you want all of it.” His head hit the back of my knee hard and I almost went down. “Freddie!” I said. “It’s coming! Calm down!”   “Why do you want me to staaaaaaaaaarve!” he demanded nearly frantic about how close he was to eating. “You’re being dramatic” I said then let out a victorious little cheer as the chunk of tuna? Chicken? Finally came free. I dropped the now empty packet on the counter and set the fork on top. I picked up the plate and carefully walked to his food mat watching as he danced impatiently around me crying in frustration and impatience. We made our way together to the mat me watching him so I didn’t trip and him watching the plate in my hand. I set the plate on the mat and reached over to give his fur a long stroke as he moved past me to fall on the food. The sounds of slobbering and slurping started and I gave a little grimace of disgust. He was never a quiet or delicate eater. I disposed of the empty packet and set the fork in the sink washed my hands then picked up my now full coffee cup and went to the couch to sit and drink it. Not too long later he joined me on the couch and settled himself next to me to start his long grooming process. “Good breakfast?” I asked. He ignored me to wash his face. “You’re welcome” I added sipping my hot coffee. Happy Caturday Peeps! I feel like if Freddie really could speak English he’d spend all his time chatting about food.
