L, What Kills democracy:  Our Failure to Choose Justice for ALL!, The Reasonable Voice, 2021-05-10, How we perceive the global COVID-19/SARS-2 pandemic and its if you can’t beat them join them political Hail Mary marketing reversal Operation Warp Speed for mis-administrating shots of vaccines and its fast-forwarded race against presidential arrogance media manipulation – indeed time itself – exposes beyond imbedded historical fears to our broader centuries old slight-of-hand grasp of self-truth. History most easily repeats itself most efficiently the very moment we the easily impressionable people fail to follow the line of succession from LBJ’s Gulf of Tonkin lie and Nixon’s Watergate break-in impeachable offenses - through fantastical overdoses of Trickle Down Welfare Queen Government is the Problem misleading campaign slogans to McConnell’s Bork revenge against Democrats particularly all Obama and Biden presidential public policies to reconnect Americans to United We Stand. However the intentional discordant bridge from Nixon to 6 January 2021 didn’t culminate with sore loser Moscow Mitch nor the wildly yet tiny swinging pendulum of Lindsay Graham or the foxy anti we hold these truths to be self-evident tag team of Carlson & Hannity continually enabling clones like Nunez and Marjorie Taylor Greene to spawn the infection of America’s infamous tragedy:  Americans replaying near suicidal short-sightedness - killing our own young with our blind faith in the profiteering chicanery of corporate sponsored war mongers. We really had to be exceptionally mesmerized by the Mushroom Cloud Con of Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz to accept forever oil wars in which the Watson Institute reports between 480000 and 507000 people have been killed in the United States’ post-9/11 wars in Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan – before all we like sheep could willingly prostrate ourselves as welcome mats to the Big Lie of our 45th. The destruction of our democracy needed every shouting attendee at Trump rallies from Tuesday 19 January 2016 to every 2021 attacker on our nation’s Capitol Building and all Democrats Republicans and Independents therein. While by far the tightest grip on the champion of death tolls’ trophy belongs to global pandemics standing astride the bodies of so many who could have been spared but for the lack of competent and caring leadership - coming in second for the selfish negligence award are those whose chosen Mission is to convince Americans that patriotism best honors American values by being manipulated duped and ultimately sacrificed by one’s elected leaders. We need now internalize forever:  such a definition of patriotism is a false positive perpetuated by those who’s sons and daughters are rarely sent into harm’s way. So when evaluating communications and communicators election choices or revising our opinions about Conservatism or those who’ve most recently gone sour on The Big Lie Conservative Republicans in Congress and many State Legislatures have decided to vote the end justifies the means divine obedience to regain and maintain political power at the expense of Americans and our electoral process. It’s time we reevaluate reconsider and remember: Not all presidents fit the mold of Washington FDR or John Kennedy Currently the legacy of Conservative Republicanism reflects more Jim Jordan and Ron Johnson than Senator Eric Dirksen There are more Thurgood Marshalls & RBG’s on the Supreme bench of democracy than there are Thomas and Kavanaugh Duos. Too many unknown Americans suffer go hungry even die every day to maintain the cash flow for elected officials long on promissory notes with little intention of delivering on anything save using our taxes to fuel their rise up the ladder of self-aggrandizement. The International Criminal Court still considers senior members of the Bush/Cheney Administration War Criminals:  there were no Weapons of Mass Destruction; no threatening Axis of Evil until world stage elevated by Bush/Cheney and Trump/Pence Remembering American WWII Internment Camps for Japanese Americans or Nazi like Tuskegee syphilis testing on American citizens of color can understandably harbor a lack of trust for the old white fathers maintain a chokehold on power. Currently the legacy of Edward R. Murrow Walter Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkly has been tarnished by conjecture shamed by hyperbolic distractions and mocked by poor attempts at variety show entertainment minus the variety with too much news sacrificed to fleeting TV soundbites between too much corporate marketing. When thinking perhaps we won’t be blinded by the manufactured patriotism yielding profit for those who choose to send us in harm’s way in a Vietnam or Iraq. Before we form political opinions that impact on our daily lives consider this  just because a Congressional Trump supporter opposes The Big Lie Trump employs to gouge the gullible doesn’t excuse their Conservative agenda of  anti-America anti-people of color and anti-women voting record. Maybe if we think of the global Coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-2 as a rehearsal for what our children and grandchildren will face the more we deny the effects of Climate Change – we might make better political life choices.
