L, The Josh Duggar Chronicles: From Realty TV Star to Arrested for Possession of Child Pornography, Bill Berkowitz, 2021-05-01, Josh Duggar is back in the headlines. And that’s not a good thing! In case you don’t remember Josh is the oldest son of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and was one of the stars of his parents’ television reality show 19 Kids and Counting which was a smash hit that made the Duggars a household name.  On Thursday April 29 Homeland Security took Duggar into custody leveling two charges against him: one count of receipt of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography.   Josh pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday while appearing in court virtually via Zoom. The reality star's attorneys opted to forgo having the judge read out the charges he's facing. If Josh is granted bail U.S Chief Magistrate Judge Erin L. Wiedemann ordered that he will have to be "in a residence where there's no minor in the home."  After Duggar was arrested Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar issued a statement that read: "We appreciate your continued prayers for our family at this time. The accusations brought against Joshua today are very serious.  "It is our prayer that the truth no matter what it is will come to light and that this will all be resolved in a timely manner. We love Josh and Anna and continue to pray for their family" the statement continued.  Josh Duggar is no stranger to scandal. And the family itself are longtime anti-gay and anti-trans activists. According to Nico Lang’s report for rewirenewsgroup “Like many in the Quiverfull movement the Duggar family regards LGBTQ people as committing a ‘sin.’ Members of its ever-expanding clan have referred to homosexuality as a ‘worldview that rejects God’s truth’ ‘degrading to children’ and a ‘travesty.’ Derick Dillard husband of second-oldest daughter Jill Duggar Dillard has referred to trans identity as a ‘myth’ and compared gender-affirming surgeries to ‘genital mutilation.’”  Several years ago after Duggar’s name showed up as one of the 37 million cheating spouses to allegedly have Ashley Madison accounts he issued the following statement: “I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife. I am so ashamed of the double life that I have been living and am grieved for the hurt pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family and most of all Jesus and all those who profess faith in Him.”  Judging from the recent arrest indictment  apparently Duggar was leading more than a “double life”!   Anyone following the incessant moralizing by notable Christian Right leaders recognizes that a variation of Duggar’s statement could have come from the likes of Jimmy Swaggart Jim Bakker Ted Haggard or a number of other conservative evangelical Christians who made their fortunes and exalted reputations by espousing so-called traditional family values and vigorously condemning those who didn’t.  In August 2015 I wrote about Josh Duggar’s serial transgressions:  According Gawker’s Ashley Fleming Duggar who played a prominent role in his family’s reality television program 19 Kids and Counting and whose parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar covered up his teenage sexual molestation of five young girls including four of his younger sisters apparently “maintained a paid account on Ashley Madison a web site created for the express purpose of cheating on your spouse” while working for the powerful and well-funded Washington D.C.-based “traditional family values” lobbying outfit headed by Tony Perkins.  After information came out about Josh Duggar’s past he posted what was supposed to be an expression of deep regret and reassurance to his fans saying that the sexual molestation issue had been dealt with and that he was now on the right path: “We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life. I sought forgiveness from those I had wronged and asked Christ to forgive me and come into my life. I would do anything to go back to those teen years and take different actions. In my life today I am so very thankful for God’s grace mercy and redemption.”  Now a few months later according to Gawker’s Ashley Fleming “Someone using a credit card belonging to a Joshua J. Duggar with a billing address that matches the home in Fayetteville Arkansas owned by his grandmother Mary — a home that was consistently shown on their now-cancelled TV show and in which Anna Duggar gave birth to her first child — paid a total of $986.76 for two different monthly Ashley Madison subscriptions from February of 2013 until May of 2015.” Fleming pointed out that “In July 2014 he seems to have started a second account that was linked to his home in Oxon Hill Maryland where he spent his time lobbying against causes like same-sex marriage. The birthday listed in the data for Duggar’s first account is February 3 1988 one month off Duggar’s actual birthday of March 3 1988. The birthday listed for the second account is March 2 1988. “The two accounts overlap by a period of a few months. When he launched the second account Duggar paid an initial fee of $250 that appears to have gone toward the purchase of an ‘affair guarantee’: ‘Customers who buy 1000 credits for $250 receive a money-back “affair guarantee” if they don’t have an affair within three months.  Earlier this year in a story dated June 15 and headlined “The Truth About Josh Duggar’s Sham Cult-Center ‘Counseling’” Fleming reported that the training center that the Duggar family repeatedly talked about in interviews after the revelations about Josh surfaced “was actually the Institute for Basic Life Principles (IBLP) Little Rock Training Center one of many scattered throughout the country that were once run by the single 80-year-old cult leader Bill Gothard who was forced to formally step down in 2014 in response to a few inconvenient (specifically 34) charges of sexual abuse.”  Apparently whatever training Josh received – other than the forced construction work his father talked about – is unclear. Fleming noted that “it’s highly likely that Josh Duggar was subjected to IBLP’s special brand of warped fundamentalist therapy” from people who “aren’t trained therapists at least not in any widely accepted sense.”  Fleming maintained that “As we’ve seen with their material on counseling victims of sexual abuse the program is full of the sort of dangerous backwards logic that places blame in all the wrong places. In other words it not only has the potential to be highly damaging to those already hurt but it does little to actually correct the root of the problem in any meaningful way.”  The Duggar Family quick to vigorously condemn those they don’t agree with has been silent thus far on their son’s latest controversy.  Last August Michelle Duggar campaigned against an anti-discrimination bill in Fayetteville Arkansas saying: "I don't believe... citizens... would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls."  Duggar poured it on: "I doubt that Fayetteville parents would stand for a law that would endanger their daughters or allow them to be traumatized by a man joining them in their private space. We should never place the preference of an adult over the safety and innocence of a child. Parents who do you want undressing next to your daughter at the public swimming pool's private changing area? I still believe that we are a society that puts women and children first.”  Although Duggar did not admit to using the Ashley Madison connection he ended his statement by saying: “I brought hurt and a reproach to my family close friends and the fans of our show with my actions that happened when I was 14-15 years old and now I have re-broken their trust.”  Josh Duggar and his wife Anna were married in 2008 and have six children together: Mackynzie 11 Michael 9 Marcus 7 Meredith 5 Mason 3 and Maryella 17 months and Anna is expecting another child.  According to multiple news reports prosecutors want Duggar to hand over all computers and cell phones containing the material if he is found guilty. Prosecutors asked that "upon conviction of any count" Duggar be ordered to "forfeit" to the United States all of the illegal photos or videos any profits made from sharing the child porn and "any property real or person including any and all computer equipment used or intended to be used to commit or to promote the commission of the offenses in the Indictment" Radar reported.  If convicted Duggar faces $250000 fines on each count as well as up to 20 years behind bars.
