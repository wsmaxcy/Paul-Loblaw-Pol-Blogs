L, NC-Sen: Jeff Jackson (D) Keeps Up The Pressure On Congress To Take Action On Ending Gerrymandering, poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-29, Received this e-mail today from State Senator Jeff Jackson’s (D. NC) U.S. Senate campaign: I want to take a moment to talk about something more important than fundraising. We need to end gerrymandering — and we’re running out of time. In just a few months politicians across the country are going to draw their own election maps and pick their own voters – for the next decade. Watch our video here >> According to elections experts Republicans could win back the U.S. House next year because of redistricting alone. That’s because if you control the map you can control the outcome. You can pick the winners before the race is even held. That’s not how it should work. That’s why we’re calling for an end to gerrymandering. We hope you’ll join us by signing on to endorse our plan: So how do we stop this? The good news is that Congress can take action right now. They can require that every state implement an independent redistricting commission – one with an even number of Democrats Republicans and Independents who have to agree on how the maps are drawn. But they’ve stalled. And we need to send a clear message: Get moving. If you agree we can’t wait another decade to end partisan gerrymandering please sign on to support our plan: Remember: This is the last best chance we have to end gerrymandering this decade. Thanks for joining our effort. — Jeff Click here to add your name. FYI in case you were wondering: This is an incredibly reckless position from Sen. Manchin given that Sen. McConnell believes he has no political incentive to work with Dems on major legislation.I guess you can send him a bunch of emails if you want... or you can just elect me and we’re good here. https://t.co/fTVAzWymWX  Sen. Manchin isn’t moving us toward compromise. He’s moving us toward gridlock and voters are fed up with that. We have to be able to deliver on things that matter to people. We can’t just give up here at the start.
