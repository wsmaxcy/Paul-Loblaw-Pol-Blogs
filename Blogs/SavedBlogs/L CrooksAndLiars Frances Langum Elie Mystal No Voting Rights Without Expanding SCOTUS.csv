L, Elie Mystal: No Voting Rights Without Expanding SCOTUS, Frances Langum, 2021-05-12, Elie Mystal doesn't sugarcoat it.  If Democrats don't do something and fast to unpack the Mitch McConnell-packed Supreme Court voting rights bills are for naught. Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans stole two Supreme Court seats one from Barack Obama when they invented a bogus rule to prevent the nomination of Merrick Garland and then one from the voters when they broke the bogus rule they invented and put Amy Coney Barrett on the bench with lightning speed before Mango Mussolini's so-called "presidency" was lost. They're thieves they stole the high Court and it's time to UNPACK the court and take it back by expanding the size of SCOTUS.   The work being done in Congress to protect voting rights is for naught because the Roberts court can just overturn it.  “If we are not aggressively reforming the court then we are doing nothing to protect voting rights because John Roberts and now six conservatives can destroy whatever Congress passes” said Mystal.   The problem with everything happening in Congress today everything happening in the Senate the John Lewis Act is that John Roberts is still there. Mystal went on:   "I cannot count 5 votes on this Supreme Court to uphold anything Congress could pass to restore #VotingRights." --@ElieNYC on #inners #ExpandTheCourt — Bruce Mirken (@BruceMirken) May 12 2021 The Constitution is a nightmare most Black people have been trying to wake up from since 1865. But most white people are still committed to reasoning with Freddy Krueger. — Elie Mystal (@ElieNYC) May 11 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
