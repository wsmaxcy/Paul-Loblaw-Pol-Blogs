C, The Left Are Deluded Drunk Drivers, davenj1, 2020-12-27, As the title suggests they are not actually “drunk drivers” but they act like one type of drunk driver.  So by way of metaphor imagine you go out one night and meet some friends at a bar.  Your intentions are to only have a couple drinks but those two turn into more and you find yourself drunk.  You get in your car and drive home but accidentally hit a fence along the way damaging the car.  You awaken the next day look at the car and decide that driving inebriated is not such a great idea.  You have learned your expensive lesson and never drive drunk again. Compare that scenario to the other friend who leaves as inebriated as you and makes it home safely- no stops by the police and no auto damage or dead animal on the way home.  They resolve in their heads that they can drive drunk so the next time they are out they get a little more drunke and still make it home safe and sound.  Each successive time out among friends at a bar they up the ante until the odds eventually catch up to them. The Left is like the latter scenario.  It is a slow progression of making it through just enough to convince themselves they can have just a few more the next time around.  The Left is in a permanent state of revolution each time pushing the envelope a little further with little pushback from the adults in the room.  There has to be a bartender that says “Enough is enough pal.”  There was no such bartender until November 2016 when Trump stepped behind the bar. They made it through the first “crisis-” the rancor of the 1960s- and were greeted with appeasement from the Right.  They got everything they wanted more or less.  That included abortion affirmative action and virtually open borders.  Instead of holding the line the Right bought a few years of peace.  We achieved a short-term benefit without realizing the consequences to subsequent generations. However like the drunk driver who thinks he is invincible because he makes it home each time the Left is never satisfied since they are fanatical in their desires.  Their wants desires and demands increase in lunacy to the point they blur the lines between the definitions of the sexes.  They push harder and harder to the point where being white is considered evil (they use the word “privileged”) that there should be no such thing as national borders that Christianity and doctrine is “so 1600’s” and that anyone who speaks out against them should be censored (they call it “fact-checking”).  They are emboldened because any effective resistance was minimal at best and because they captured the very institutions that could have been a check on their desires- academia and the media. When one thinks about it this country has been through many a crisis and survived and on the other side actually thrived.  Sometimes it was by the skin of our teeth.  If not for a grievous mistake at Gettysburg who knows what could have been?  But since the 1960s there has been a slow build up of grievances.  There have been well-meaning attempts at reconciliation a compromise here or there that slapped a bandaid on the problem some misjudgments and a perception that “this crisis” will soon blow over and we will all be alright. But something happened in 2020 that makes me think there may be no surviving the most recent crises.  Lockdowns in the face of a pandemic the violence we saw on the streets of our cities at the hand of BLM/antifa and the ultimate kick in the crotch- a fraudulent election may have drained any good will that minimally existed pre-2020.  Today we hear unthinkable words more at home in the mid-1800s- “nullification” “secession” and “revolution.”  There is one thing that can potentially bring the balkanized American electorate together and it is a tool readily available to the elites soon to be in power- a foreign war but it would likely in the long term makes things only worse. How close are we to this state of affairs and what is the next step?  Is there to be civil war not in the sense of that which happened in 1860 but a civil war of the American mind nevertheless or is there to be tyranny at the hands of the centralized federal government?  Will an American Caesar emerge at some point in the near future?  How far will Biden and/or Harris push the Democrat’s socialist agenda? One thing we know for sure the Right’s appeasement of the Left in the aftermath of the turbulent 1960s may have bought the Nation about a few decades worth of relative peace but at a great price.  The 1970s was a period of cooling off (although it bought us four years of Jimmy Carter) and despite the sanctification of Reagan the 1980s was a furtherance of that cooling off period.  The year 2020 will not bring about a cooling off period nor should it. To do otherwise would allow the drunk drivers of politics- the socialist Left and their Democrat Party patsies- to redefine in their demented image what this country is and represents.  Only total committed opposition to that vision is what will save this country from either total balkanization or government tyranny.  True revolutions uprisings or civil wars rarely occur over a single governmental provocation and instead build up over time.  It took about 16 years from the first acts of the British Parliament to the first shots at Lexington and Concord.  It took longer from the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to the Civil War. Biden’s talk of “healing” is simply hollow words from a hollow man.  The lengths to which the Left went to demonize Trump and then install Biden as their puppet has left a chasm of ill-will in its wake.  The fanatical drunk driver will never learn his lesson until he fatally crashes his car into a tree.  We conservatives are that tree and we must remain standing.
