L, Announcing "Around the World in 80 Seconds" an International News Video Short, Toro Blanco, 2021-05-08, Hello DailyKos!  I’ve been working a new regular feature for my website for some time and today is the inaugural launch of my new video series Around the World in 80 Seconds.  The videos will be short overviews of breaking news headlines from around the world.  Currently it will be a once a week feature but if I get enough donations via my Patreon page (www.patreon.com/…) I’ll be able to make it more frequently.  Enjoy the inaugural episode below!  This video was also posted to me website Toro Blanco Media.  If you liked this article please donate via my Patreon page.  Every little bit helps and enables me to put more time and effort into my work here.  Remember more donations means more writing and more videos!
