L, previous guy's "ignoration day" came after Chris Steele produced a "second" dossier for the FBI, annieliforTrump Russia Investigators, 2021-05-04, Expect some GOP  to be triggered by this new information about intelligence produced during Trump’s term as “...it was used by the US Justice Department to support a secret court order authorising surveillance of Carter Page” "The former MI6 spy Christopher Steele produced a second dossier for the FBI on Donald Trump while he was in the White House sources told The Telegraph. Mr Steele filed a series of intelligence reports to US authorities during the Trump presidency including information concerning alleged sexual exploits" the British newspaper reported Monday evening. "Mr Steele's continued involvement supplying intelligence to the FBI appears to give credibility to his original dossier which sparked a Special Counsel investigation by prosecutor Robert Mueller into Russian interference into the 2016 US presidential elections" the newspaper noted. "The second dossier contains raw intelligence that makes further claims of Russian meddling in the US election and also references claims regarding the existence of further sex tapes. The second dossier is reliant on separate sources to those who supplied information for the first reports." www.rawstory.com/…  The fact the FBI continued to receive intelligence from Steele who ran MI6’s Russia desk from 2006 to 2009 before setting up Orbis is potentially significant because it shows his work was apparently still being taken seriously after Trump took hold of the reins of power. The Mueller inquiry led to a series of convictions including the jailing of Paul Manafort Trump’s campaign chairman. Others convicted included George Papadopoulos an adviser to the Trump campaign; and Roger Stone a long time ally and former adviser. Intelligence gathered by Steele for his second dossier is understood to include further details of Manafort’s alleged Russian contacts. Earlier this month news sources in the US reported that Konstantin Kilimnik an associate of Manafort had passed Trump campaign polling and strategy information to Russian intelligence sources. www.smh.com.au/... NEW: DOJ just turned over to @BuzzFeedNews and I and CNN nearly 300 pages of the supplemental material attached to the FBI 302s from the Mueller probe. @a_cormier_ and I are going through the records now but here's a sample pic.twitter.com/K1JkYvLN45   Lin Wood's followers think it's silly to point out his typos. But doesn't it undermine your Supreme Court brief when you say "Ignoration Day"? pic.twitter.com/MoIX3TBQeD  Trump’s lawlessness as enabled & protected by Bill Barr inspired a criminal recklessness in those orbiting around Trump. The good news? Criminal recklessness always produces lots of valuable evidence. #JusticeIsComing for the Trump criminal cabal. And #JusticeMatters https://t.co/pN8dcXKDPQ
