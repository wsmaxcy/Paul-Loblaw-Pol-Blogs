L, Senators Manchin and Sinema listen up, JoeTheVoter, 2021-07-06, I hear their arguments in favor of allowing the GOP to destroy democracy in the name of “bipartisanship”. There is zero bipartisanship involved in the destruction process...why should these two “democrats” hold out for that in the fight to save democracy? Both senators seem to think they can stuff their pockets with raw meat then proceed to negotiate with a hungry bear. The bear will win every time. Pacification is not a solution to hold a tyrant at bay. The threat is real and growing and if it is not put to rest NOW the end of our democracy and freedoms can be the end result of their inaction.  Is that what they want as their legacy? “Sorry world we broke democracy” If For the People act is not enacted before the next midterm Democrats could lose congress due to rigged elections. That is the end of voting rights. With a GOP congress don’t ever think they will pursue a bipartisan anything let alone protections for our 15th Amendment right to vote. They DO NOT WANT YOU TO VOTE ! Another scary potential is that in the next election the GOP controlled states will just REFUSE to certify any election they don’t like. Then what?  READ THIS.( I sent via fax to Manchin and Sinema using FaxZero.com ) -- Joe the Voter
