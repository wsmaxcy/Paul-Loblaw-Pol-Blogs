L, flipping on previous guy remains one of many provocative questions for Weisselberg, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-07-01, “Although many legal scholars believe that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime a former president clearly can be.”  Like previous guy’s demand to ‘unmask’ the identity of the shooter of Ashli Babbit the logic of the 15 count indictment of Weisselberg and the Trump Organization is less about justice than a bit of media analysis. Darn nuance and lawfare plus time served the plea bargaining continues because there’s still so much more of Trump’s company to reveal.  I’m not optimistic that Weisselberg will flip but I am optimistic he’ll be convicted. The law is fairly clear on what is income & what is taxable. He’s a sophisticated executive; mistake is implausible. The company booked much of it as income. And juries hate rich tax cheats.  The Trump Corporation reportedly tracked Allen Weisselberg’s unreported fringe benefits to make sure he wasn’t paid too much—Trump’s miserliness may finally catch up with him. https://t.co/tbkibZMphG Trump to NYT today re Allen Weisselberg “I’m with him all the way. Trump said this bc the opposite is true. The translation of that line is “I didn’t do it Allen did it.” It’s an alert for Weisselberg to run fast to cooperate. It’s a sure sign Trump will blame him for everything  Michael Cohen who said he’d take a bullet for Trump ultimately cooperated as his legal bills mounted. Weisselberg faces similar bills & back taxes. He’s refused to cooperate so far impossible to know if he will but with trial months off prosecutors can play a long game.     THREAD: What should we make of today's indictment of the Trump Organization and its CFO Allen Weisselberg?   NY’s hottest club is the state Supreme Court arraignment of Allen Weisselberg and the Trump Organization pic.twitter.com/C1wODreUCs As many have surmised for some time now CFO Fred Weisselberg has been the key to this sprawling global enterprise that has had Mob ties for decades. pic.twitter.com/BB1tBataEQ  It’s hard to decipher exactly but on p. 15 Unindicted co-conspirator 1 is the agent of the Trump Org underreported Weisselberg’s income. That seems to me likely to be former President Donald Trump. https://t.co/63j9SH1uOk  WATCH: Mary Trump reveals why she thinks her cousins are more likely to flip than Allen Weisselberg https://t.co/G0ezdyRWZ8 MSNBC's Rachel Maddow interviewed Mary Trump the psychologist who turned over Trump tax returns to the New York Times as part of the bombshell story. "I mean one of the -- I think the important threads to pull from that Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting at The New York Times based on Trump-financial records is that among others it appears that Ivanka Trump benefitted from the type of scheme that's described within the end of the indictment today" Maddow said. "That Trump executives were compensated in ways that were deliberately designed to help them evade taxes and to help the business evade taxes on their behalf." "Allen Weisselberg is being charged for benefitting from that scheme. The indictment says other executives also benefitted from that scheme. And now we have got solid reporting that the investigation continues" Maddow noted. "That raises the prospect that further charges could be brought against his children." "Yeah it does" Mary Trump replied. "And I -- again I think they should be quite anxious right now. Donald on the other hand will expect the same kind and level of loyalty from them as he expects from Allen." www.rawstory.com/...  Darn that disinformation flooding:  The agent who shot Babbitt was found to have acted properly defending congress and even possibly VP Pence; yet: Trump Demands Identity Of Officer Who Shot Capitol Rioter Ashli Babbitt Despite DOJ ‘Self-Defense’ Finding https://t.co/GL8TpkH08Y  So Donald Trump now asks: "Who shot Ashli Babbitt?"The answer: Have you no shame? Look in the mirror. It is you who are in large measure responsible for her death. She was in D.C. because of you. She stormed the Capitol because of you. She is not alive now because of you.  The leader of the Republican Party to whom most Republicans pledge their loyalty still supports the insurrection against America. https://t.co/sig4nttFP1 In doing so he also abandoned all pretense about the events of Jan. 6. He was with the insurrectionists then and he is with them now. Ashli Babbitt was the rioter who was shot dead by Capitol Police as she broke through the final barrier protecting huddled lawmakers from the violent mob attacking the House of Representatives. Now Trump has joined those extremists who cast Babbitt as the victim and the Capitol Police as the villains of that day. Now we know the disgraced former president still stands remorselessly and unapologetically with those who attempted the violent overthrow of Congress and of a democratic election. [...] www.washingtonpost.com/... Why are they worried about who shot Ashli Babbitt when she was ANTIFA BLM and an undercover FBI agent??
