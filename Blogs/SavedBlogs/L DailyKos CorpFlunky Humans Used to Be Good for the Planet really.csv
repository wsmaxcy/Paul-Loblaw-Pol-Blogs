L, "Humans Used to Be Good for the Planet" really?, CorpFlunky, 2021-04-20, “Humans Used to Be Good for the Planet And We Can Be Again” according to an article in Vice this morning.   It’s a short article but most of the points are wrong.   No actually everywhere humans migrated saw the extinction of megafauna: giant elephants bears antelope armadillos and sloths to name a few.  The dense early population growth of Mesopotamia around the Mediterranean and in central China’s Loess Plateau are all correlated with severe degradation of vegetation and with desertification.   No actually nature created diverse landscapes with many species.  Humans domesticated a few animals and selectively bred them but on a species level we’ve always been overwhelmingly destructive.   No actually the mega fires are primarily caused by the human driven climate crisis.  But even the initial wildfire sparks are 85% caused by humans.  The Trumpian idea that Smoky the Bear caused forest fires by preventing and fighting them is insane.  Forests take centuries to grow and have adapted to natural fires.  But ever since the arrival of man forests have been logged and have burned at unsustainable and unnatural rates which are now accelerating as we change the climate that once allowed forests to grow.   That correlation does not mean causality.  Every city on earth once was home to indigenous people without the technology to destroy ecosystems as rapidly as we can today.  That remote biodiverse areas still have a few indigenous people doesn’t prove that the indigenous people created the biodiversity.  Before Europeans colonized the US native societies in the Americas repeatedly collapsed their ecosystems: the Anasazi Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde to name a few from the four corners.   Frankly the thesis that our climate crisis can be fixed by “empowering indigenous stewardship” is unfair and racist.  Those indigenous communities were historically forced to leave more valuable land for less and just because they didn't kill as many species on their land as quickly as colonizers did on theirs doesn’t mean that it’s now the indigenous peoples’ job to save global biodiversity.   Sure we should support indigenous communities that protect their environment but that’s not enough.  We need to support all communities that protect their environment.  We need to stop using propane and gas powered engines in all communities including native reservations.  The climate crisis is global so why should the rich people who have been making money off of destroying ecosystems for centuries be allowed to pass on the cost and responsibility for saving the planet to the poor indigenous communities that they once displaced?  Why should more land be taken from the victims—even for preservation— while the descendants of the colonists continue to build more parking lots pollute the planet with micro plastics and produce enough carbon to acidify the oceans?   The original research behind the article has some good suggestions for increasing biodiversity in developed areas and for improving cooperation internationally but the above article reveals a common warped view of reality.  To address the climate crisis we need to be honest.  Humans have generally been bad for the planet have been getting increasingly worse and now we’re causing mass extinctions by making much of the planet uninhabitable.  We need to stop telling ourselves that a few other people are going to solve the problem whether it’s some new technological discovery or one tribe in the Amazon.  So far technology has made things worse and the indigenous tribes are losing.   A few people not limited by race have been fighting for biodiversity since Alexander von Humboldt set sail in 1799.  But now humans need to change deeply and immediately.  We need to elect leaders that will not just restore and protect tribal lands but leaders who will end the climate crisis by changing human behavior in all communities around the world from what’s left of the Amazon rainforest to Amazon.com among both natives and nativists your neighborhood and mine.   Comments are focusing on whether problem is solvable and what solutions are possible.  Here’s National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy on the administration’s priorities.
