L, Republicans Go To War With Major League Baseball, Kerry Eleveld, 2021-04-04, Stacey Abrams is a visionary advocate but she's also just a damn good politician. As rumors  swirled that Major League Baseball might pull the 2021 All-Star Game  from Georgia to protest the state's newly enacted voter suppression law  Abrams did what anyone eyeing a potential 2022 gubernatorial bid might  do she argued the case of her constituents.    In a USA Today op-ed published Wednesday Abrams urged corporate America to speak out against the voter suppression laws sweeping the nation but cautioned against boycotting the state.    "Boycotts work" Abrams acknowledged. But in order for them to work she added "the pain  of deprivation must be shared to be sustainable. Otherwise those least  resilient bear the brunt of these actions; and in the aftermath they  struggle to access the victory." Abrams ultimately argued that instead  of boycotting the state corporate America should find other ways of  supporting voting rights activists and holding Republican lawmakers  accountable.   "Leaving us behind won't save us" she wrote "So I ask you to bring your business to Georgia and if you’re already here stay and fight."          The op-ed put Abrams in a commanding political position no  matter what happened. If corporations held their fire she could  legitimately argue she had contributed to saving the state from economic  pain. If they boycotted she could both lament the revenue loss and  praise the intent which is exactly what she did when news broke Friday  that the MLB had would indeed yank the All-Star Game and draft from the state.    "Disappointed @MLB will move the All-Star Game but proud of their stance on voting rights" Abrams wrote on Twitter Friday. "GA GOP traded economic opportunity for suppression. On behalf of PoC targeted by #SB202 to lose votes + now wages I urge events & productions to come & speak out or stay & fight."    The statement put Abrams on the right side of every piece of  the argument: pulling for the bread and butter economics of Georgia  voters while still taking a righteous stand for voting rights. It also  left Republican Gov. Brian Kemp who signed the voter suppression bill  behind closed doors on the hook for what could amount to significant  revenue losses across the state.   Kemp with nowhere else to turn embraced the GOP's option of last resort: culture war politics. Republicans now longer run on policies just an airing of grievances.    “Georgians—and all Americans—should fully understand what the  MLB's knee-jerk decision means” Kemp said in a statement. “Cancel  culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your  life sports included. If the left doesn’t agree with you facts &  the truth do not matter."   If you're a Republican you know you're losing when your best  option is to attack the all-American sport of baseball. Next up: Kemp  will expose hot dogs and apple pie as traitorous staples of the Left.   At a Saturday press conference Kemp doubled down on his culture war saying leftists would "stop at nothing to silence all of us.” Asked about the possibility of a "snowball effect" of boycotts Kemp responded  "We are not wavering" adding "You can bow down to this cancel culture  but I will give you a warning: If you do it’s never enough."   Georgia Republicans think this a boon to the party. Kemp—who  has taken an onslaught of heat from Trump supporters for not overturning  the state's legitimate 2020 results—can finally be their hero against  cancel culture as Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Greg Bluestein noted.    We'll see if that's how things really play out in the long run. Sure enough Donald Trump chimed in  on Saturday morning encouraging his supporters to "boycott baseball"  over the MLB's stand against racism. But whatever Trump supporters make  of it so-called "cancel culture" may not play as well in the Georgia  suburbs where the revenue losses could be more top of mind. Republican  lawmakers are trying to pin the MLB's cancellation on Abrams as though  she was the one who passed an abhorrent law that has now become a  national symbol of renewed Jim Crow fervor across the country.    More than likely the MLB All-Star Game won't be the last of  the cancellations and subsequent financial loss. As Atlanta Mayor Keisha  Lance Bottoms noted Friday night "Unfortunately the removal of the @MLB All  Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall until the  unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box  are removed."   Just how costly could it be? Well for comparison's sake the  hateful "bathroom bill" targeting transgender Americans passed by North  Carolina Republicans in 2016 ultimately cost the state a whopping $3.76 billion  in lost business revenues according to an AP analysis conducted in  2017; even that was still considered to be an undercount of  the economic fallout. That's an enormous hit.    Additionally the GOP governor who signed that bill into law  Pat McCrory lost his reelection bid in November 2016 in what was  otherwise a very good year for Republicans nationally. Absent the  anti-trans bathroom bill McCrory almost surely would have been  reelected by a comfortable margin given that Trump won the Tar Heel  State by nearly 4 points.   There's a lot more innings left to play in this entire episode.  But Trump voters are still a total wild card in terms of turnout in any  election where Trump doesn't actually appear on the ballot. Georgia  Republicans are now betting heavily on some combination of Trumpers and  voter suppression to deliver statewide wins for the party in 2022 and  reclaim a U.S. Senate seat now held by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.    It's quite a bet. This right here is the fight of Stacey  Abrams’ life and Georgia Democrats now have the proven organizing  infrastructure to adapt to almost any voting environments Republicans  throw at them. Meanwhile Georgia Republicans are trying to motivate a  group of Trump voters whose lack of enthusiasm cost them those two U.S.  Senate seats to begin with.    If Abrams makes a gubernatorial bid next year alongside  Warnock's reelection effort it's hard to imagine a more energizing  scenario for the Democratic base in the face of Republicans' epic voter  suppression efforts. As for Republicans at this point it's not even  clear who their base is. They might manage to invigorate Trump voters by  stoking their anti-baseball culture war but what about the far more  dependable suburban voters who form the other side of their coalition?   Are those voters going to think losing tens of millions in  revenues—or even hundreds of millions—is worth a GOP culture war that  repositions the Peach State as a nostalgic throwback to the Confederacy  akin to Alabama and South Carolina? Georgia has spent decades trying to  escape that historical anchor on the way to a more prosperous and  progressive future—and it has largely succeeded as the rapid growth of  the state's suburbs have shown.   Now Republicans will be trying to sell those same suburban  voters on the notion that the only forward is going backward in time.  Trumpers in rural areas might happily take that bait but it remains to  be seen if GOP voters in the suburbs are willing to swallow that  backward thinking hook line and sinker.
