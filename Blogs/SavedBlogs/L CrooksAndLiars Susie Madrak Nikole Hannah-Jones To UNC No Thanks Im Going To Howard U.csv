L, Nikole Hannah-Jones To UNC: No Thanks I'm Going To Howard U, Susie Madrak, 2021-07-06, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Pulitzer Prize winner Nikole Hannah-Jones whose recent tenure application at University of North Carolina was initially turned down then approved last week after protests has turned down the job to accept a position at HBCU school Howard University. Via the Daily Beast: Speaking on CBS This Morning Hannah-Jones announced that she would instead take up the Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism at Howard University. Explaining her decision Hannah-Jones said: “It was a very difficult decision not a decision I wanted to make... Look what it took to get tenure. This was a position that since the 1980s came with tenure... Every other chair before me who also happened to be white received that position with tenure.” A week ago trustees at UNC-Chapel Hill finally approved tenure after weeks of controversy about why the school had tried to deny her that status. However she decided she no longer wanted the job saying: “To only have that vote occur on the last possible day at the last possible moment after threat of legal action after weeks of protest after it became a national scandal—it’s just not something that I want any more.” One other surprise at Howard University: Fellow Pulitzer winner Ta-Nahesi Coates will also be joining the faculty with her. Here is my full statement about my decision to decline tenure at UNC Chapel Hill and instead accept the inaugural Knight Chair in Race and Reporting at @HowardU. https://t.co/SDs9nJEB27 — Ida Bae Wells (@nhannahjones) July 6 2021 UNC’s loss is Howard’s gain.  https://t.co/E926zJx85N — Barbara Malmet (@B52Malmet) July 6 2021 UNC’s self-inflicted humiliation is now complete. https://t.co/CY5zCOdNIj — Slate (@Slate) July 6 2021 We offer @nhannahjones our profound apology for all she endured.
