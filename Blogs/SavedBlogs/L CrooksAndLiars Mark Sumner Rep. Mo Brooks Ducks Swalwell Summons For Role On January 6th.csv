L, Rep. Mo Brooks Ducks Swalwell Summons For Role On January 6th, Mark Sumner, 2021-05-08, On Jan. 6 in the hours just before insurgents overran the Capitol Republican Rep. Mo Brooks stood  on the “Stop the Steal” stage and delivered a message designed to set  the stakes for the already riled-up crowd.    “I’ve got a message that I need you to take to your heart and take  back home and along the way stop at the Capitol” said Brooks. “Today  Republican senators and congressmen will either vote to turn America  into a godless amoral dictatorial oppressed and socialist nation on  the decline or they will join us and they will fight and vote against  voter fraud and election theft and vote for keeping America great.” And  in case that invitation to “stop at the Capitol” was too subtle Brooks  made his intentions absolutely clear.          “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and  kicking ass” said Brooks. “Our ancestors sacrificed their blood their  sweat their tears their fortunes and sometimes their lives to give us  their descendants an America that is the greatest nation in world  history. So I have a question for you. Are you willing to do the same?”  Brooks then repeatedly shouted at the crowd “Will you fight for  America?” before saying “We American patriots are going to come right  at them!”   In March Brooks kicked off his campaign for senator in  Alabama with the goal of filling the seat left by retiring Senator  Richard Shelby. As CNN noted  at the time Brooks has placed his support for the Big Lie and that  speech on Jan. 6 right at the center of his campaign. Brooks is  literally running on his support for the insurgency.   But when it comes to facing a court case based on charges of incitement Brooks is running away.   As Axios reported on March 5 Rep. Eric Swalwell filed suit in U.S. District Court citing both Brooks and Donald Trump as being "responsible for the injury and destruction" of  the Jan. 6 attack. That lawsuit states that the deadly attack on the  Capitol including the attempt to kidnap and execute members of  Congress came “As a direct and foreseeable consequence of the  Defendants’ false and incendiary allegations of fraud and theft and in  direct response to the Defendants’ express calls for violence at the  rally.”   More than a month later Swalwell says Brooks is continuing to dodge process servers and refusing to be served with  the lawsuit. Others charges in the suit including Trump have waived  service—meaning that the case can proceed to court—but Brooks remains as  a lone holdout. He has neither waived service nor acknowledged the  paperwork that has been delivered to his office.    As Forbes reported  earlier this week Brooks is far from apologetic about his speech on  Jan. 6. In fact Brooks is using segments of that speech and attempts  by Democrats to censure him for his call to violence as cornerstones of  his campaign ads.    On Jan. 6 Brooks put out a brief statement that he “always condemns  violence.” However he followed this almost immediately with a tweet insisting  that the cause of violence was not the people he had just told to “kick  ass” and “come right at them” in an effort to save the nation. Instead  wrote Brooks the assault was conducted by “fascist ANTIFA”—a term that may set the record for cognitive dissonance.   Brooks has continued to repeat claims  that antifa was behind the attack. However in his campaign he has also  highlighted scenes of the Jan. 6 rally and stated that on that day “I  did my duty for my country.” The level of ridiculous self-contradictory  elements in Brooks’ statements may seem obvious but then he is running  as the most MAGA of a number of MAGA candidates vying for Shelby’s spot.  Being ridiculous is part of the job description.   As Swalwell’s attorney noted “It seems clear that Brooks is choosing  to make a political stunt out of a part of the process that essentially  is a formality which is unfortunate.” But Mo Brooks doing something  just because it would draw more attention to his campaign shouldn’t be a  surprise. Neither should his unwillingness to go to court and discuss  how he deliberately stirred up a crowd and told them to put their lives  on the line go to the Capitol and prevent America from becoming a  “godless amoral dictatorial oppressed and socialist nation.”   Brooks previously ran for the Senate in 2017 in the hopes of  capturing the seat that once belonged to Jeff Sessions. He enjoyed the  support of Trump along with Fox News personalities Laura Ingraham and  Sean Hannity. He came in third in the Republican primary. Published with permission from Daily Kos.
