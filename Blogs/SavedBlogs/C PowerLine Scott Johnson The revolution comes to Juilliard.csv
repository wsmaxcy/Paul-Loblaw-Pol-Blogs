C, The revolution comes to Juilliard, Scott Johnson, 2021-06-29, The Manhattan Institute’s invaluable Heather Mac Donald wrote “The revolution comes Juilliard” for MI’s City Journal last month. The story Heather tells is a tale of our time from the ever larger land beyond satire. Racial hysteria and opposition to Western civilization are among its themes. Heather’s column concludes:  A leader in the arts world told of Juilliard’s travails observes: “This is a crucial time to stand up and call out what is an overly emotional and irrational attack on the best of what humanity has to offer.” He would not allow me to reveal his name or affiliation. As I say beyond satire. Taking up her column Quillette‘s Jonathan Kay spoke with Heather “about how a single drama workshop caused Juilliard students to feel ‘traumatized’ and sparked an activist campaign aimed at undermining the elite school’s famously rigorous standards.” Heather expands on her column in their discussion. The column is linked above the Quillette podcast embedded below. Both are well worth your time.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
