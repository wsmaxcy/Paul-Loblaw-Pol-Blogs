L, Here's the only clip you need to see from last night's Loser-palooza, Aldous J Pennyfarthing, 2021-06-27, I saw snippets of last night’s grotesque spectacle in Ohio. It was bonkers. At one point The Former Guy said Democrats had tried to take Thomas Jefferson off Mount Rushmore. Or at least I think he said that. It’s sometimes hard for me to distinguish Donald Trump from horrifying bath salts hallucinations. And he gave The Pillow Man a shoutout from the dais. And his face was desperately crying out for a squeegee. There was even an impromptu “Lock her up!” chant.  Ah the good old days. Mostly though it was a nonstop salvo of thoroughly debunked election conspiracy fantasies cascading like pureed turnips from Grampa Rage Diapers’ filthy maw. In other words pretty much exactly what you’d expect. But I’m not here to share an “entertaining” series of video clips from last night’s dead-ender convention. Because there’s only one clip you need to see. This ... Exclusive: We sent @waltermasterson to yesterday’s Trump rally in Ohio and he spotted bored MAGAs leaving in droves during the speech. More to come. pic.twitter.com/yvbTNunZ0B  Yup those are MAGAs leaving the Branch Covidian compound in droves. His. Shtick. Is. Played. But maybe he can adapt and change.     Hmm. Or maybe not.  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter that is). What is it? The viral letter that launched four hilarious Trump-trolling books. Get them all including the finale Goodbye Asshat: 101 Farewell Letters to Donald Trump at this link. Just $12.96 for the pack of 4!
