L, The Pandemic isn't over yet. Remember that., GreyHawk, 2021-07-05, If you haven't seen the news 85 campers and staffers at an Illinois summer camp have come down with COVID. This wasn't simply predictable: it was something allegedly taken into account over the months preceding the arrival of summer.Two @washingtonpost articles just over 1 month apart illustrate this.  The pandemic isn't over. People shouldn’t ignore that and act as though it's no longer a concern. Be responsible. Encourage others to be responsible. The influx & resurgence of COVID19 infections and the dominance of the deadly Delta variant aren’t a joke it’s not a hoax and the global pandemic isn’t over. Let’s encourage people to keep that in mind. There’s an unfortunate surge in maskholes and anti-vaccination folks who are convincing others that vaccinations aren’t necessary or that they can stop with only 1 of the 2 vaccine doses and that masks aren’t really necessary anywhere anymore. They’re literally killing us — themselves and others — with their politically-spawned willful & malicious ignorance.
