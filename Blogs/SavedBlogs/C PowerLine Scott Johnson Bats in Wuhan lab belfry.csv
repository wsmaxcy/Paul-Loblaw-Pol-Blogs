C, Bats in Wuhan lab belfry, Scott Johnson, 2021-06-15, Sky News Australia has posted the video of Sharri Markson’s 16-minute report on the Wuhan lab that appears to have been the source of the Covid-19 scourge with the following summary appended: The Wuhan Institute of Virology kept live bats in cages new footage from inside the facility has revealed disproving denials from World Health Organisation investigators who claimed the suggestion was a “conspiracy”. An official Chinese Academy of Sciences video to mark the launch of the new biosafety level 4 laboratory in May 2017 speaks about the security precautions that are in place if “an accident” occurs and reveals there had been “intense clashes” with the French Government during the construction of the laboratory. The video shows bats being held in a cage at the Wuhan Institute of Virology along with vision of a scientist feeding a bat with a worm.  The 10 minute video is titled “The construction and research team of Wuhan P4 laboratory of Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences” and features interviews with its leading scientists.  The World Health Organisation report investigating the origin of the pandemic failed to mention that any bats had been kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and only its annex referred to animals being housed there.  “The animal room in the P4 facility can handle a variety of species including primate work with SARS-CoV-2” it states. A member of the World Health Organisation team investigating the origin of the pandemic in Wuhan zoologist Peter Daszak said it was a conspiracy to suggest bats were held at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In one tweet dated December 2020 he said: “No BATS were sent to Wuhan lab for genetic analysis of viruses collected in the field. That’s now how this science works. We collect bat samples send them to the lab. We RELEASE bats where we catch them!”  In another tweet dated December 11 2020 he said: “This is a widely circulated conspiracy theory. This piece describes work I’m the lead on and labs I’ve collaborated with for 15 years. They DO NOT have live or dead bats in them. There is no evidence anywhere that this happened. It’s an error I hope will be corrected.”  This month Daszak appeared to retract his earlier denials and admitted the Wuhan Institute of Virology may have housed bats but admitted he had not asked them. The Chinese Academy of Sciences video was discovered by researchers investigating the origin of the pandemic who call themselves DRASTIC.  Digital archivist “Jesse” found the Chinese Academy of Sciences Video while the group’s co-ordinator who goes by a pseudonym of “Billy Bostickson” for safety reasons has long complained evidence bats were housed in the Wuhan laboratories.  The video forms part of the investigation for [Markson’s] book “What Really Happened in Wuhan”….Mr Daszak has not responded to requests for comment. Tom Lifson has more in the American Thinker post “Stunning video reveals Daszak and WHO lied when claiming no bats in the Wuhan Lab” which brought the video to my attention. Tom concludes: Ms. Markson is way ahead of the rest of the world’s journalists on this story — a story whose importance dwarfs that of other news because the world has been turned upside-down millions have died countless businesses have been closed and lives upended by a virus whose origins have been deliberately obscured by people with as Markson notes serious conflicts of interest (to put it mildly). The Marskon/Sky News video is below.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
