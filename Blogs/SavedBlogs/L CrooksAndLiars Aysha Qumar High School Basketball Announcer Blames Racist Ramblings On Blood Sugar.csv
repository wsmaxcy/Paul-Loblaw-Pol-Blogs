L, High School Basketball Announcer Blames Racist Ramblings On Blood Sugar, Aysha Qumar, 03-15-21, An entire girls basketball team decided to kneel during the national anthem of the Oklahoma 6A state basketball tournament Thursday  night. Playing against Midwest City High School every member of the  Norman High School girls team knelt but instead of being applauded for  their stance against racism and police brutality announcers on the  National Federation of State High School Association (NFHS) Network's  official live stream attempted to degrade the players by using  disgusting racial slurs.   Clearly forgetting to turn off their mic during the anthem the  game announcers were heard making racist and derogatory comments  toward the players. “They're kneeling? I hope Norman gets their ass  kicked" one announcer could be heard saying. Another said "F**k  Norman. I hope they lose. C’mon Midwest City. They're gonna kneel like  that? Hell no." Later in the clip an announcer could be heard  muttering “F*cking [N-words].”   Video clips of the incident posted by the program's junior  varsity coach Frankie Parks have since gone viral. Alongside sharing the  clip social media users noted that racism like this is the reason why  people kneel for the anthem. “See why we do it!?! They still think it’s  about the flag” NFL player Gerland McCoy who also kneels for the  anthem said on Twitter.   WARNING: Video below contains disturbing language. every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess. disgusting. and people want to know why we kneel. here’s a prime example of why we do it. i’m proud of my team and i for using our voices and being heard. I love my girls & let’s finish. #MORETHANANATHLETE https://t.co/K8AX2xCSCa — Chantae Embry (@chantae_embry) March 12 2021 In response to the incident multiple members of the team the school’s athletic director T.D. O'Hara and its leadership teacher have tweeted out a graphic with the words "THIS IS WHY WE KNEEL." pic.twitter.com/kgfI4MneB9 — TD O'Hara (@tohara_o) March 12 2021 Students are using the incident as a chance to spread awareness of racism. Disrespectful and disgusting. This is why we kneel. I love my sisters and this makes us that much stronger. You are part of the problem. https://t.co/uxUtbXCqYS — Myka Perry (@mykagp_) March 12 2021 According to ABC News affiliate WFAA announcers for the NFHS broadcast were contracted by the Oklahoma  Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA). While both have not yet  been identified multiple sources have identified one announcer as  Scott Sapulpa The Oklahoman reported. Sapulpa  is listed as the head high school football coach at Hulbert a school  in northeast Oklahoma. Calls to hold him the other announcer and the  association accountable have ensued. Update: In a statement released Friday announcer Matt Rowan admitted it was his voice using hate speech to describe children. He then blamed his racist ramblings on his blood sugar. ........in the statement Matt Rowan blames his racist comments and use of the n-word on type 1 diabetes. HE BLAMED RACISM ON HIS SUGAR SPIKE. pic.twitter.com/g8LzRjTiQX — Taylor Rooks (@TaylorRooks) March 12 2021 It was not until a subsequent interview with TMZ Sports that Rowan bothered to apologize to the student athletes whom he’d  insulted. He also claimed he wasn’t trying to hide behind his diabetes.       The network issued a statement Friday noting that it is “aggressively investigating” the incident and “condemns racism hate and discrimination.” The NFHS  streams high school games not only in Oklahoma but around the country  so such behavior is unacceptable and a statement issuing an apology is  not enough.   After issuing a statement Friday in support of its students and their resilience Norman Public Schools superintendent Nick Migliorino confirmed that Norman Public Schools would no longer allow NFHS to broadcast its games.   “We condemn and will not tolerate the disgusting words and attitudes of these announcers” Migliorino said in a statement.  “This type of hate speech has no place in our society and we are  outraged that it would be directed at any human being and particularly  at our students.”   “We fully support our students’ right to freedom of expression and  our immediate focus is to support these girls and their coaches and  families particularly our Black students and coaching staff. It is  tragic that the hard work and skill of this team is being overshadowed  by the vile malignant words of these individuals. We will do everything  in our power to support and uplift our team and everyone affected by  this incident.”   Additionally Norman mayor Breea Clark also tweeted  about the incident Friday saying she was "livid and absolutely  disgusted with the broadcaster's “racist and hateful comments” and plans  to schedule a "listening session town hall" to hear how this incident  has impacted the youth of the city in efforts to learn how the community  can be improved. She also called for OSSAA to end their contract with  NFHS Network.   "(NFHS) employees do not need to be anywhere near children" Clark's tweet read.  "Further these young women & their team deserve a public apology  from NFHS and OSSAA. There is NO PLACE for this behavior in our nation  & certainly not in youth sports.”   Despite the announcers’ racist slurs and hopes the team would lose Norman defeated Midwest City 53-40 and advanced to Friday’s state semifinals game against Union!
