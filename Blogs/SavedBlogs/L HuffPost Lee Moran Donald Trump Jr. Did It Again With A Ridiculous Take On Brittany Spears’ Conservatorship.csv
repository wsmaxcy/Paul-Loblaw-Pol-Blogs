L, Donald Trump Jr. Did It Again With A Ridiculous Take On 'Brittany' Spears’ Conservatorship, Lee Moran, 2021-06-30, Donald Trump Jr. drew ridicule on Twitter Tuesday for his hot take on the conservatorship that pop star Britney Spears has been under for the last 13 years. Spears last week made an emotional plea in court to end the arrangement. Former President Donald Trump’s son attempted to politicize the control that Spears’ father Jamie Spears has exerted over his daughter’s life with this post in which he spelled the singer’s first name wrong: How many Americans rightly concerned about Brittany Spears’ conservatorship had no problems with America’s conservatorship under blue state governors for the past year??? I’m guessing close to 100% Critics were confused by Trump Jr.’s false equivalence and angered by his typo: Britney!  You could at least try to get it right Swing and a miss. This makes zero sense One of the worst takes. Ever. It's not even a good metaphor. 2+2=7 If you actually care about Britney’s situation there are a million things you can do to help her. Don’t use her unimaginable pain to to push whatever narrative you have It's Britney not Brittany Running out of material are we? Again…Jr reminds us he is not an intellectual giant. Brittany?Seriously you don’t know how her name is spelled?Do you even remember who she is Junior? Let’s compare apples and whales shall we? *Britney Spears The stretching here is amazing. That’s a stretch Jr. Man you’re trying so hard to stay relevant.
