L, McConnell's Sock Puppet Daniel Cameron Claims There Is No Systemic Racism In America., Merlin196357, 2021-04-26, Kentucky State Attorney General Daniel Cameron does NOT believe there is systemic racism in the U.S.   Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said Sunday he doesn't believe the U.S. is systemically racist — a statement that drew the ire of other notable Black Louisvillians. He made the comment in an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo who aired a clip of President Joe Biden saying "systemic racism is a stain on our nation's soul." Then she asked Cameron if he believes the U.S. is systemically racist. "Well no I don't believe this country is systemically racist" Cameron a Republican who is also Kentucky's first Black attorney general told her. "What I believe is that this country has always tried from the very beginning to become a more perfect union. And certainly we've had our challenges throughout this nation's history and there's no hiding from that. Challenges.  I like that.  Slavery was just a challenge then?  Jim Crow laws were just a challenge?  Those lynching of black men and women by racist mobs were just challenges?   How bad is it when a black man lies for white racism are so obvious that an old white guy calls BS on you?  Answer:  it’s pretty fuckin’ bad. As a reminder this was the guy who botched a grand jury investigation into the killing of Breonna Taylor by Louisville cops.  And he tanked it on purpose.  Cameron does not want to upset Kentucky voters who love cops who kill black people.  I’ll be blunt enough to say that.  And given the latest data that nearly half of all Republicans think that the Chauvin trail verdict was wrong I imagine I’m not hyperbolic when I say  more than a few Kentucky voters like what Cameron did with the Breonna Taylor case. And in case anyone forgets Cameron is Mitch McConnell’s protegee. I’m just glad the Courier-Journal got some responses from local black leaders to Daniel Cameron’s interview with Fox Business.  Here is just one (I’d put them all up but I’ve had some accuse me of stealing so I will just give you this one response.  You can read the rest with the link). Senior Pastor F. Bruce Williams of Bates Memorial Baptist Church in Louisville tweeted: "AG Daniel Cameron is intelligent enough to know that this claim panders to powers that promise him privilege. ... He’s a disgrace. But Bruh just because you’ve forgotten you’re Black doesn’t mean that the racist(s) who are using you have." Emphasis is mine. Cameron also defended Georgia’s latest voter repression law and he now blames Biden for “dividing” our country.  Cameron also implies that racism is not a “big issue.” Bottom line is that the black community in Kentucky especially Louisville knows that Cameron is a sock puppet for McConnell.  Cameron wants to be the next senator from KY when McConnell retires.  And Kentuckians are a racist bunch and they love Trump and all his attacks on POC.  Hell Kentuckians may vote for Cameron for higher office because he is so useful to them.  How can Kentuckians be racist if we elect a black man who goes around shitting on POC and pushes other Trumpian policies?
