L, Michael Collins dies astronauts grow veggies in space but many Americans are science ignorant, HalBrown, 2021-04-29, Michael Collins dubbed by NASA as the loneliest man in space because he was the commander of the orbiting module on the first lunar mission and never got to set foot on the moon died yesterday. Here’s the NASA announcement. By coincidence the day before he died NASA also announced that for the first time plants were grown and consumed on the International Space Station:  For the past year the world has been focused on the advances in science which led to the Covid vaccines. Far too many Americans are sorely ignorant about science. Many of those who refuse to get vaccinated for Covid have no comprehension of why it was possible to develop the current mRNA vaccines so quickly and to have them be highly effective.  My hunch is that they don't have the basic science education to understand this rather simple CDC webpage on understanding the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. Science oriented stories like this about NASA don’t lead the headlines but considering that we have suffered though four years of an anti-science actually a pseudoscience Administration it is important to recognize the important advances in all scientific endeavors.
