C, It’s not easy being Greene, Scott Johnson, 2021-02-05, The House — i.e. House Democrats joined by 11 Republicans on a near party-line vote — removed Republican outlier Marjorie Taylor Greene from the committees to which she had been assigned. The AP story on the vote is here. Condemning the remarks that have brought Greene into disrepute Senator Tom Cotton commented further on yesterday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow:  “Make no mistake plenty of Democrats do and say outlandish things too. Ilhan Omar has made multiple anti-Semitic statements. Maxine Waters urged mobs to attack Trump administration officials. Eric Swalwell cavorted with a Chinese spy. Chuck Schumer threatened two Supreme Court justices [if] they didn’t rule the way he wanted. I don’t see MSNBC and CNN and the liberal media calling them out for it.” “But just because Democrats and the media accept that doesn’t mean we should” Cotton added. “We want to win elections. We see the consequences right now of losing elections in the Senate when Chuck Schumer is jamming through a two-trillion-dollar giveaway to liberal special interests and the next up is amnesty. The DREAM Act is coming down the pipe.” Cotton went on “The way to stop this woke Democratic agenda is to win elections and we will win elections with strong credible conservatives who stand up for America. If our party tolerates conspiracy theories then we’re only going to lose elections and America is going to be much worse for it.” Cotton stated “What the Democrats proposed to do to reach into the minority and decide who the minority party is going to put on committees is unprecedented and if they go down that path then mark my words Republicans in two years we’ll go down the same path. Should Ilhan Omar who’s made multiple anti-Semitic statements be sitting on the Foreign Relations Committee? Should Eric Swalwell cavorting with a Chinese spy be sitting on the Intelligence Committee?” Cotton added “This is a very dangerous precedent that the Democratic majority in the House wants to set when they’re on the precipice of losing that majority next year. What Democrats and the liberal media want to do is to leverage a fringe of extremist statements and violence from the right against mainstream conservatives in a way that they would never do on the left.” Cotton recalled “Remember it was a Bernie Sanders supporter who showed up in Alexandria Virginia and shot Steve Scalise almost killed him and tried to commit mass murder against congressional Republicans and would have done so if it hadn’t been for the bravery and quick action of Capitol police officers who were there at that ballpark.” “When it was discovered that that was a Bernie Sanders supporter it was out of the news within 24 hours not something that could be discussed and frankly a lot of Republicans didn’t discuss it either because he was plainly a crazy person and there was not an effort by Republicans writ large to leverage that kind of extremist violence or extremist rhetoric … against mainstream Democratic liberals” concluded Cotton.
