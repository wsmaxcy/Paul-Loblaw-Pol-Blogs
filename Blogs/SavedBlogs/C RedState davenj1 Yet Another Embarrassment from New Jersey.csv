C, Yet Another Embarrassment from New Jersey, davenj1, 2020-12-17, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) otherwise an afterthought in Congress managed to get his proverbial fifteen minutes of fame when he tweeted out that any member of Congress who supported the Texas (and others) Supreme Court petition (since dismissed) against Pennsylvania and other states should be barred from being sworn in under the Fourteenth Amendment specifically Section 3.  That part states: No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress or elector of President and Vice President or hold any office civil or military under the United States or under any state who having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer of the United States or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive or judicial officer of any state to support the Constitution of the United States shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House remove such disability. As we know the 14th Amendment was passed in the aftermath of the Civil War.  This particular section was designed to keep those who were main actors in the Confederacy out of elected office.  It was not directed at would-be insurrectionists or rebellious actors but at actual ones.  Further the final sentence allowed even those deemed to be an “insurrectionist” an opportunity to hold elected office if both houses of Congress agreed by a two-thirds vote. Enter Pascrell obviously no student of American history or the 14th Amendment.  To this dolt questioning the outcome of an election is tantamount to insurrection or rebellion.  Even if there is evidence of fraud or illegitimacy your musings are insurrectionist and rebellious and you may not hold political office in the United States. We can take Pascrell’s “logic” and apply it to the Democrats circa 2016.  That should be recent enough in this idiot’s mind to remember that a large part of his own party and political ideology did not view Trump’s victory in that year as legitimate and they said so.  In fact within two days after the realization set in that Trump defeated the Crone of Chappaqua the #Resistance was formed and took to the streets.  There have been a few pro-Trump rallies in the aftermath of the 2020 election and one supposes that Pascrell would have all those participants excluded for “insurrection” also.  After all they were acting out in the streets what members of Congress were saying on paper by signing onto the Texas petition. In fact Pascrell was first elected to Congress in 1996 so he must have remembered the illegitimacy of Bush’s victory in 2000 and all the talk from his side of the aisle.  Yet apparently not and he like most Democrats seems to suffer from selective memory. Admittedly this clown hails from a Congressional district that is basically an extension of Manhattan and their woke and liberal ideology.  A literal donkey can run for the Democrats in this district and defeat Jesus Christ himself if Jesus had an “R” after his name. Maybe Pascrell is simply trying to burnish his liberal credentials and wants to be the first male member of the Squad.  Or maybe he burnt the midnight candle actually reading the Constitution and came across the 14th Amendment.  Imagine the orgasmic glee he experienced when he finally got to Section 3. Some Republican Congresspeople have introduced a bill to censure Pascrell not for the Tweet but for sending a letter to officials in certain swing states filing a complaint against the Trump campaign for filing “frivolous” election-related lawsuits.  This will go nowhere in a Pelosi-led House but the letter sent by Pascrell and his follow-up Tweet shines a light on what many of us on the Right know:  Democrats/the Left are Constitutionally illiterate. To Pascrell the Trump campaign exercising a constitutional right to challenge the election results in a court of law is engaging in an unconstitutional action and his supporters are engaging in rebellion and insurrection.  He fired back: Donald Trump and his minions are trying to steal the election after getting blown out by President-elect Joe Biden. His lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits in taxpayer-funded courts are accomplices to Trump’s assault on American democracy and they must be held accountable. I have proudly called for them to lose their law licenses. Fascist wannabes won’t muzzle my free speech or stop me from defending our republic. Those supporting this pathetic resolution are complicit in Trump’s attempt to become a dictator. Yes- Bill Pascrell fearless defender of the republic standing up to the fascism of Republican lawmakers.  Psychological projection never knew a better example than Pascrell. What we do know is that until very recently Pascrell was an afterthought who suddenly discovered he had a Twitter account.  Maybe AOC showed him how to use it.  His biography states he holds a BA and Masters from Fordham University.  That does not say much for Fordham University. The good news is that Pascrell is 83-years-old.  That’s five years older than the president-elect Joe Biden and we all know about his senility.  With Pascrell perhaps he suffers from syphilis of the brain… who knows?  The good news is that his Congressional career is nearing an end either through retirement or a visit from the Grim Reaper.  The bad news is that voters of New Jersey’s Ninth Congressional district will likely send another moron with a “D” after their name to Washington.  Being New Jersey Pascrell has probably anointed his successor and it may just be a family member.
