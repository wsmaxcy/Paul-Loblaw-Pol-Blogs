L, Parenting Politics and Policing in Oakland Ca, potty mouth, 2021-06-28, Historically Oakland youth and families have had little voice in Oakland and Alameda County politics and budgeting. We struggle to educate our children with substandard schools a poverty of resources and a lack of public spaces for children families and teens to just be. As a result Oakland and Alameda County have spent years de-prioritizing services which support families: libraries parks arts recreation programs and mental health for youth and families. Parents toil endlessly with the schools and if they dare to complain to the mayor they are told to go to a meeting to volunteer or to vote for a bond. Politicians promise that bonds will save the schools the libraries prevent violence and create jobs for youth. This never results in meaningful changes for youth and families. The chronic under-representation of family and youth voices has resulted in a supposedly progressive democratic City (Oakland) & County (Alameda) having built a robust school to prison pipeline a mega-prison (Santa Rita) a mega-juvenile hall and a nano-county hospital & trauma center (Highland). As the saying goes “build it and they will come.” As we emerge and try to recover from a pandemic which exposed in excruciating detail the absence of a funded health system Mayor Schaaf and Alameda County Supervisors pivot back to the status quo doubling down on crime police prisons and punishment while calling for fiscal accountability (read “spending cuts”) from healthcare and family support services. After over a year of lockdown my children parents and I struggle with anxiety and depression. Deferred healthcare issues emerge and my children both need and resent the structure routines and support we put in place just to get by. We have two jobs two cars a home a garden and six pets. Many children and youth in Oakland have lost their school their family members may have lost jobs. Youth and families remain at risk of losing their homes and others have lost caregivers. Covid killed elders who provided love housing food and family for Oakland youth and children. Mayor Schaaf Supervisor Nate Miley Supervisor Keith Carson and Supervisor Wilma Chan had no plan to support youth & families devastated by this crisis. Why are we surprised that we have a crime wave?
