L, Friday FP and IE Open Thread: Around the World: State(s) of Deep Water- Large Lakes Larger Problems, ian douglas rushlauforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-04-23, Apparently it is a matter of some dispute as to which are the largest lakes in the world (and even what constitutes a lake!). Truth be told I couldn’t care less about such rankings. Here’s what I do care about— how imperiled our freshwater systems are by pollution and the warming of the planet because of carbon combustion. And the absurd geopolitical conflicts that exacerbate the struggle for every person to have sufficient access to life-sustaining water. However we choose to categorize them largest freshwater bodies contain contain an immense amount of water and support massive ecosystems. And they are under threat. #DYK that almost one-third of freshwater biodiversity face extinction?Join #BiodiversityDay today and share your actions - we're part of the solution #ForNature.Log ongoing work for #Goal6 here: https://t.co/StQzCKoZcN pic.twitter.com/BynvsBAhHZ  In 2050 our planet will need to provide food for an estimated 9 to 10 billion people.

If we would include the Caspian Sea on the list we’d find it dwarfing everything else. It holds 18761 cubic miles (78200 cubic kilometers) of water by volume more than three times more water than all of the U.S. Great Lakes combined. It’s also the third deepest 3363 feet (1025 meters).  #Kazakhstan authorities detained at least 20 people as demonstrators staged anti-China protests on March 27. The protesters rallied against #China’s increasing influence and economic power in the former #Soviet republic.

Wesselingh  Communications Earth & Environment  vol 1 Article number: 69 (2020)  Sea level in the Caspian Sea is projected to fall by 9–18 m in medium to high emissions scenarios until the end of this century7 caused by a substantial increase in lake evaporation that is not balanced by increasing river discharge or precipitation. According to these new projections twenty-first century Caspian sea level decline will be about twice as large as estimates based on earlier climate models89. A decline by 9–18 m will mean that the vast northern Caspian shelf the Turkmen shelf in the southeast and all coastal areas in the middle and southern Caspian Sea emerge from under the sea surface. In addition the Kara-Bogaz-Gol Bay on the eastern margin will be completely desiccated. Overall the Caspian Sea’s surface area will shrink by 23% for a 9 m and by 34% for an 18 m drop of sea level (see Fig. 1)… The projected Caspian sea level decline combined with the loss of the highly productive and seasonally ice-covered northern Caspian shelf will severely affect this unique ecosystem which is already under immense stress due to pollution over-exploitation and the introduction of invasive species10. The reduction in winter sea-ice area will affect pupping grounds for the endangered Caspian seal11. The disappearance of the vast shelf further robs the Caspian Sea of shallow-water habitats that are major food sources (e.g. for fish migrating birds and the endemic seal) and provide spawning grounds for native and endemic fish species such as the endangered sturgeons. Current protected areas in the Caspian Sea most of which cover coastal ecosystems including highly coveted wetlands such as the Volga Delta and other Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance named after the Caspian coastal city of Ramsar Iran) will be transformed beyond recognition. Fluvial input of pollutants and surplus nutrients that bypasses the emerged shelf areas will directly impact the central basin. Together with higher productivity driven by higher temperatures river inputs will reduce oxygen availability. Emerging dead zones will likely affect biodiversity hotspots in both shallow and deeper parts of the Caspian Sea very similar to the current expansion of such zones in the oceans12. The expected escalating effects of Caspian sea level decline are likely to lead to a wholesale reorganization of ecosystems and threaten unique Caspian biota that have been evolving in the basin over millions of years13.  Crisis in the Caspian Sea: The world’s largest lake drying up?#Iran #CaspianSeahttps://t.co/CI0WrQbfyg Lake Tanganyika: Lake Tanganyika like some other large lakes on this list was formed by movements of tectonic plates and thus is called a rift lake. The lake borders for countries: Tanzania Zambia Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It measures 410 miles (660 km) long the longest of any freshwater lake. In addition to being the second largest by volume Lake Tanganyika is the second oldest and the second deepest at 4710 ft (1436 m).

Set deep within the Russian subcontinent Baikal is the deepest oldest and most voluminous of all lakes a superstar of superlatives in hydrology geology ecology and history. The lake is more than 5300 feet deep (exact figures vary) at its most profound point which lies about 4000 feet below sea level. With 12248 square miles of surface area Baikal averages 2442 feet deep—its crescent moon-shaped figure a vast rift valley that first appeared about 25 million years ago through the divergence of the planet’s crust. Today Lake Baikal contains some 20 percent of the earth’s lake and river water making this Russian giant comparable in volume to the entire Amazon basin. So huge is Baikal that it reportedly takes an average of 330 years for a single water molecule to flow through it from inlet to outlet. Lake Baikal features 27 islands including one 45 miles in length called Olkhon while in and around Baikal live more than 1500 animal species about 80 percent of which live nowhere else on the planet.  ‘Diving into lake Baikal’s blue abyss was alike walking into outer space’ - cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy on his current trip to the world’s oldest and deepest lake and on seeing that endemic Baikal seal so close. Video via kombattour pic.twitter.com/lTEdjZPhzL  The history and cultures of the peoples of the Baikal Region: The region has a rich heritage of nature-revering Mongolian Buryat and Evenk cultures. Some 1200 archaeological remains of past cultures have been found around the lake shores: 1000 such monuments have legal protection: rock drawings stone walls and the ruins of ancient settlements. Lake Baikal and the Selenga River are mentioned in ancient Chinese chronicles Muslim historical manuscripts and old Russian books. The Huns Kaganates of the Zhouzhanhs ancient Turks Uighurs and Kidanhs who maintained broad international relations with both the East and the West lived around the Lake. The 13th century Mongolian leader Genghis Khan is popularly supposed to have been born on Ol’khun island where there is a revered shamanic shrine. Buddhist and Russian Orthodox churches and a number of Old Believers also co-exist there. The local population is composed of several ethnic groups: Buryats the largest indigenous race in Siberia Evenks and Russians who first colonised the region in the mid 18th century. The population living permanently in the Lake Baikal basin is about one hundred thousand people and two million live in its catchment area. About half of the population is urban the remainder live in villages. The main occupations are forestry agriculture fisheries hunting and tourism. The chief towns in the area are Severobaikalsk Selenginsk Babushkin Baikalsk and Sludyanka. The territories of these five towns are excluded from the World Heritage property.

But many fear the influx of visitors and their garbage is imperilling it and there is deep mistrust over the Putin government's efforts to manage the issue. Chris Brown/ CBC News April 5 2021 We're 5000 kilometres east of the capital Moscow on the western side of Baikal. Stretching 640 kilometres the crescent-shaped lake is about twice the length of Lake Ontario although only about a third as wide. Baikal's immensity though isn't best appreciated by the area it covers but rather its tremendous depth. The lake bottom in several spots descends further than any other body of freshwater — more than 1600 metres — four times the deepest part of Lake Superior. Baikal is also the world's oldest lake — formed 25 million years ago. That makes it ancient compared to the Great Lakes which filled up only 15000 years ago or so after the last ice age. If there's one symbol of the tourism boom that's engulfed Baikal it's the hivus (pronounced hee-voos) or hovercraft in Russian… The influx of visitors has transformed Baikal's traditional resource-based economy and enriched many who live on its shores. In a single decade impoverished former fishing villages have been infused with new wealth and a sense of purpose. Many young people who grew up in the area are now choosing to stay attempting to make a living in their home communities rather than going somewhere else… The main town of Khuzhir population 1900 is made up of simple wooden homes and dirt roads. But it has been expanding quickly and there is plenty of evidence of new buildings that have gone up in the last two or three years. The main landmark is a rocky spit known as Shaman Rock which overlooks the ice with stunning panoramic views. For many it's the most sacred part of the lake long revered by members of the Buryat nation the Indigenous people of the area. Thirteen prayer poles perched at the top of the hill and wrapped in colourful ribbons represent 13 deities of nature. "It was so sacred that your average person wasn't even allowed to stand close to it" said Vitaly Ryabtsev a bird and wildlife biologist who lives in nearby Irkutsk. Ryabstev has emerged as a vigorous opponent of Baikal's rapidly expanding tourism industry arguing the pollution and waste it generates have already harmed the delicate ecosystem. "Tourism ... is the No. 1 polluter of Lake Baikal" he told CBC News in Olkhon.  Wildfire season started in Krasnoyarsk region with three large fires extinguished during the last 24hours. Overall in Russia the number of wildfires is rapidly growing with the current total area of 7000+ hectares.

The scientists also blamed existing environmental regulations for preventing the launch of wastewater treatment facilities built in 2017. Lake Victoria: Kenya Tanzania and Uganda share Lake Victoria. It is the worlds largest tropical lake and the second largest freshwater lake. Lake Victoria touches the Equator in its northern side. It covers a total area of 68800 sq. km [km²] and with a maximum depth of 80 m it is relatively shallow. A population of over 30 million people live in its basin. The ecological health of Lake Victoria has been affected profoundly as a result of a rapidly growing population clearance of natural vegetation along the shores a booming fish-export industry the introduction of several exotic plant and animal species the disappearance of about 50 % of its fish species (it had 400 species of Cichlids) prolific growth of algae and dumping of untreated effluent by several industries and human settlements. The Nile perch was introduced to the lake to improve fish stock but now it is responsible for the extinction of many indigenous fish species. Much of the damage is vast and irreversible. Traditional lifestyles of lakeshore communities have been disrupted and are crumbling. There is a consensus among conservationists that if an accelerated push to save the lake is not made soon this important body of water will cease to sustain life.  “Almost every night you see these intense thunderstorms and sometimes even water tornadoes developing over the lake because it’s a really favorable environment for storms.” https://t.co/9lIbc0QiIB pic.twitter.com/rKWCxWjnv5  In 100000 years Lake Victoria has dried up three times—it could happen again On a clear day you cannot see the other side of Lake Victoria yet this vast body of water has dried up several times in the past—and it could happen again. Over the past 100000 years the lake has completely dried up at least three times. Each time it was probably replaced by a vast grassland. My colleagues and I found that the lake could dry up again in as little as 500 years because of changes in temperature rainfall and orbital forcing – the effect on climate of slow changes in the tilt of the Earth’s axis. Our predictions are based on historical and geologic data from the last 100000 years.   Calming the Waters: The East African Community and Conflict over the Nile Resources PETER KAGWANJA Human Sciences Research Council Pretoria Journal of Eastern African Studies Vol. 1 No. 3 321337 November 2007 Sitting on the headwaters of the Nile including Lake Victoria the three East African countries of Kenya Uganda and Tanzania lie firmly in the vortex of this potential international conflict over the Nile resources. Tensions over the Nile waters have increased as a result of spiralling demand for water to generate hydroelectric power for drinking and irrigation amid acute poverty food insecurity wrought by cycles of drought and famine and growing population. [pg.321] For the three principal East African states Kenya Uganda and Tanzania the use of the resources of Lake Victoria and its catchments areas has been a prime concern. The EAC has also ended internal divisions within East Africa enabling them to forge unity in challenging the Egyptian and Sudanese monopoly over the Nile waters. At the same time following the Sadat era Egypt has relaxed its position making it possible to form the Nile Basin Initiative in 1999. Its Minister for Water Resources and Irrigation (WRI) Mahmoud Abu-Zeid promised in March 2004 that ‘Whatever decisions that are spelt out in the framework Egypt will accept.’4 But the issue of an outdated international law still persists. Discussions of water and security in the Nile Basin are informed by the overarching debate on whether or not water stress is a potential cause of wars. Two opposing viewpoints on water and international security have gained ground in both academic and policy circles: one viewpoint ubiquitous in the corridors of international policy institutions is that conflicts over water will lead to acute international conflict- the notion of ‘looming water wars’. Former United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali- an Egyptian national- teed off the debate when he declared in the1980s that future wars would be fought over water. Boutros-Ghali reiterated his warning in 2005 urging the international community to ensure an equitable sharing of water between nations to prevent future wars in Africa and the Middle East.5 Within the Bretton Woods institutions the water-security thesis was given a boost in 1995 when Ismail Serageldin vice-president of the World Bank said that: ‘The wars of the next century will be about water’.6 The ‘environmental security’ angle to this argument draws acausal link between water scarcity and acute conflict suggesting as Westing does that competition for limited ... freshwater ... leads to severe political tensions and evenwar’.7 The argument’s historical limb suggests that ‘history is replete with examples of violent conflict over water’.8 [pg. 322]
