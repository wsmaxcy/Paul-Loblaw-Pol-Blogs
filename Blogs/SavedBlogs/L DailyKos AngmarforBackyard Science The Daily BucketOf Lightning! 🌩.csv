L, The Daily Bucket:Of Lightning! ðŸŒ©, AngmarforBackyard Science, 2021-07-03,   Real time lightning strikes: lightningmaps Storm chaser Pecos Hank:Â ðŸŒ©Â   "Lightning is a symptom and a cause of climate change. A recently established task team is working to make lightning data available and useful for climate science and service applications. climate. But scientists are starting to recognize that lightning has a broader story to tell. Lightning frequency is changing as climate is changing. For example lightningâ€™s close relationship to thunderstorms and precipitation makes it a valuable indicator for storminess which makes lightning a particularly useful means of observing a variable andÂ changing climateÂ [PriceÂ 2013;Â WilliamsÂ 2005].  Whatâ€™s more lightning is not only an indicator of climate change; it also affects the global climate directly. Lightning produces nitrogen oxides which are strong greenhouse gases [Price et al.Â 1997]. In recent years measurements of lightning have become more extensive and new satellite instruments Â have further enhanced measurement coverage [Albrecht et al.Â 2016;Â Goodman et al.Â 2013;Â Yang et al.Â 2017]. However the monitoring of lightning for climate science and services is still limited on a global scale."

We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants clouds rocks watersÂ the Earth- and note lifeâ€™s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below.) The Daily Bucket is a regular feature of theÂ Backyard ScienceÂ group. Â It is a place to note any observations you have made of the world around you. Animals weather meteorites climate soil plants waters are all worthy additions to the Bucket. Â Please let us know what is going on around you in a comment. Â Include as close as is comfortable for you your location. Each note is a record that we can refer to in the future as we try to understand the patterns that are quietly unwinding around us.
