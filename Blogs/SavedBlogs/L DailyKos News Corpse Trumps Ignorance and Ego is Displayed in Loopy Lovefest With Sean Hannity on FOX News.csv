L, Trump's Ignorance and Ego is Displayed in Loopy Lovefest With Sean Hannity on FOX News, News Corpse, 2021-04-20, Three months after being banished from the White House Donald Trump has finally emerged from his Mar-a-Lago bunker for his first on-camera interview. Naturally he canoodled with his long-time love interest Sean Hannity on Fox News. Hannity was typically starry-eyed as he lavished praise on Trump as "working harder than ever" [on what?] and lobbed childish insults at President Biden. As has been the case with every other interview of Trump on Fox News there was nothing newsworthy revealed. The questions were embarrassingly ingratiating and Trump's replies were tedious regurgitations of his signature blend of whining and bragging (video below). "You're gonna have the biggest tax increase you've ever seen" Trump babbled. "Pro-life second amendment so many different things" he insisted. But apparently he could only think of two. Then he segued to this mangling of history - and reality: "I don't know if you know Sean usually in a second term a president gets less votes. I got twelve million more. It's the biggest that's ever happened in history. From 63 to 75. Never happened before." Trump's fascination with the election results is rooted in his desperate need to elevate his pitifully losing legacy. There is no truth - or coherence  - to Trump's assertion that "there was no way you lost" if you got 65 million votes. He obviously doesn't grasp that the population of the country and hence the potential vote count is constantly increasing. But even worse is his claim that no president has ever gotten more votes for a second term or that his totals were "the biggest that's ever happened in history." For the record every two-term president but one got more votes for their second term for the past half century:   Trump was not only lying about being the sole recipient of more votes for his second term he also inflated the number of additional votes from about eight million to twelve million. And of course he completely erased the fact that Biden bested him by seven million votes (81268924). Biden's enduring popularity is literally driving the right crazy. Meanwhile Trump continues to believe that he's beloved by massive majorities of imaginary Americans. He thinks that he and his "Make America Great Again" agenda is essential for victories in 2022 and 2024 despite the losses of the White House and the Senate in 2020. What he still hasn't absorbed is the reality that he lost the popular vote twice never reached 50% approval in four years was impeached twice and remains the least popular president in history. But other than that he's real winner. NOTE: Twitter recently suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
