L, WI-Gov: Bradley Whitford Helps Gov. Tony Evers (D) Keep Up The Fight To Save Our Democracy, poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-30, Received this e-mail today from Emmy Award Winning actor and Wisconsin native Bradley Whitford in support of Governor Tony Evers’ (D. WI) gubernatorial campaign:  In a recent interview about my acting roles I noted that my choices from The West Wing to The Handmaid's Tale seemed to be “tracking the death of democracy.” With the Wisconsin GOP spreading wild conspiracy theories to justify fundamentally un-American new voter suppression laws it’s sobering to think how far we have already gone down that road. Moments like this require leaders with the moral conviction and backbone to defend our values — even when it’s hard and politically costly. That’s why I’m taking the time to reach out to ask you to join me in supporting my friend Tony Evers before the first major reporting deadline of his re-election campaign. Can I count on you to pitch in? I am acutely aware that the only reason I have been able to pursue a career in acting is because after serving in the Navy in World War II my father was able to secure a mortgage and support his wife and five children through decades of a rising supported middle class. Tragically the GOP no longer believes in that version of America. Here in Wisconsin they are fighting Tony on every action he attempts to keep us safe reduce inequality and give working folks a shot at making a living — from expanding the education system to investing in critical infrastructure and much more. And with increasingly unhinged conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and non-existent “voter fraud” they hope to confuse us into a sort of “sunken place” where regular folks will no longer have any say in what happens in our government. Their vision is a Wisconsin that serves only big donors and the only way to stop it is to have Tony’s back like he has ours. With so much at stake can I count on you to donate now before Tony’s first major reporting deadline since he launched his campaign for re-election?
