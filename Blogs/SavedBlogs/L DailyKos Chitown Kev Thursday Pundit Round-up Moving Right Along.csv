L, Thursday Pundit Round-up: Moving Right Along, Chitown Kev, 2021-07-01, Good morning everyone! Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post issues a 6-month report card on the presidency of Joe Biden. But six months into the new administration the political culture and media seem not to have accepted a federal government that lacks the sort of hysteria controversy and scandal that defined the previous presidency. The tendency to overwrought drama (The infrastructure deal is in peril!) and the constant expectation of doom (The deal is on track but danger ahead!) suggest not only a desperation to attract eyeballs and clicks but also a cynicism that things cannot really have improved all that much. But they have. The government got 300 million coronavirus shots in arms. More than 2 million jobs have returned and growth is up — in significant part because of the mammoth American Rescue Plan. Biden returned from a successful overseas trip which rather than embarrassing his countrymen reassured them that a U.S. president could be respected in the world again. Overall America’s image has rebounded around the world. *** If you feel rattled and unsteady you may be consuming too much social media. Your ongoing anxiety may also be the reaction to a Republican Party that has adopted hysteria crisis manufacturing lying and scare tactics as its default. The border is in crisis! Actually the vast majority of unaccompanied minors are now processed in an orderly fashion and the administration has begun to reunite children separated from their families. Vice President Harris’s chief of staff does not allow just any old friend to talk to her! (Really this is a problem?) Children are being indoctrinated by critical race theory to hate America! (No but it is good we are learning more about our history.) John Cassidy of the New Yorker doesn’t think that President Biden has scaled back any of his plans for an “ambitious” presidency. The larger story which often gets lost in the daily news cycle is the enduring scale of Biden’s ambition. Simply put he is trying to remake American domestic policy in a way rarely seen outside wartime. Looking at the scale of his proposals to tackle climate change expand the social safety net and check rising income inequality the only comparable Democratic initiatives are the New Deal and the Great Society. Even those comparisons are a bit misleading: F.D.R. and Lyndon Johnson both enjoyed large majorities on Capitol Hill. Biden’s Democrats have a narrow nine-vote majority in the House while in the Senate he must rely on his Vice-President to break a tie. That’s if he can cajole the likes of Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema into supporting him. Pulling off this double-play is a mighty challenge but Biden seems fully committed to doing so. That’s what he was trying to say last Thursday when he got himself in trouble. Assuming that the infrastructure package makes it to a vote it will be the much smaller of the two spending bills that will dominate Capitol Hill over the next few months—and yet by normal standards it is far from small. According to a White House fact sheet the two sides have agreed on $579 billion in new spending over five years. Add in extra spending already included in the existing congressional baseline and the spending figure comes close to a trillion dollars over five years and $1.2 trillion over eight years. Most of this money will be allocated to transportation projects expanding broadband Internet access and modernizing water systems. Brian Deese Biden’s top economic adviser says that there is enough money in the agreement to replace every lead water line and pipe in the country—which would have major public-health benefits particularly in poor communities. Kurt Bardella writes for NBC News imploring House Democrats to pay little to no mind to what Republicans may do to obstruct the new House select committee investigating the 1/6 Insurrection. The illusion that Republicans could be equal and willing partners in the pursuit of justice died on the day that 147 of them voted against certifying a free and fair election just hours after the attack on the United States Capitol. For anyone suffering from an acute case of short-term memory loss Republicans then torpedoed a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate the insurrection in May. The notion of selecting one of the few Republicans who actually believe in choosing country over party to join the committee isn’t necessarily a bad one. But if that person isn’t willing to subpoena Kevin McCarthy or other fellow Republicans the appointment is worse than meaningless. Republicans are going to make their noise. They may even appoint members to the select committee who characterized the Jan. 6 attack as akin to a “normal tourist visit.” Let them. The tried and true soundbites will show up on Fox News regardless. Instead of trying to prevent the inevitable do the work. Get depositions and testimony from people we haven’t heard from yet. Get every single piece of paper that exists from the events leading up to Jan. 6 from every agency and department that was involved. Put heroes like D.C. Metro Police Officer Michael Fanone front-and-center at the panel’s first hearing and dare Republicans to deny what happened on that violent day. Simply put call the GOP’s bluff. The Editorial Board of the New York Daily News has had quite enough with the ways in which elections have been conducted in the nation’s largest city. We’ve paid close attention to the blunderers for decades. So while the rest of the known world is now slack-jawed focused on the incredible spectacle of an embarrassing and gigantic botch in America’s biggest city we react more with fury and frustration than astonishment. Yesterday statements of concern and promises of hearings from committee chairs and leaders of the state Senate and Assembly landed. They mean nothing without action. While a constitutional amendment to turn local boards from partisan hack shops into professional agencies will take years there are necessary near-term steps. The first and most pressing is that Speaker Carl Heastie and the Assembly must follow the Senate and immediately pass a bill to require local boards to publish the full ballot images and records shortly following the vote enabling all to check their work and restore confidence. This would have not been a problem until a tremendously dumb ruling by the state’s highest court sealing those records for two years after each election. It’s good that the campaigns of Eric Adams and Kathryn Garcia have filed lawsuits since the deadline to serve papers on everyone is tomorrow. What other choice did they have? That’s another law that needed changing pushing back the deadline. And don’t get us started on how Albany’s new automatic hand-count law a major reform may not fit with ranked-choice primaries. James Hohmann of the Washington Post writes a refreshing report on some of the improvements taking place in elections systems in various states. The nonpartisan Voting Rights Lab tabulates that 28 states have passed 71 laws since last November’s election to make voting easier which will benefit 63 million eligible voters while 18 states have passed 31 laws during that time to erect barriers affecting 36 million eligible voters. The group calls this “a tale of two democracies” and warns in a new report: “Increasingly one’s ZIP code determines a citizen’s ability to exercise their constitutional right to vote.” The Justice Department sued Georgia last week to block its controversial new law. Republican-controlled states such as Florida Iowa and Arizona have passed bills that will make it more difficult to vote and battles over restrictive measures continue to rage in Texas and elsewhere. On the other hand: Nevada recently joined the growing roster of states that will automatically mail ballots to active voters in future elections. Maryland created a permanent absentee voter list. Connecticut and New York are poised to amend their state constitutions so people can vote by mail without an excuse. Indiana and Kentucky both of which are red states have expanded ballot drop-off locations and made it easier to correct errors on mail-in ballots that would otherwise be invalidated. In light of the extreme heat wave in the Pacific Northwest Bob Berwyn James Bruggers and Liza Gross write for Inside Climate News on the increasing prevalence of dangers of heat waves. Life-threatening extreme heat linked with global warming has broiled parts of every continent over the last few decades killing at least 166000 people from 1998 to 2017 according to the World Health Organization. A 2020 heat wave study found that since the 1950s periods of extreme heat have become more frequent longer-lasting and hotter matching and even exceeding climate projections made 20 years ago. Research on links between heat waves and global warming suggests that several of the most recent extreme heat waves would have been all but impossible were the climate not being warmed by greenhouse gases. Based on the studies the Fourth National Climate Assessment projects that dangerous heat waves should be expected across much of the U.S. with big impacts to key economic sectors like transportation and agriculture. “Perhaps the most important thing for everyone to realize is that extreme heatwaves are becoming more frequent and hotter because of human-caused global warming”said University of Michigan climate researcher Jonathan Overpeck who moved from Arizona to the Midwest a few years ago partly based on his concerns about extreme heat and lack of water in the Southwest. “The devastating extremes associated with climate change” he said “are only going to get worse and worse until we halt the causes of global warming.” Laura Washington of the Chicago Sun-Times calls out those of us (including myself) that traffic in stereotypes of the “angry black woman” engaging in politics. Media reports and blogs pushed a storyline about angry Black women who can’t get along. There was a meme of Lightfoot and Taylor superimposed over the fiery Edvard Munch painting “The Scream.” There were jokes about Lightfoot’s suits and the way the women wear their hair. One photo-shopped image featured a wrestling referee trying to pull them apart. Commentators joked they were fighting over coleslaw and “a huge slice of Gino’s East deep dish pizza.” Black leaders don’t share monolithic views. We have valid differences. But when Black women disagree in public when they speak up they are demeaned and ridiculed with cartoonish stereotypes. We are labeled as angry vindictive domineering unstable unprofessional. Men have battled throughout the ages. During the 2016 presidential campaign Donald Trump incessantly attacked ridiculed and demeaned his opponents. He was rewarded with the White House. The men who lead in our nation’s capital — from U.S. Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer to House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy — are at rhetorical and ideological blows most every day. Conservative Republicans in Washington are still defending the violent mobs who stormed the Capitol in defense of a lost presidency. These men are viewed as warriors heroes and stand-up guys. That’s what they do. Julia Davis of the Daily Beast writes about the efforts of the Russian government to directly recruit TDF supporters. On Monday Russia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov published an op-ed that left many readers scratching their heads. “In a number of Western countries students learn at school that Jesus Christ was bisexual” Lavrov claimed. Aside from a single viral post on TikTok featuring the ramblings of a child there doesn’t seem to be any suggestion—much less any evidence—of such a curriculum actually being taught. Far from simple non sequitur Lavrov’s musings seem to be part of a larger agenda. In fact they appear to fit squarely within the strategy pursued by the Kremlin’s elaborate propaganda ecosystem. *** Russia’s approach to courting Trump supporters has proven to be quite simple: to appeal to their belief that so-called “political correctness” threatens their livelihoods and even their future. In coming up with their tactics pro-Kremlin propagandists rely quite heavily on the material pumped out by Fox News with clips featuring Tucker Carlson regularly appearing on Russia’s most popular state TV programs. Without even trying to conceal her glee about divisions in Western countries Simonyan said: “What’s happening there honestly brings me joy. For the first time in Russia’s history—at least in the last 200 years—it has a unique opportunity to become a patron of its own homegrown ideology which we couldn’t accomplish with communism.” George Packer of The Atlantic writes an appropriately fair and brutal epitaph for former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld who passed yesterday at the age of 88. Rumsfeld was the worst secretary of defense in American history. Being newly dead shouldn’t spare him this distinction. He was worse than the closest contender Robert McNamara and that is not a competition to judge lightly. McNamara’s folly was that of a whole generation of Cold Warriors who believed that Indochina was a vital front in the struggle against communism. His growing realization that the Vietnam War was an unwinnable waste made him more insightful than some of his peers; his decision to keep this realization from the American public made him an unforgivable coward. But Rumsfeld was the chief advocate of every disaster in the years after September 11. Wherever the United States government contemplated a wrong turn Rumsfeld was there first with his hard smile—squinting mocking the cautious shoving his country deeper into a hole. His fatal judgment was equaled only by his absolute self-assurance. He lacked the courage to doubt himself. He lacked the wisdom to change his mind. Rumsfeld was working in his office on the morning that a hijacked jet flew into the Pentagon. During the first minutes of terror he displayed bravery and leadership. But within a few hours he was already entertaining catastrophic ideas according to notes taken by an aide: “best info fast. Judge whether good enough [to] hit S.H. [Saddam Hussein] @ same time. Not only UBL [Osama bin Laden].” And later: “Go massive. Sweep it all up. Things related and not.” These fragments convey the whole of Rumsfeld: his decisiveness his aggression his faith in hard power his contempt for procedure. In the end it didn’t matter what the intelligence said. September 11 was a test of American will and a chance to show it. Umair Irfan of Vox has a warning that “the human element” surrounding vaccinations will be a critical factor in containing COVID-19. Even countries that have done a good job of vaccinating people are starting to hit the limits of people willing to get their shots leaving smaller groups still vulnerable to the disease. In places like the US this pattern has effectively created two distinct pandemics with vaccinated people starting to return to normal while those who are unvaccinated make up almost all new hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19. Under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines fully vaccinated Americans do not need to wear masks or maintain social distancing. But World Health Organization officials made a different recommendation on June 25 encouraging even vaccinated individuals to wear masks in the hope of preventing the spread of variants like delta. Los Angeles County officials suggested similar precautions for indoor settings on June 28 referencing the delta variant. In the coming months even as the coronavirus continues to mutate the human element — the willingness to get vaccinated adjust behavior and tolerate restrictions — will be critical in containing the disease. “As has been true for the past year and a half human behavior is far more important in shaping the course of the pandemic than any variant” wrote virologists Amy Rosenfeld and Vincent Racaniello in the New York Times. But after 16 months of restrictions many people may be reluctant to modify their routines to counter evolving risks from variants. This urge to return to normal if mismanaged could end up drawing out the pandemic further and creating opportunities for dangerous variants to make inroads. Finally this morning Nicholas Trickett of The Diplomat offers his view on the recent video summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The video conference made for decent theater. The two leaders marked the upcoming 20th anniversary of the bilateral signing of their nations’ 2001 Treaty of Friendship and ran through the traditional laundry list of thematic priorities: the extension of said treaty reaffirmation of the value of the strategic partnership boilerplate statements about the Belt and Road Initiative and Russia’s Greater Eurasia Partnership and the same about the Northern Sea Route. Nowhere however was there any public statement of a significant new policy development regarding a wide range of areas of mutual interest. Even more telling was Putin’s need to sidestep the obvious fact that the two leaders couldn’t meet in person because of the Russian state’s resounding failure in COVID-19 management and vaccine distribution. None of the agenda items that matter now was put in front of the cameras. The Russian readout of the event did however note concerns about the destabilizing effects of U.S. withdrawals from international arms control agreements. Everyone have a great day!
