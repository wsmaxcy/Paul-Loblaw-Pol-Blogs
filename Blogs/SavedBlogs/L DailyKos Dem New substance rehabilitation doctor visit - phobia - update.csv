L, New substance rehabilitation doctor visit - phobia - update, Dem, 2021-04-23, Daily Kos Friends   Hi ! I hope everyone is doing well. Those who have followed me may remember that I had a really long drive to get to my substance abuse rehabilitation doctor and that I developed a tremendous phobia and panic regarding mask wearing. I understand the science and why a mask works. I want to wear a mask. I didn’t have a problem wearing a mask until the last two months or so. I have to get a ride because my car is not working as many know. I am still working on getting a different vehicle as inexpensive a running vehicle as possible. I believe that I started unintentionally holding my breath while wearing a mask. I have asthma which is not well-controlled and that makes it worse. The previous drive was an hour and ten minutes each way easily. By the time that I got to the return trip (2 hours plus in — 1 hour + to get there an hour there an hour back) I would get so light-headed and full of panic that no matter how bad the weather was I would have to plead with the driver to allow me to walk around to try to regain control of myself. I had mental breakdowns on the last two trips.   I started at a new doctor today and it is only 25 minutes to get there. I struggled on the way there despite a great patient and kind Kossack who drove me there and another very kind Kossack who called to talk to me to distract me. Even removing my mask did not eliminate the panic. However I did make it there without having to ask the patient Kossack driving me to pull over. This new substance abuse rehabilitation doctor is a psychiatrist. As many may recall I have severe depression and it manifests itself in very bad ways. I also have serious struggles with panic. I have insomnia and severe nausea which my new psychiatrist believes are driven by my medication. My previous nurse practitioner would only spend five minutes with me and would not address any topic outside of substance abuse. My new psychiatrist wanted my entire life story. He found many issues that must be addressed. He diagnosed me with adhd which was a diagnosis I was given when I was young. He thinks that the nalaxone in my medication could cause the nausea and contribute to the insomnia along with another medication I take amitryptiline. He has been working with patients on these issues for 20 years. He said that for the vast majority of patients suboxone / buprenorphine is a lifelong medication. He said that patients with phobias and depression could count on these concerns and others worsening by a factor of ten to fifteen if the patient got off of the medication (even gradually) and these would last a minimum of three months and could last a lifetime. Because of my complex childhood and other issues he doubts that I would be the one out of a hundred who could successfully reduce to zero. He wants to set me up with an MHMR (?) that could also help me . He made it clear that they are responsive and will address any issues that the patient calls about that very day. He set up a televisit for next week. He spent two hours with me.   On the way back I did not have the panic I have been having at all. The Kossack who drove me has already had his vaccination shots and I only leave my apartment complex once a month to go to my substance abuse rehabilitation doctor.  I was unfortunately not yet able to wear a mask. However at least I did not have panic. And I do not see anybody else. I wipe down anything brought to me while wearing gloves and a mask (short time).    I had been practicing wearing a mask here at my apartment. Late last night I wore it for an hour and a half. Yet on the drive I was not able to wear the mask and I was fighting panic even on the way there. On the way back although I was unable to wear the mask I did not have panic apart from the mask.   I have not yet had my  vaccination shots. There was an opening a couple of days ago but I had a televisit and the doctor could not guarantee what time it would be since it would be in between patients who came in person. I could not miss that televisit. Besides I already got stressed enough about the upcoming trip. Therefore I had to wait until this coming week. I am going to try to get an appointment to get my first vaccination sometime this coming week if possible.  I also learned that if you swallow the medication at all even after it has dissolved then it does not really go in your system.   I found not only grammatical mistakes but also omissions in sentences which changed the entire meaning. Truly this is a result of my lack of sleep. I apologize. I fixed the ones I caught. I cannot promise that there are not others that I missed ; in fact I can almost guarantee that there are many others which I missed. I know that this has to make it trying for those kind enough to care and to read my diary and I am very sorry about this.  I fall asleep at any moment but almost never for more than an hour. The sudden falling asleep has happened several times since I posted the diary.   The most significant sentence with an omission that I corrected is this:   He said that for the vast majority of patients suboxone / buprenorphine is a lifelong medication. He said that patients with phobias and depression could count on these concerns and others worsening by a factor of ten to fifteen if the patient got off of the medication (even gradually) and these would last a minimum of three months and could last a lifetime.  Again that is the corrected sentence . This was brand new information to me that I had never heard before.   I want to be clear that I am not contradicting you. I am simply stating what my new doctor who prescribes the medication for me and who has been treating patients with this medication for the past 20 years told me. He could not have been more clear about this. He stated this repeatedly in multiple ways and at numerous times at length. He stated that this caused the medication to not be effective and that it caused nausea among other things. Even with my insomnia I can say without fear of contradiction that I did not misunderstand him.  I am not saying that he is correct. Prior to the last week or so I had not heard this before although I did wonder about it myself. I never asked about it. This time I did not bring it up either. He could be wrong. I don’t have the background needed to contradict him myself. However again it is the very first time that I have heard this (setting up the appointment I was told the same) . This is also the first time that I was told that this is a lifetime medication a medication that once you are on you never ever get off unless you are a 1 in a 100 patient. Recently I have read this online but I was never told this by my prescribers.  He is an m.d. with all that this entails but doctors differ with each other. He said that I had to avoid consuming anything other than water for at least 15 but preferably 30 minutes. I had never heard that before either. He may have a bunch of unique theories ones that are out of the mainstream. His view may be the mainstream and I simply did not ask or did not get a large enough random sample of prescribers to learn this. I can’t know. He wants me off of other medications I take and caffeine as well which strikes me as extremist. One of my medications he wants me to stop taking is amitryptiline. I tried to get off of it before myself. When I did I found myself crawling on the floor in the middle of my university library. When my ex wife tried to get off of it she crawled under the desk at the office of my then work. She wanted children as did I but I wanted to finish my doctorate first. To have children safely it was recommended she stop taking it. She did not tell me that she was doing this. In any event I have already seen that movie and it has a very bad ending and there is not a chance in hell that I will try to do that. ever. I will stop seeing him and find another doctor before I will do that because I tried it before and it didn’t work. I explained what had happened to me before and it didn’t make much of an impression but zealots are like that. I didn’t want to set up an ultimatum since he isn’t going to try to do this at first. Mormons don’t want anybody to have caffeine either. I understand the concern since I have insomnia but I don’t consume a great deal of it and less now than when I did not have the insomnia. The insomnia started when I started taking suboxone. I consume caffeine mainly for two reasons and neither one is because it is in a drink that I consume regularly: the first is that I know from painful experience what happens when you regularly consume caffeine and stop and the second is that my medication amitryptiline causes me to feel so drowsy a drugged sleepiness that is so intolerable (and yet I will wake up in an hour no matter what) that I feel I have no choice (it is not a natural feeling sleepiness — it is an awful awful feeling). I don’t consume that much caffeine. He seems to be pushing positions that I would normally associate with extremists. However he offers what some might find somewhat plausible reasons for them. The reason to eliminate amitryptiline is that it is a serotonin uptake inhibitor as is suboxone gabapentin he says is largely duplicated by suboxone caffeine he didn’t defend but I would imagine it would be due to the insomnia issues. However I have about the equivalent of one to two cups of coffee and I did that prior to the insomnia. The amitryptiline treats depression and anxiety and clearly I need that and I already tried stopping that and I won’t try that again.  The point of all of this is simply that he seems to have extremist views which are minimally plausible for some I suppose but which would make me much worse of medically if followed. I have been on suboxone (no relapses) since the end of July of 2018. Again I had not heard the no swallowing from my previous doctors who prescribed it. Once I had called about accidentally swallowing without dissolving but that is not under discussion here. Here we are discussing swallowing after the medication has dissolved but seems to still be in my mouth.  I like this doctor a lot and he seems genuinely interested in me. Some of his views seem extremist to me and / or I have had terrible consequences for following. The first sentence can be true along with the second sentence at the same time.  Bottom line: who knows ? Unless I  due to previous experience have strong reason(s) to reject what he says I will follow what he recommends. Whenever he returns to the amitryptiline and caffeine must be completely eliminated thing in earnest I will be crystal clear. Right now since he is mostly listening to me (excepts about these things) and seems to care about my well-being (extremists religious zealots can at first appear to care about you but really it is about their beliefs ...)  I will avoid conflict .
