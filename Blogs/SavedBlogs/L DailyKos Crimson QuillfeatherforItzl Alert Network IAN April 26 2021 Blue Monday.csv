This is the Itzl Alert Network.  (Itzl is the name of the dog in the picture.)   We publish a diary here every day just before midnight. This group is here for us to check in with each other to let people know we are alive and doing OK.  We have split up the publishing duties but we welcome everyone in IAN to do daily diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! If you would like to write a diary let us know in a comment. We would love it if you joined our list of writers. You can sometimes alternate with someone. New voices are always good for a group. ++++++++++++++++++ Monday: Crimson Quillfeather. Tuesday: ejoanna.  Wednesday: Pam from California. Thursday: art ah zen.  Friday: FloridaSNMOM. Saturday: OPEN.  Sunday: loggersbrat .
