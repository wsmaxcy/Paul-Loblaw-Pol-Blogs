C, Podcast: The 3WHH School’s Out Episode, Steven Hayward, 2021-05-29, This week Lucretia and I decided to take a break from our recent seminar format—in other words no schoolwork this week—and just review some of the week’s news instead. Or perhaps we should say non-news since most of the “news” items we review turn into examples of what’s wrong with journalism today. Call it “The Age of Al Hunt” in homage to Evelyn Waugh’s device about “the Age of Hooper” in Brideshead Revisited in which the increasing “sophistication” of journalists in the ordinary sense masks a near complete ignorance of history beyond the last election a total lack of philosophical depth an absence of literary imagination and a scarcity of wit. Hunt is Exhibit One this week with a lugubrious article on how “Democrats are worried” about President Biden not because of the substance of what he’s doing but because those evil Republicans are able to frustrate his big bold agenda. Like I say they call this “journalism.” From there were look over a couple of news items from the business world this week again noting that they aren’t getting the full story at all.  And then we end by observing how the rarified world of “diversity inclusion and equity” (or “DIE!” as Lucretia likes to render the acronym) reminds us of alien invasion movies.  And we get in some important whisky news and cheeky reviews just to keep current with our malts even while we’re skipping metaphysics for once. You know what to do now: settle in here or wander over to the one-room schoolhouse better known as Ricochet. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
