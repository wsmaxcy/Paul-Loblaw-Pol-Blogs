L, KosAbility: Alleviating Arthritis - Comparing Supplements, wilderness voiceforKosAbility, 2021-06-27, This week we compare efficacy of different supplements for alleviating arthritis. The results are shown in the Supplement Comparison below. If you are not interested in the details of how I arrived at this you can just skip down to it. There is a standard scale of arthritis severity known as the WOMAC index which has three subcategories: five items for pain (score range 0–20) two for stiffness (score range 0–8) and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0–68). All point measures of improvement discussed here are according to this WOMAC scale. It ought to have been a simple matter for each study to report actual WOMAC numbers and many did. However in three studies of boswellia here here and here the authors decided to normalize the three subcategories to 100 percent each thereby resulting in much bigger numbers. A systematic review of boswellia for osteoarthritis failed to adjust for this resulting in an exaggerated  measure of benefit. The review also included a study that did report actual WOMAC numbers so it was working with numbers that were not comparable. One study covered two different Boswellia products and showed they had different efficacy. In order to obtain consistent and comparable numbers I took two separate studies that investigated the same Boswellia product Aflapin converted their numbers to the standard WOMAC scale and listed that result. A study of ginger reported the average score per answer in each subcategory which is on a scale of 0-4 instead of the totals and once again this was carried over to a systematic review of ginger for osteoarthritis. Because the numbers reported in the systematic review were not in terms of the WOMAC scale I used the two largest studies - the above referenced study plus another - which comprised 80 percent of the participants covered by the systematic review. The first study reported a 3.9 point net improvement the other 4.8 points. There were two studies of hyaluronic acid one reported a 2.8 point improvement while the other reported a 11.7 point improvement. The latter study claimed only 1 point improvement in the placebo arm whereas most other studies reported about a 10 point improvement in the placebo arm. I am skeptical of this result but did include it. Even so it was not enough to push hyaluronic acid result high enough to be a winner. The curcumin meta-analysis for osteoarthritis was well behaved and had a weighted average of 22 points improvement of the test arm over the placebo arm: Study Study date Active arm Improve-ment Placebo arm Improve- ment Net Improve-ment Weight Net Improve-ment x Weight Belcaro 2010 43 8.7 34.3 0.3 10.29 Madhu 2013 28 9 19 0.39 7.41 Manahi 2014 17 4 13 0.31 4.03   Weighted average improvement WOMAC points 21.73  From last week a study of boron for rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated a net improvement of 14 points. A systematic review of glucosamine / chondroitin was done in 2018 which included about 30 studies. Weighted-average improvements of the total WOMAC index over placebo was 1.4 points: None of the glucosamine chondroitin or their combination had a significant positive effect on the total WOMAC index and its subscores A systematic review of SAM-e for osteoarthritis found no improvement over placebo on the WOMAC function subindex.  Boswellia extract OA = osteoarthritis RA = rheumatoid arthritis Net WOMAC improvement = WOMAC Total improvement of test arm less improvement of placebo arm. WOMAC total baselines ranged roughly from 40 to 80 depending upon the study. *A major contribution towards the curcumin result was a study that started from an unusually high baseline of about 80. Absent this study the curcumin result would have been similar to boswellia and boron. If you decide to try curcumin or boswellia / Aflapin please read the applicable safety information below. Boron safety was discussed last week. Phase I clinical trial of curcumin a chemopreventive agent in patients with high-risk or pre-malignant lesions: A total of 25 patients were enrolled in this study. There was no treatment-related toxicity up to 8000 mg/day. Beyond 8000 mg/day the bulky volume of the drug was unacceptable to the patients... In conclusion this study demonstrated that curcumin is not toxic to humans up to 8000 mg/day when taken by mouth for 3 months. Safety and Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Curcumin: A Component of Tumeric (Curcuma longa) A phase 1 human trial [prior reference] with 25 subjects using up to 8000 mg of curcumin per day for 3 months found no toxicity from curcumin. Five other human trials using 1125– 2500mg of curcumin per day have also found it to be safe" Dose escalation of a curcuminoid formulation.  A dose escalation study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of a single dose of standardized powder extract uniformly milled curcumin (C3 Complex™ Sabinsa Corporation). Healthy volunteers were administered escalating doses from 500 to 12000 mg...Seven of twenty-four subjects (30%) experienced only minimal toxicity that did not appear to be dose-related  Phase I clinical trial of oral curcumin Fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies consumed capsules compatible with curcumin doses between 0.45 and 3.6 g daily for up to 4 months… Curcumin was well tolerated at all of the dose levels and dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. Two types of gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by patients which were probably related to curcumin consumption. One patient consuming 0.45 g curcumin daily and one patient consuming 3.6 g curcumin daily developed diarrhea (National Cancer Institute grades 1 and 2) 1 month and 4 months into treatment respectively. In the first case diarrhea was controlled with 4 mg of loperamide hydrochloride daily. The other patient withdrew consent from the study before the cause of the diarrhea could be investigated which resolved after cessation of treatment. One patient consuming 0.9 g curcumin daily experienced nausea (National Cancer Institute toxicity grade 2) which resolved spontaneously despite continuation of treatment. Two abnormalities were detected in blood tests both possibly related to treatment: a rise in serum alkaline phosphatase level was observed in 4 patients consistent with National Cancer Institute grade 1 toxicity in 2 patients and grade 2 toxicity in 2 patients; serum lactate dehydrogenase rose to _150% of pretreatment values in 3 patients. Interactions Turmeric and Its Major Compound Curcumin on Health: Bioactive Effects and Safety Profiles Turmeric's beneficial effects are undeniable; however its consumption may interact with certain drugs and lead to several risks. For example turmeric exerts an anticoagulant activity and inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation due to its antithrombotic properties; therefore it is essential to consider this effect given the fact that it potentiates the action of antiplatelet drugs (Shah et al. 1999). Coupled with Ginkgo biloba or garlic or with an anticoagulant such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) clopidogrel (Plavix) dipyridamole (Persantine) ticlopidine (Ticlid) warfarin (Coumadine) or enoxaparin (Lovenox) turmeric can intensify its action leading to serious consequences such as hemorrhages. Moreover according to animal studies turmeric can lower the blood sugar andas a result have additive effects with oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin. Alsoas turmeric can decrease blood pressure it has additive effects if taken with antihypertensives. Lastly turmeric known for its digestive properties increases stomach acid levels. However when associated with antacids such as cimetidine (Tagamet) famotidine (Pepcid) ranitidine (Zantac) and omeprazole it can inhibit their effectiveness.  Contra-Indications Turmeric use is not recommended for individuals allergic to Zingiberaceae plants. Regarding pregnancy and breastfeeding turmeric has historically been considered safe when used as a spice. However it has already been shown to cause uterine stimulation and thus may stimulate menstruation onset. Despite the fact that curcumin intake does not affect fetal development turmeric use is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeedingand precautions should be taken due to the lack of clinical studies. In addition curcumin may stimulate gallbladder contractions and cause gallstones development. Despite the lack of human studies curcumin use is not recommended in patients with gallstones or biliary obstruction Inhibitory Effects Although several studies have shown that curcumin raises the effect of chemotherapeutic agents sometimes it might antagonize and inhibit their antitumor efficacy (Lopez-Lazaro 2008). For example curcumin combined with cyclophosphamide annulled the effect of cyclophosphamide and then inhibited the tumor size reduction in mice (Somasundaram et al. 2002). It is not clear why curcumin exhibits such contrasting activities (Sandur et al.2007a; Sandur et al. 2007b) but it has been proposed that this may be related to curcumin concentration that plays a role in switching from its antioxidant to prooxidant effect. Curcumin may also interfere with irinotecan absorption and efficacy(Johnson and Mukhtar 2007). The only safety data I was able to find on Aflapin was an animal study that found no adverse effects. LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury. Boswellia Serrata Side effects are few and largely mild and transient gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea diarrhea or constipation. In most controlled studies adverse events were no more frequent with Boswellia extracts than with placebo. Hepatotoxicity Boswellia serrata extract has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy although there have been few prospective studies in humans that have reported on its effects on laboratory test results in any detail. In small trials Boswellia extracts have appeared to be well tolerated with only minor and few adverse effects which have been similar in frequency among persons receiving placebo. Despite wide scale use as an herbal supplement Boswellia extract has not been convincingly linked to published instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Pregnancy/Lactation Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Interactions Substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP-450) 1A2 2C8 2C9 2C19 2D6 and 3A4: Upon liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis frankincense derived from B. serrata demonstrated inhibition of CYP1A2 2C8 2C9 2C19 2D6 and 3A4. Therefore caution is warranted when using B. serrata with medications that are substrates for these isoenzymes. Substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp): Data suggest that B. serrata extract and the major boswellic acids may be potent inhibitors of P-gp via modulation of transport activity at the GI level but not at the blood-brain barrier. Therefore medications that depend on P-gp transport across the GI membrane may be impacted with coadministration of B. serrata. Warfarin: According to 2 case reports coadministration of warfarin and B. serrata may increase international normalized ratio (INR) levels. The interaction may be attributed to inhibition of lipoxygenase and interference with COX-1 by B. serrata. In addition B. serrata might inhibit CYP2C19 3A4 and 2C9 which are involved in the metabolism of warfarin. Use of B. serrata in patients receiving warfarin is not recommended.
