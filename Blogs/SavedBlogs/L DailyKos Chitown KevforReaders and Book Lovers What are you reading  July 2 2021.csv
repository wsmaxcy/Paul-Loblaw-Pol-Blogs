L, What are you reading?  July 2 2021, Chitown KevforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-07-02, In WAYR? I note what I’m reading and comment...you note what you are reading and comment. Occasionally I may add a section or a link related to books… I am finished reading: Rod Serling: His Life Work and Imagination by Nicholas Parisi- Finally! This is a very serious scholarly study of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and I don’t regret having read this. However I do wish that the intellectual material mixed better with the standard biography material which does return in the last 20-30 pages. I recommend this book for a deep study of Serling’s work but only after reading a standard biography first. I still feel as if I don’t quite know all about Serling himself the man and the artist; I do know more than a bit about his art...and that may have been the point.  I am reading: Slouching Towards Bethlehem by Joan Didion- When Didion writes about places like Alcatraz or Hawaii or New York City it’s almost as if her words become a photograph...it takes a damn good writer to produce that effect. (Although sometimes one wants a little bit left to their own imagination.)  It is often said that New York is a city for only the very rich and the very poor. It is less often said that New York is also at least for those of us who came there from somewhere else a city only for the very young. I (a native Detroiter) lived in New York City in 1986-87 when I was 19. I kinda agree with Ms. Didion (writing here in the 1960’s) about New York being a city “only for the very young” as if it were a playground but I would add that no one can remain “very young” in New York for very long. See...now I’m thinking about that sentence...people that were my age at the time I lived in NYC seemed ancient to me. How Long ‘Til Black Future Month by N.K.
