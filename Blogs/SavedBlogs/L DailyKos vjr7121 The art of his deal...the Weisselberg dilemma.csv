L, The art of his deal...the Weisselberg dilemma, vjr7121, 2021-07-02, We are listening to the sound of one shoe dropping.  The man who once boasted that not paying taxes made him “smart” is now hoping his crooked CFO remains loyal.  In a game of “chicken” both men know the other’s vulnerabilities because they both share the same secret---they are two sides of the same coin. While Allen Weisselberg works behind the scenes juggling their illegal sets of books Trump provides the shiny objects that hide their sleazy business model.  In a world of smoke and mirrors where phony branding is raised to an art the steaks and college and casinos and the “non-profit” foundation the truth is illuminating. The Fall of the House of Trump is seemingly in its opening chapters as prosecutors for the Manhattan DA’s Office brought charges against the Trump Organization and its CFO. The prosecutors focused on fifteen charges that were approved by a longstanding grand jury that continues its work even as the initial cases are brought.  To be sure Weisselberg is the prize here for the moment.  He faces a series of charges that suggest that for 50 years beginning with his work with Fred Trump and continuing on with his son Weisselberg was cooking the books.  While it is no surprise that the Trumps are guilty of cheating the IRS and helping others cheat the taxman one wonders what else lurks within the organization that has a storied history of questionable business practices.  It would be naive not to listen for the sound of another shoe dropping. The current case against the organization and Weisselberg has all the markings of a skillfully crafted “whodunnit” written like one of those old Columbo series plots.  The audience saw the crime committed in the opening credits and watched as the scruffy but persistent Lt. Columbo wore down his prey.  Columbo always seemed to be sitting with the audience because he settled on the killer like a laser from the start.  So it seems are these prosecutors.   Mr. Weisselberg is the smaller of the fish they are after and more likely collateral damage in the coming storm about to hit the Trump crime family. The unsealed charges included references to others involved in the scheme carried out by the Trump CFO.  No one believes that Weisselberg could have done what he is accused of doing without Donald Trump’s knowledge and direction.  While Weisselberg has chosen to be loyal to his boss like a Columbo episode everyone watching knows that this is a futile stance. Loyalty is a cheap commodity in Trump-World and Allen knows it.  So do the prosecutors.  They have laid a trap that Trump’s former CFO willingly walked into.  As sure as Columbo’s trench coat is peppered with cigar burns and coffee stains the prosecutors had to know that flipping Weisselberg would be difficult.  Trump has bought his silence with years of mutual cooperation and clever grooming.  Trump has been preparing for this day his entire life.  And so the prosecution team set up their mark and have him ensnared with this arraignment.   In the unsealed charges there are hints that must bring shivers to Allen.  There is a strong suggestion that one of the other persons mentioned in the indictment who had benefitted from his scheme is a Trump—but not that Trump!  If you remembered the New York Times expose last fall after the newspaper had gained access to ten years of the former president’s taxes you will recall that Ivanka was identified as having received a large “consulting fee” even though she is an officer in the company and receives an annual compensation. This would implicate her in the scheme to defraud by allowing the Trump Org. to write off her compensation as a business expense.  It would also allow the favored daughter to write off part of her own compensation as a business expense to her consultancy.   Weisselberg knows the whole story and must be aware of its implications.  He is now betting that Donald will choose to stand by as his daughter is placed in jeopardy and remain loyal to him. Ah here is the part where Columbo turns and says “Just one more thing...”  After offering Weisselberg an opportunity to get off cheap by turning on his boss the DA’s Office included just one more thing for him to consider. Weisselberg faces a choice: trust that Donald Trump will stick to the plan and place his daughter in jeopardy... or flip. The prosecutors have taken away Weisselberg’s leverage by naming “other Trump executives” in their indictment.  Does the CFO believe that the Trump family will take care of his interests if he takes the fall if their own interests are lost?  If Weisselberg senses that the Trumps are left with a choice between one of their own and him what are his chances? It is far more likely that Trump tries to blame it all on the bookkeeper and that his lawyers try to sell a theory that they are the victims here---that they were relying on Weisselberg’s opinions and direction.  Trump’s legal acumen has been tested over the past few years and has shown itself to be rather weak.  He can lose a court case with the best of lawyers---or the worst.  Now without the cover of the presidency it would take Clarence Darrow and a legal pandemic to win this one. But is Weisselberg willing to risk that the prosecutors know and can prove far more than he thought? Weisselberg may come to realize that he and Trump share the same canoe and one of them will be forced to throw the other into the drink. Just one more thing.  As Weisselberg considers whether he will be willing to take the fall for Ivanka or for Donald he now must factor in that these prosecutors may have enough evidence against them all.  After hearing the charges today Allen Weisselberg likely soiled his Depends as he realized that there are no bargains with the devil. Does he believe that his pledge of loyalty to Trump who abandoned his own brother who had stolen from his addled father and denied his brother’s family of their inheritance will survive ---that Donald thinks more highly of him.? The guy who cheated on all three of his wives?  That guy?  Loyalty is not a word in Trump's limited vocabulary. It is what he scrapes from the bottom of his tasseled golf slippers after a turn on his goose-laden golf property.  Allen Weisselberg on the other hand might be coming to the conclusion that there are two men in this sinking boat and there is only room for one. Maybe a deal with the Manhattan DA is still possible. At 74 it may get him a little less time and a fine.  He might even if he divulges enough get off with a large bill from the IRS and a scathing lecture from a judge. In any case the art of his deal is that he can offer up a prize worth the bargain. Trump on the other hand can offer only him.
