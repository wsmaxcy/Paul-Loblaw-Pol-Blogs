L, UPDATE: Sara R cancer surgery, Angela Marx, 2021-04-20, I am in a Happy Place today because our Sara R had her surgery yesterday and today is still in ICU recovery but there is GOOD NEWS! From winglion (Ann):  Sara’s surgery went well. The surgeons spoke with me afterwards on the phone and they were happy with the results and felt they got good margins on the mass that was removed.  Sara did have to have a tracheotomy so she won’t be speaking anytime soon but we got a whiteboard and pens so she will be able to communicate while she heals.  They expect her to remain in ICU recovery another day or possibly two while they wait and watch for the grafted skin they took from her upper arm to cover the surgical site on the inside of her mouth to bond and heal.  Of course Ann isn’t allowed inside the hospital (COVID is still the prime driver in hospital settings) but she keeping in close touch with Sara’s nursing staff and will do an update to the Pootie folk later today (after her Vaccine induced napping is over).  I will update all of you later this week or when there is any more news.  To everyone who sent a message on the quilt thank you.  To everyone who sent the ladies a few quatloos to help them while they can’t work on quilts or Pootie Pads thank you.  To everyone who is and has been sending them both Good Thoughts and healing vibrations thank you thank you thank you!   ❤️❤️❤️ angie   per a request here is an image from the Quilt that is still under construction for Sara R. I’ll do a full image if I can get one from whomever is working on it today.  The full message from Zen Trainer is:  What do you mean I’m hugging you too tight Sara there is no such thing!  Love Tracy  below that of course is Daisy from the Animal Nuz crew by our friend ericlewis0 who transcribed your messages onto the front of the quilt for Sara R The entire quilt face side up thanks to our friend 2thanks — UPDATED with the finished quilt courtesy Beadlady:     My super thanks to Beadlady ericlewis0 and maggiejean (who is doing the binding work).  This could never have happened without your selfless contributions.  ❤️ 💙 💚 💛 💜 angie   UPDATE: 10:34 pm PST from winglion (Ann) Hi jumping in here.
