L, Photo Diary: Gatorland, Lenny FlankforShutterbugs, 2021-07-01, Greetings from Orlando FL. I'm here for a week or two to check out all my systems (my van has basically been sitting idle for the pandemic) and also because I like Orlando dammit. ;) For those who don't know I live in a converted campervan and travel around the country posting photo diaries of places that I visit.  :) I can already see that some of the things that used to be routine for me are gonna be different now at least for a while. There are no 24-hour Walmarts anymore (and my favorite one here is now listed as "no overnighting" damn). For some reason that baffles me all the malls and big box stores here seem to have closed their water fountains which is kind of a PITA. And I've already run into places I want to see that did not survive the pandemic and are now closed either permanently or "temporarily". Anyway the plan right now is to stay in Orlando for a bit then head over to Montgomery AL for a while. I'll likely stay in AL MS and LA for a few months then head back to FL for the winter. But dammmmmnnnnn it sure is nice to be traveling again. :) So some photos from a visit to Gatorland.
