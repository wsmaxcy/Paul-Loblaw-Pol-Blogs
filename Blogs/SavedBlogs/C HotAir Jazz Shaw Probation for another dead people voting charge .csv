C, Probation for another "dead people voting" charge , Jazz Shaw, 2021-05-04, Here’s a riddle for our readership to consider. What does it take for the mainstream media to be willing to actually talk openly about real cases of voter fraud? The answer is… when it’s a Republican that does it. While nobody was allowed to publicly discuss voter fraud in the 2020 elections until Joe Biden was safely in office without being accused of undermining democracy or whatever the topic is now apparently back in play. That may have been part of the reason that CNN was willing to run an article about a guy in Pennsylvania who pleaded guilty to casting a vote for Donald Trump in the name of his dead mother last November. And for that crime he was given five years… of probation. A Pennsylvania man has been sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to casting a vote in the name of his deceased mother in an effort to reelect then-President Donald Trump according to court records and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer’s office. Bruce Bartman 70 received the sentence Friday after entering a guilty plea to two counts of perjury and one count of unlawful voting. Bartman will also lose his right to vote for four years pursuant to Pennsylvania statute the district attorney’s office said in a news release. Voter records show that Bartman used Pennsylvania’s online voter-registration portal to register both his late mother Elizabeth Bartman and his deceased mother-in-law Elizabeth Weihman who died in 2019 — illegally registering both as Republican voters the district attorney’s office said. So Mr. Bartman actually registered two dead people to vote his mother and his mother-in-law. But he only cast a vote in the name of his mother… that we know of. If the guy had a clean criminal record up until then I suppose you could understand him getting off with probation. He also took full responsibility for his actions in court without trying to weasel out of it and that can go a long way with a judge sometimes. Of course this was far from the only incident of dead people voting in the 2020 elections. In the race for New York’s 22nd District seat (which was finally decided by barely 100 votes) there are charges pending in three cases of the dead rising from the grave to vote. There were several more identified on Long Island. And since we can’t stress this enough I will repeat it yet again. These are just the people we managed to catch. “The system” didn’t catch these acts of voter fraud through any automated systemic process.  They were all tagged in one of two ways. The GOP had election monitors watching several races in New York and doing online searches of the names of people who allegedly sent in ballots. They were the ones who identified some of the “voters” as having shuffled off this mortal coil. In other instances someone showed up to drop off a ballot in person and a poll worker turned out to know the real person and was aware that they were dead. But how many were missed? We may never know. My major concern stemming from this case is that if anyone else is considering doing the same thing in two or four years what sort of message will they take away? If you’re really desperate enough to try to steal an election five years of probation might not seem like too high of a price to pay.
