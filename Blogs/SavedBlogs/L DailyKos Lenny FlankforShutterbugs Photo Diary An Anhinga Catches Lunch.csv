L, Photo Diary: An Anhinga Catches Lunch, Lenny FlankforShutterbugs, 2021-05-09, During one of my daily walks recently I happened to spot this Anhinga fishing for his lunch at Sawgrass Lake Nature Preserve in St Pete FL. For those who don't know I lived in a converted campervan and traveled around the country posting photo diaries of places that I visited. But the pandemic has clipped my wings and I am now holed up in Florida until I can begin traveling again. :)           :)
