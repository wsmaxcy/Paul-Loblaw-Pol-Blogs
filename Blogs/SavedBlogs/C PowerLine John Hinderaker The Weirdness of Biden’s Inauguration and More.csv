C, The Weirdness of Biden’s Inauguration and More, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-30, My favorite media appearances these days are on Australian television. Sky News has several excellent hosts one of whom is Rowan Dean. I was on the air with Rowan Tuesday night talking about Joe Biden’s inauguration leaks from the White House about Biden’s mental capacity the new administration’s blizzard of executive orders and the Democrats’ second impeachment of Donald Trump. The segment is just six minutes long but contains plenty that is of interest I think:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
