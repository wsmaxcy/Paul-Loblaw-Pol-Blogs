L, A Brief Opine About Liz Cheney Never Trumpers and the Unenviable Position They're In, zircon the twisted, 2021-05-09, I don't like Liz Cheney. I disagree with her down the line and many here rightly point to how bad she is and has been. That said if you truly see Trump and Trumpism as an existential threat to democracy (and I do) you have to see her as an ally. Not a hero but an ally. An untrustworthy ally to be sure an ally to be dropped like a hot rock if the stain of fascism that is today's GQP is beaten back no question. But it's not beaten back. It is strong and seems to be getting stronger. Therefore I have no choice but cheer her on.  Ultimately though she Kinzinger Romney Sasse Flake . . . have to learn a very important lesson which is that any victory for Trump/Trumpists makes Trumpists stronger. They can't pick and choose. Even if the Trumpists pursue policies they agree with they can't let the Trumpists win. The survival of the Republic is more important than any one issue or even group of issues. This means the Never Trumpers in the GQP have to be willing to lose not just to Trumpists but to democrats. Democrats may support a number of things they can't stomach but democrats don't threaten the Republic.  If they can bring themselves to vote and campaign for democrats great. If they can’t and that means starting a third party that garners say 15%-20% of the vote a 15%-20% that gives democrats victories in unlikely places so be it. They’ll need to try to sell their policies as vastly different from those of democrats and they’ll need to try to sell their anti-fascist vison that is vastly different from those of Trumpists. Whether they like it or not that's probably not a winning combination but it's a base position from which they can start and from which they can seek to convince voters.  Unfortunately for them I don't think it's a winning position for them in the short or medium term and probably not one in the long term. Unfortunately for the country I think they will see that unlikely chance at victory and reject it opting instead to fight within the GQP a fight they are almost certain to lose and a fight that despite their professed concern for the Republic endangers it. In short unlikely ally though she may be she and those like her need to do more to divorce themselves from Trump and Trumpists. If they don’t the Republic they claim to revere is on the precipice.
