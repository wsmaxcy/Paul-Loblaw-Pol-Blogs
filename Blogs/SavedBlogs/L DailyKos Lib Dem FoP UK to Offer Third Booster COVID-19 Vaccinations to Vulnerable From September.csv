L, UK to Offer Third "Booster" COVID-19 Vaccinations to Vulnerable From September, Lib Dem FoP, 2021-06-30, The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has asked NHS leaders to prepare to offer third booster vaccinations to the vulnerable from September in association with the annual flu vaccination. The criteria will be the same for those eligible for free ann.ual flu vaccinations The rollout will prioritise the most at risk first in a similar way to the COVID 19 vaccinations. After those groups it will be: People in younger age groups will only have received their second dose of the COVID vaccination in July or August so advice over booster doses for them will be considered later. There are clinical trials to decide which vaccines should be offered for this third dose however the flu vaccinations are principally given in GP or pharmacy settings. This may limit which vaccines can be administered due to the storage needs. GP surgeries are also often not set up to provide the space needed to monitor numbers of patients post-injection. Many medical authorities are wary of a significant influenze season this year. The last two in the northern hemisphere have been very mild with virtually no influenza hospitalisations. Relaxation of masking and other measures is expected to result in an increase in respiratory infections. This is of concern as the early symptoms of infection by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 have changed to resemble a cold. Hopefully the booster shots will be produced by the new non-profit Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre which should be fully open soon. It has facilities to produce mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines at scale.
