L, EGO MANIAC Trump Calls TV Ratings Declines 'A Wonderful Thing to See' / UPDATE: FOX News Joins In, News Corpse, 2021-06-29, Donald Trump the former reality TV game show host is once again obsessing over television ratings. It's almost as if he still thinks he's a TV personality rather than the pathetic political loser who is now a senior resident of Palm Beach's gaudy Mar-All-Ego retirement village in Florida. Trump's fixation on TV ratings goes back a long ways. He has long regarded them as being a better indicator of popularity than public opinion polls. That may be because most polls consistently exposed his weakness and general disapproval with the public at large. Trump literally said that TV ratings "are the real polls" despite the fact that Nielsen doesn't measure popularity just viewership. Which means they don't record the political ideology of viewers. Furthermore TV ratings don't account for the fact that Fox News only tops the ratings because it has a de facto monopoly on the cult-like right-wing audience while the rest of the viewer universe is divided among all the other news and entertainment networks. On Tuesday Trump issued one of his increasingly impotent statements (since he can no longer post on social media) that are mostly ignored by everyone but his dimwitted disciples. He said that...  Statement by Donald J. Trump 45th President of the United States of America pic.twitter.com/6RxB5Sfz9Y  Trump is surprisingly correct for once. Ratings for all of the cable news networks have declined year over year. According to Deadline... However Trump doesn't bother to explain why ratings have suffered. He simply implies that it's because his unceasing lunacy is no longer a part of the daily circus that consumes the press. He's at least partially correct. There are fewer viewers for the same reason that viewership declines after any other catastrophic event. Ratings spike when a hurricane ravages the eastern shore. Then they subside when the weather returns to normal. And Hurricane Trump has petered out. In the big picture the ratings for all of the cable news networks were expected to fall back from this time last year. In June of 2020 the nation was in the midst of a presidential election. The party conventions were approaching. And it isn't insignificant to note that people were confined to their homes due to a deadly pandemic. Which was another Trump catastrophe that boosted news viewing. Trump's statement went out of its way to identify program hosts mostly from MSNBC. And the only one that he derisively insulted was Joy Reid a Black woman. That's a pretty good indicator of who and what he is most afraid of. But his last comment stating that these ratings declines are "A wonderful thing to see" reveals his hostility to the media that he has repeatedly referred to in Stalinist terms as "the enemy of the people." Like the totalitarian dictators he admires Trump wants the media to fail. He regards a free press and the Constitution that protects it as an adversary. And any bad news for the media is good news for an aspiring tyrant like Trump. He actually confided his envy to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin telling him that he also would like to "get rid of" the press. And given the opportunity don't doubt that he wouldn't try. UPDATE: Fox News reported on the ratings decline of CNN and MSNBC attributing it without evidence to a "credibility problem." And speaking of credibility problems for some reason Fox's article never mentioned Fox News ratings at all or that they had declines that were just as bad and more often than not worse. Hmm...
