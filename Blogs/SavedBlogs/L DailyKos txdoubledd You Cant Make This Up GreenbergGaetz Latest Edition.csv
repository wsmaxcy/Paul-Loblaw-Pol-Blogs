L, You Can't Make This Up Greenberg/Gaetz Latest Edition, txdoubledd, 2021-04-29, I do not have a subscription to the Daily Beast so I can't quote anything from the article. Chris Cuomo however just had the author on his show and I am sure some other sites must have the particulars.  The plot is just unbelievably stupid that said the Daily Beast claims they have a copy of the letter.  Greenberg decided that he needed a pardon and who does he turn to for help none other than Roger Stone. It is unclear if he paid him or just thought he was his best chance with dt.  Roger Stone who is a truly evil man decides that the best way to help Greenberg if for Greenberg to hand write what was basically a letter confessing to his crimes for dt to consider in pardoning him.  In the letter Greenberg admits to having sex for money and other items and in particular he decides to include the sex both he and Congressman Gaetz had with a 17 year old girl.  Fast forward and the Daily Beast obtains a copy and gets a hand writing expert to analyze the letter and compare it to publicly available documents which allegedly confirms it is his hand writing. The Daily Beast author claims the letter is very specific and incriminating.  Of course Gaetz has denied ever trying to get a pardon or having sex with a minor and continued that claim tonight through his media handlers. Greenberg's lawyer said he can't comment due to attorney-client privilege. Greenberg was already under indictment from last summer and was out on bail.  Of course Greenberg didn't get the pardon and it is unclear from watching the Cuomo interview if Stone ever attempted to get him a pardon because of course Stone denies all involvement and claims he doesn't remember any letter.  Why would Greenberg include Gaetz in his letter? My answer of course is that he wanted dt to pardon him and thought it would be helpful if dt thought Gaetz might be in trouble. Of course the other choice is because it was true. Greenberg allegedly claimed he was present when Gaetz had sex with the 17 year old. Moral of the story if you are in trouble do not seek or take advice from Roger Stone and no matter what you do do not make a hand written confession. I swear you just can't make this stuff up.
