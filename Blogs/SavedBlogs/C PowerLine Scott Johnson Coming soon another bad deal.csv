C, Coming soon another bad deal, Scott Johnson, 2021-01-25, The Biden administration is determined to reenter the nuclear deal with Iran (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) in some form. See for example the Jerusalem Post/Reuters story “US already in Iran deal talks officials met in New York – report.” It’s a critical component of the great undoing in which Biden and his cast of retreads are engaged to set us back to where we were when Barack Obama left office and as it wrenches us ever further to the dystopian left. The JCPOA was so monumentally bad for the United States that I drew one inference from it: President Obama supported Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. He supported it to such an extent that he facilitated the regime’s funding of the nuclear project. Obama carried on a one-sided love affair with the mullahs while they continued their campaigns against the United States and Israel. He could not be deterred. Contrary to my inference Hudson Institute fellow Michael Doran set the JCPOA in the context of “Obama’s secret Iran strategy” (published at Mosaic in February 2015). Doran made a strong argument but I stand by my inference. You be the judge. Everything that we have learned since the JCPOA was promulgated belies its advertised purport. Michael Oren and Yossi Klein Halevi make this out in their current Atlantic essay “The case against the Iran deal.” Oren and Halevi draw in compelling fashion on developments since 2015. (Oren’s memoir Ally provides an invaluable account of the story up to that point.) My point here and I do have one is to urge readers to take up the Oren/Halevi essay. It is a potent warning against coming attractions.  UPDATE: I assess that Doran and I are thinking along parallel lines. Those who seek to strengthen the Islamic Republic are selling there position as “support for diplomacy.” https://t.co/RtTLNNKJNk — Mike (@Doranimated) January 25 2021   Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
