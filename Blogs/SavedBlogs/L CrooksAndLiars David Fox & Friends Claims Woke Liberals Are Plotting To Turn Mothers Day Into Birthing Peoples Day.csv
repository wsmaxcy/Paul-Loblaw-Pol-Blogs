L, Fox & Friends Claims 'Woke' Liberals Are Plotting To Turn Mother's Day Into 'Birthing People's Day', David, 2021-05-09, 	The hosts of Fox & Friends expressed concern on Sunday that liberals are plotting to turn Mother's Day into "Birthing People's Day." 	"If you're a lefty it might be happy Birthing People's Day" Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth announced. "Seriously! This is Democrats -- the new phrase they want to use is you're not a mother. Nope! Done! You're a birthing person." 	Hegseth pointed to a House committee hearing wherethe phrase "birthing people" was used on at least two occasions. However the terms "mothers" and "moms" were also used. 	Co-host Jedidiah Bila echoed the remarks of Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) who lashed out at "woke" liberals over the phrase. 	"I could not agree more" Bila said. "Let me tell you something. I birthed a baby. I am a mom. I am proud of myself. I am always astonished at my body. I'm like you know what? We're super heroes. We women are super heroes for being able to do that. I want proper credit." 	Hegseth recalled that he had once tried to experience the pain of childbirth during aFox & Friends segment in 2019. 	"Thank God for women" co-host Lawrence Jones said. "God designed them to give birth because whew I can do a lot of things. I don't think that's for me." 	"Yep" Bila agreed. "We have a higher pain tolerance. And I did it without drugs." 	"But I'm officially a birthing person" Hegseth noted. "Next time someone tells you that tell them you're insane! They are moms and they give birth." For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
