L, Top Comments:  May Day Thoughts, gizmo59forTop Comments, 2021-05-01, Today is traditionally May Day or Beltane the cross-quarter day that falls between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice celebrated as a pagan holiday.  Were we European pagans we may have spent the day getting drunk and um “making friends” in the fields in order to assure a plentiful harvest in the fall.  Nowadays at best celebration of the pagan holiday is reduced to Maypole dances in 6th grade if that. On the other hand I do have friends who take their pagan holidays more seriously than most.  No they don’t “make friends” in the fields but under normal circumstances (suspended during the pandemic) they host a gathering for friends that does feature a Maypole dance and an appreciation of the return of warm weather.  Here in the north where winter takes its time moving on it’s a relief to welcome the summer.  (For the record our back deck had frost on it this morning.) The photo above is one I took today of four azaleas we planted at the back of our backyard just at the border where the woods begin in earnest.  The idea was to put something that would provide a colorful spring backdrop in the backyard.  After years the shrubs have finally come into their own but that’s only because they are behind fences protected from the marauding deer which otherwise would have eaten them to the ground.  (They’ve done that with other shrubs we’ve planted in the back.)  In any case these four azaleas are now blooming apparently undamaged by last night’s frost or last week’s snow. By this time next year this property will belong to someone else so this is the last time we’ll see these azaleas blooming.  The seasonal rhythms of southern California where we will be moving to are very different from here.  They don’t quite align with the European pagan traditions.  Given that San Diego County saw 100 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday warm weather there has already returned with a vengeance. Two days ago I received my second shot of the Moderna vaccine.  Yesterday I gave the last lectures of my academic career.  I’ve been in school either as student or instructor since 1964.  If I find myself short on money I imagine I could become an adjunct instructor at some local college or university but the fact is I feel like I’ve run out of gas and it’s time to leave that task to someone who has more energy and imagination.  I’m hoping this will be the time when my other interests will have the time and space to bloom.

From Pariah Dog: In Aldous J Pennyfarthing's diary about the continuing embarrassment of Former Guy's public commentary somehow the comments devolved into a comparison of old stuff people just can't throw away (it started out with hinges).  pasadena beggar's wry memory about his father's collection was lol funny. Mostly because I've known someone like that. From Kluger2: Aldous J Pennyfarthing wrote this diary about the former guy reduced to reliving his glory days onstage.  OregonOak started off a comment thread on surplus hardware that might come in handy.  Someday my hardware collection will be donated to a Habitat for Humanity ReStore -- but not yet !!
