L, Dem Needs Our Help, IslandMama, 2021-05-11, I think most of you know Dem and his bestfriend The Mighty Little Fluffy The Great. A couple of months ago he posted a diary about the extreme anxiety and distress he suffered while struggling through his monthly three hour round trip to his medical appointments. He also mentioned that the Kos friend he usually texted for support was unavailable to help due to family issues. After reading that diary I reached out to offer my friendship and I am happy to say he accepted my offer. We have been communicating with each other daily and I feel privileged to call this sensitive kind intelligent man my friend.  Unfortunately his daily struggles with anxiety and his difficulty with the travel required to access needed care continue. I have witnessed the huge effort he puts forth daily as he works to overcome the many obstacles standing between him and the health care he needs. He has found a new doctor who is closer to his home which will make keeping his appointments easier. And just as important is how much it will lessen the stress and anxiety he suffers during these extremely long drives. But changing doctors has brought even more expenses to his limited budget. Instead of paying cash for one appointment he will be paying for two bi-monthly appointment at $175 each while having a video-appointment weekly. He also has to pay for transportation to the two monthly appointments which usually costs him $120 a trip. Temporarily a kind Kossack who lives 40+ miles away is driving him for free when he is able. However he is not always able to help and due to the inconvenience this can only be a temporary solution. At that point he will have to return to paying for every ride and errand. In addition he pays cash for his medication which is now being prescribed weekly instead of monthly adding another $200. All of this adds up quickly and means using more of the already limited funds usually set aside for food for him and The Mighty Little Miss Fluffy. All of this is in addition to normal living cost and paying a worker $40 several times a month to deliver his online food and medicinal orders from the main lodge where all packages sent to him are delivered. These rising costs alone are overwhelming but his chronic anxiety and depression make it even more difficult for him.  What he needs most to keep going is a working vehicle. Both to fully access the care he needs and to stop paying for rides and deliveries he can not afford. I am a widow living on Social Security Disability and taking care of my 85 year old mother so I can not offer to match funds as I have seen others do. If I could I would because there is no doubt in my mind that he needs and deserves better health care and nutrition than he can currently access. But if you can help to raise the $2000 he needs to buy a cheap but hopefully dependable used car I know it will make a profound difference in his life. It will open up his ability to take control of his physical and mental health care allow him money for important needs and help him to get where he needs to be so that he can earn money and have a happier and healthier life. I want to stress that this diary is my idea. He did not ask for me to write this and while I did get his permission to address issues I know he is dealing with he has never asked me for anything but advice and friendship. If any of you can afford to give I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Even a small donation will be greatly appreciated. This is something that can truly be life changing for a man of integrity and intelligence who through no fault of his own is struggling to deal with physical mental and financial crisis's at the same time.
