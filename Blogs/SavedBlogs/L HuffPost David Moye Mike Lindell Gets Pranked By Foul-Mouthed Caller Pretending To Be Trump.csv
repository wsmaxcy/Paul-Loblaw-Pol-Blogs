L, Mike Lindell Gets Pranked By Foul-Mouthed Caller Pretending To Be Trump, David Moye, 2021-04-19, To be totally frank MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has had some problems launching his social network Frank ― including being pranked by Donald Trump impersonators. The website launch has been notoriously glitchy according to Newsweek with lots of crashes and people unable to get to the home page.  That hasn’t stopped Lindell from hosting what is being billed as a 48-hour “FRANK-a-thon” and it hasn’t stopped him from getting trolled according to Salon’s Zachary Petrizzo. Things are only getting worse for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell as he attempts to hold a 48 hours "FRANK-a-thon" event - as he is now being trolled by callers who apparently got ahold of his phone number. pic.twitter.com/IxHdXGVGMR One caller got through by claiming to be Trump ― a very foul-mouthed Trump. “Hello everyone” the fake Trump said. Lindell who bent his body over the speaker where the voice was emanating got excited. “Aw we have the president here ― our real president everyone” Lindell exclaimed. “Hello Mr. President!” Sadly for Lindell the person claiming to be the president didn’t respond in kind. “MacronShow.com bitches! MacronShow.com!” Mike Lindell was just duped into thinking Trump was calling into the program. pic.twitter.com/VUMy1etNA3 Ron Blackman who tweets as @JamesWinder and who hosts the British podcast “The Macron Show” later took credit on Twitter for the prank call and told HuffPost that Lindell deserves whatever he gets. “He’s totally asking for it spreading constant lies about vaccines and voter fraud” Winder said. “He’s a narcissist and a fraudster spreading poisonous information to people. I feel I’m doing a duty by wasting his time and embarrassing him.” Lindell is facing a $1.3 billion lawsuit over spreading falsehoods about election security in 2020. The prank call may have been short but many Twitter users found it very satisfying. God I love the internet. https://t.co/oXCtINjUao we should tax rich people more since they have money to waste on things like this https://t.co/QSmAhC8yPO MyPrankCall https://t.co/4hr4brE5YH Whoops. https://t.co/0Qah5mS0xL Stick to pillows man https://t.co/IshkGxse1C
