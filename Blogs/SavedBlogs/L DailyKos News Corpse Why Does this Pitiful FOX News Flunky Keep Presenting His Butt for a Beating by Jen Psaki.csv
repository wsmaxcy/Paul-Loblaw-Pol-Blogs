L, Why Does this Pitiful FOX News Flunky Keep Presenting His Butt for a Beating by Jen Psaki?, News Corpse, 2021-06-30, The rotten apple doesn't fall far from the diseased tree. And Peter Doocy son of long time Fox and Friends co-host Steve Doocy is one of the best examples of that old saying. The younger Doocy has been making a name for himself by engaging in embarrassing dialogues with White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Doocy recently got creamed by Psaki when he tried to make an issue of Olympic hopeful Gwenn Berry protesting social injustice. He did it again when he criticized Vice-President Kamala Harris for going to the border after months of complaining that she hadn't. And then there was the time he sought to turn the origins of the COVID virus into a contrived melodrama. On Wednesday Doocy took another shot at it. This time he was revisiting a subject on which he had previously failed to make a dent. He couldn't get a rise out of Psaki on Tuesday so he went home and retooled his queries (maybe daddy helped him) and came back for another swing on defunding the police. After rattling off the names of the Democratic "Squad" (all progressive women of color) as proponents of defunding Doocy entered into this exchange with Psaki:  Psaki: Again I think actions speak louder than words Peter… pic.twitter.com/m36LSwYZ4f  For a little background Republicans voted en mass against a Democratic bill that had $350 billion dollars of funding for law enforcement. Some of them did say that they objected to the bill for other reasons. But none of them spoke out in support of the funding or offered an alternate amendment or bill to restore it. So while some Democrats have talked about defunding the police (by which they mean reallocating funds to other services - such as mental health domestic disturbances etc. - that police shouldn't be doing anyway) Republicans have actually voted against the funding. What Doocy is attempting here is to inoculate Republicans from any accountability for their unambiguous opposition to funding for law enforcement by actually voting against it. Doocy thinks that because they didn't utter the phrase "defund the police" that their vote to literally defund the police doesn't count. Doocy went at this several times but Psaki wasn't letting him get away with it. And while Republicans are whining petulantly it was brilliant how Psaki turned the "defund the police" meme back on the GOP. You would think that Doocy would get tired of being wrecked in public over and over again. But either he has a steel spine or his objective is simply to plant his false narratives and get out of the way so Fox News viewers can lap them up. Either way he's failing to make any progress with anything but his own humiliation. And on that score he's been wildly successful.
