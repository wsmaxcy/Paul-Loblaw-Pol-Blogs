C, Former Obama Admin Official Confirms That Election Fraud in Georgia is Possible, Wrongthink Radio, 2020-11-06, In a previous post from today I mentioned how the Democrats have no right to complain about anything in regards to Donald Trump challenging the results of the election after four years of their obsessive attempts to undermine the results of the 2016 election. No more than a few minutes after publishing that piece I see a tweet where Ben Rhodes continues the conspiracy that Stacy Abrams was the winner of the Georgia gubernatorial race which might I remind you they have never provided evidence of this suppression never took legal action never got censored on social media for the claim nor were called a “threat to Democracy” for saying so. Stacey Abrams should have been Governor but for voter suppression. A lot of people would have been turned off politics. Instead she went back to work and here we are. — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) November 6 2020  Since Ben Rhodes has so graciously decided this was the line to take I suggest we all remind him that he just confirmed that election fraud is possible and therefore challenging the results of the 2020 election is not only appropriate it is our patriotic duty. There is a reason why Stacy Abrams never took her case to court and a reason why Trump is confident enough to do the opposite.
