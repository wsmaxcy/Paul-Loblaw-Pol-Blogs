L, My Cathartic Escape From Covid, wildstyle2, 2021-05-05, I dealt with Covid by creating music. I wrote this song “Stir Crazy” which is a bit of a chuckle about our frustrations with quarantine and social distancing. My band TELL recorded it and we made this really fun music video in advance of our album release in June. I’ve long felt welcomed here as a contributor on DKOS so I wanted to share some of my music. Click below. Hope you like it!
