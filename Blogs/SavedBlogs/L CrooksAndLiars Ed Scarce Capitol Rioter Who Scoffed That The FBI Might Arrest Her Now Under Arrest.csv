L, Capitol Rioter Who Scoffed That The FBI Might Arrest Her Now Under Arrest, Ed Scarce, 03-20-21, Replete in their MAGA gear that day these two jailbirds must both be in utter dismay that they're under arrest and facing decades of incarceration should they get their deserved punishment. Vogel writing on social media on January 14th “The people being arrested are law-abiding tax paying citizens." And then some gibberish about the "tyrants" who allowed the "fraudulent" election results to stand. Source: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Philip C. Vogel II and Debra J. Maimone both of New Castle were charged with theft entering restricted buildings and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.  According to charging documents filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia a Parler social media account registered to Ms. Maimone featured the two inside the Capitol Crypt amid the riot. The camera panned to Ms. Maimone’s face and she removed her “distinctive American flag mask” and said “It’s amazing” the documents read. Mr. Vogel offscreen says to her: “Put your mask back on. I don’t want them to see you” according to court papers. The charging documents feature screenshots allegedly showing the two inside the Capitol building with Ms. Maimone wearing a shirt reading “GOD GUNS TRUMP” in red lettering The two were then caught on camera pushing against police with Vogel kicking in a door both wearing gas masks. Maimone seemed unaware that she and Vogel were breaking the law responding on Parler that she might be arrested by the FBI “Lmao yaaaaaaaaaa sure thing buddy!" Ms. Maimone under the username TrumpIsYourPresident1776 responded: “I’m not saying that you stupid couch potato. I’m saying I was at the government building FULL OF TYRANTS and I WATCHED A TON of patriots that were fed up with being shot at flash banged and gassed for trying to peacefully protest!” When someone said the FBI would be arresting everyone who illegally went into the building Ms. Maimone said: “Lmao yaaaaaaaaaa sure thing buddy! Good thing I wasn’t in there. Although I support all the Americans that did their duty that day!” "The FBI digital team will be arresting all who illegally entered the DC [Capitol]."TrumpIsYourPresident1776: "Lmao yaaaaaaaaaa sure thing buddy!”The FBI arrested Debra Maimone in New Castle PA today. pic.twitter.com/2nTUPKyVhc — Ryan J.
