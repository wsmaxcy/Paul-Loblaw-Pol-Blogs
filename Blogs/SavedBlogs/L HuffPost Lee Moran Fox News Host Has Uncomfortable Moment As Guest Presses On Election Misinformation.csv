L, Fox News Host Has Uncomfortable Moment As Guest Presses On Election Misinformation, Lee Moran, 2021-05-11, Fox News host Martha MacCallum didn’t take kindly to being pressed about the cable channel’s role in spreading election misinformation during Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Story.” MacCallum and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten were discussing the teaching of critical race theory when Weingarten pivoted to talk about ex-President Donald Trump’s election lies which have been promoted on the widely watched conservative network. “I would hope that Fox would be just as focused on let’s get rid of the misinformation about what happened in this election” said Weingarten. “This election was free and fair.” “Oh come on Randi come on” interrupted MacCallum. “This is not the topic we’re here to talk about. I’m not going to talk about that. We’ve talked about that before.” MacCallum tried to switch subjects but Weingarten went back to it later. “If you’re talking about misinformation now Martha and I hope you are I really would hope that Fox would really look at what happened in this election and how we can because every social studies teacher is wrestling with this to discern fact from fiction. We have to do that” Weingarten said. MacCallum let out an audible sigh. “Yeah we have a president President Biden was elected in 2020. I think that all of that is quite clear” the anchor replied. “So I’m not sure why you are so concerned with that part with that particular moment in history. Every election is significant. Nobody is hiding anything under any rocks here.” Watch the exchange here:
