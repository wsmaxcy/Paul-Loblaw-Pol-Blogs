C, Relevant Classic Texts (4), Steven Hayward, 2021-06-18, This weekend’s main topic of the Three Whisky Happy Hour podcast will be an exploration of Edmund Burke in part because we received an interesting reader email after a recent episode that prompted an argument between me and Lucretia (she is a Burke skeptic to put it mildly).  In rereading Burke in preparation for our taping this evening I was struck by several passages in Burke’s most famous work Reflections on the Revolution in France that describe the temper and disposition of the wokerati behind the genuinely revolutionary moment America is going through. Most of these excerpts don’t need any stage direction from me to appreciate the accuracy and application of Burke for today—especially on such things as rioting “defund the police” the impulse to repudiate the American Founding—everything that Roger Scruton (a Burkean) summed up with his phrase for the left: the “culture of repudiation.” All circumstances taken together the French Revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world. The most wonderful things are brought about in many instances by means the most absurd and ridiculous in the most ridiculous modes and apparently by the most contemptible instruments. Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity and of all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. In viewing this monstrous tragi-comic scene the most opposite passions necessarily succeed and sometimes mix with each other in the mind: alternate contempt and indignation alternate laughter and tears alternate scorn and horror. It cannot however be denied that to some this strange scene appeared in quite another point of view. Into them it inspired no other sentiments than those of exultation and rapture. They saw nothing in what has been done in France but a firm and temperate exertion of freedom — so consistent on the whole with morals and with piety as to make it deserving not only of the secular applause of dashing Machiavelian politicians but to render it a fit theme for all the devout effusions of sacred eloquence. . . A spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views. People will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors. . . You had all these advantages in your ancient states; but you chose to act as if you had never been moulded into civil society and had everything to begin anew. You began ill because you began by despising everything that belonged to you. You set up your trade without a capital. If the last generations of your country appeared without much lustre in your eyes you might have passed them by and derived your claims from a more early race of ancestors. Under a pious predilection for those ancestors your imaginations would have realized in them a standard of virtue and wisdom beyond the vulgar practice of the hour; and you would have risen with the example to whose imitation you aspired. Respecting your forefathers you would have been taught to respect yourselves. You would not have chosen to consider the French as a people of yesterday as a nation of low-born servile wretches until the emancipating year of 1789. . . Compute your gains; see what is got by those extravagant and presumptuous speculations which have taught your leaders to despise all their predecessors and all their contemporaries and even to despise themselves until the moment in which they became truly despicable. . . They would soon see that criminal means once tolerated are soon preferred. They present a shorter cut to the object than through the highway of the moral virtues. Justifying perfidy and murder for public benefit public benefit would soon become the pretext and perfidy and murder the end — until rapacity malice revenge and fear more dreadful than revenge could satiate their insatiable appetites. . . Your literary men and your politicians and so do the whole clan of the enlightened among us essentially differ in these points. They have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own. With them it is a sufficient motive to destroy an old scheme of things because it is an old one. As to the new they are in no sort of fear with regard to the duration of a building run up in haste; because duration is no object to those who think little or nothing has been done before their time and who place all their hopes in discovery. They conceive very systematically that all things which give perpetuity are mischievous and therefore they are at inexpiable war with all establishments. They think that government may vary like modes of dress and with as little ill effect; that there needs no principle of attachment except a sense of present conveniency to any constitution of the state. . . They find themselves obliged to rake into the histories of former ages (which they have ransacked with a malignant and profligate industry) for every instance of oppression and persecution which has been made by that body or in its favor in order to justify upon very iniquitous because very illogical principles of retaliation their own persecutions and their own cruelties. After destroying all other genealogies and family distinctions they invent a sort of pedigree of crimes. It is not very just to chastise men for the offences of their natural ancestors; but to take the fiction of ancestry in a corporate succession as a ground for punishing men who have no relation to guilty acts except in names and general descriptions is a sort of refinement in injustice belonging to the philosophy of this enlightened age. . . We hear these new teachers continually boasting of their spirit of toleration. That those persons should tolerate all opinions who think none to be of estimation is a matter of small merit. Equal neglect is not impartial kindness. The species of benevolence which arises from contempt is no true charity. . . Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
