L, Tweets Of The Week Apr 11-17 2021, oldhippiedude, 2021-04-18, Before we begin. a quick announcement. Last week I floated the idea of posting the TOTW later in the day to allow me a few more hours to put it all together and to hopefully engage a bit more with your comments. In a poll and i comments most of you said that it would be OK to post later. Since this is TOTW and not the United States Senate we’re going to let the majority rule. Beginning next week this weekly display of right wing hilarity will be posted every Sunday evening at 7 PM Central Time. Please adjust your crowded Sunday schedules accordingly. In other news yours truly is now fully vaccinated. The vaccine rollout has been so successful that this is hardly news and there’s no reason why you should particularly care but I’m telling everybody. If you’ve been vaccinated you know the feeling that I’m talking about. If not hurry up and get those shots and you’ll feel it too. Meanwhile the doofuses on the other side of the aisle were busy this week. Let’s take a look...  Here’s to being fully vaccinated! pic.twitter.com/eXl3CaxdyS Matt Gaetz spotted holding boombox over his head outside Mar A Lago.  https://t.co/w4fHSB0MPI The Leastie BoysWhitealiciousSalt-N-SaltPublic EnemaDoubtKastBrand QAnonThe SuitsHairoglyphicsBaddie Mob https://t.co/p7Wggf5Xt1 I'm no public health expert but from what I've seen the clotting issue needs study. But since it only affected women the right move would've been for the FDA to declare J+J the "Dudes Only" vaccine and then print t-shirts that say "It Takes a Real Man to Handle This Johnson" "But Satan if you give me half of your damned souls I can turn that around & create more damned souls for you!" - Bernie Madoff back at work DON JR: "Yo Matty dude why wasn't I invited to these wild off-the-chain parties?"MATT GAETZ: "We wanted to make sure there were enough drugs for everyone."https://t.co/wrV7Q1hn5i Phrasing here makes about as much sense as describing a father as a  “man implicated in a sperm-involved incident that ended in the birth of a local baby” https://t.co/yZMrIDtvVM It's getting so police can't even act like criminals without being treated like criminals. He wears his mask like a “doctor” in porn. pic.twitter.com/it71VWLlmz I feel like AOC would totally do this but she’s so busy on committees that...oh uh sorry. https://t.co/z0Cp1YODTI Is Ted Cruz our government's anus?  A return to daub and wattle cottages with a drafty fireplace? https://t.co/2NbU5iSDkN A face made for masks https://t.co/DkTxFLnW7x P.S. fuck you @NRA Reminder that the same Republicans who say we can't stop every mass shooting also say we CAN stop teenagers from having sex. It might be a mistake to call Republicans “Nazis.”Nazis were far better educated. Proposed slogan for America First Caucus: "White nationalists do it with extreme prejudice." Whew!  Now that I'm finally vaccinated I can go back to washing my hands for only EIGHTEEN seconds.
