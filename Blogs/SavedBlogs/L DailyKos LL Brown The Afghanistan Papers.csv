L, The Afghanistan Papers, LL Brown, 2021-07-02, I wake up groggy this am and I'm reading in Wapo about withdrawing from Afghanistan and in it  I come across this video clip  titled  " The Afghanistan Papers: A secret history of the war." See  Link to Article. " U.S. military vacates main air base in Afghanistan underscoring withdrawal expected within daysBy Dan Lamothe https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/02/bagram-afghanistan-biden-war/ " Not wanting to face the morning I watch the video buried a few paragraphs in wapo.st/… I am totally stunned by this story of our top people stating we don't know why we spent blood & treasure revealed as part of SIGAR investigation. I check the print edition on the website I can't find any reference to either article. Morning Joe is all about Allan W & DT. Did I fall into a worm hole overnite or do we no longer care about the post 9-11 years? Or is old news I just missed?
