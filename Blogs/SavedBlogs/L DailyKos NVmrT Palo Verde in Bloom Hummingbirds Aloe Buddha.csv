L, Palo Verde in Bloom Hummingbirds Aloe Buddha, NVmrT, 2021-05-01,  This is my very favorite time of year. When the Palo Verde trees blossom out in April the desert is awash in yellow. Palo Verde trees are widespread throughout the Sonoran Desert Southwest (and beyond). Cities plant them along roads and median strips and they seem to dominate Walmart parking lots. The native ‘green’ palo verde grow at elevations of about 1500 to 2500 feet and share the landscape with mesquite trees whick are usually in the washes. One of the densest PV forests I have seen is north of Phoenix where I used to live.When I moved to the Las Vegas area one of the first things I did was plant PV and Mesquite trees. The tree in these photos (planted 13 years ago) is a Sonoran Desert Museum strain developed to be more resistent to the Palo Verde Borer Beetle and diseases. It also grows much larger with more flexible branches that sway with the wind.In addition other less common varieties of native PV are the ‘Blue’ PV (a nasty thorny grey bushy tree) and the Mexican or Shaggy PV which has long strand-like leaves and is also a thorny messy tree.The pictured tree is also home to hummingbirds who are nesting right now (see pics below).And I threw in a photo of the Happy Buddha Aloe garden. Enjoy!!
