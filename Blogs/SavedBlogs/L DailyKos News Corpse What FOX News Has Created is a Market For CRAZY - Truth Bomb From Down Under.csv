L, 'What FOX News Has Created is a Market For CRAZY' - Truth Bomb From Down Under, News Corpse, 2021-04-18, The vast majority of the American people recognize that Fox News is a deceitful cabal of propagandists bent on advancing the interests of radical Republicans and Trump cultists. Never mind the ratings. While Fox Entertainment is leading the other legitimate news networks that's only because they have a near monopoly on the right-wing fringe. Their actual penetration into the population at large is only about one percent. Nevertheless Fox News is deliberately dividing the nation on behalf the corporations and wealthy elites they represent. And they have an impact because other media parrots their partisan rhetoric and helps to disseminate their lies. But they aren't fooling everyone and especially not the leaders of foreign countries that have their own problems with Rupert Murdoch's media. Case in point on CNN's Reliable Sources Sunday morning Malcolm Turnbull the former Prime Minister of Australia Murdoch's birthplace explained to host Brian Stelter why Fox News is so dangerous (video below). And he wasn't mincing words: Exactly! And Turnbull's commentary applies just as much to Donald Trump as it does to Fox News. The talk of "collusion" during the first impeachment of Trump barely scratched the surface of the conspiracy that engulfed Trump Russia and Fox News. They were (and still are) all working toward the same ends: Turning Americans against each other and their country. Turnbull continued saying that... The evidence of the ultra "crazy" market that Fox News created is all too apparent in the Trump insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th. It is apparent in the adoption of QAnon insanity by many on the right including the QAnon supporting primetime host Tucker Carlson. And it couldn't be more obvious than when Fox News denies that the GOP is the party of QAnon. Turnbull concluded by asking whether America is "a more divided country than it was before thanks to Murdoch's influence?" The answer is an unequivocal "Yes!" Murdoch is a foreign-born domestic terrorist who has never had the best interests of the nation at heart. To the contrary he has spent his lifetime attempting to pervert democracies in order to empower the oligarchs and enrich himself. The harm done by Fox News is extensive and destructive. And Trump is just as responsible for it as Murdoch and his treasonous media manipulators. They have been executing the agenda of Vladimir Putin who couldn't be more pleased with the efforts by Trump and Fox News. And they must be called out at every opportunity for their betrayal.
