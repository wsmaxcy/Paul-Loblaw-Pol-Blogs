L, $5 trillion fix every problem possible through reconciliation bill coming!! Very Exciting News!, sreeizzle2012, 2021-06-28, www.rollcall.com/…  Joe Manchin wants the infrastructure bill to be aggressive as possible using $4 trillion.  www.businessinsider.com/… www.businessinsider.com/…  Bernie Sanders and most people in America want it to be $6 trillion.   $5 trillion is the logical maximum reasonable middle ground compromise.  Hypothetically it can be (1.2 trillion from bipartisan bill plus 4.8 trillion from reconciliation bill which exactly totals $6 trillion).   The math adds up.  Sen. Tim Kaine a member of Senate Budget told us Democrats are engaged in talks this week to sort out price tag of reconciliation bill -- and will try to come to an agreement among themselves by July work period. He has proposed near $4 trillion  If Rs block the bipartisan deal in the Senate Ds would just fold that into the larger reconciliation bill he said"We would say 'OK you killed the bipartisan deal. But ok you gave us some good ideas. .. And you're going to see your priorities included here in reconciliation”  We will hit 50% fully double dose nationally vaccinated by July 4th. Then we will see what happens all the way to the end of the year. I am optimistic we can hit 60% nationally double dosed eventually and all the blue states/Biden voter heavy areas will reach herd immunity. From there is a big question.  www.beckershospitalreview.com/.…  Eventually we will hit 55% percent baseline approval by the end of this year and ride it all the way to mid-terms plus 2024. We should hit 60% by the time 2024 election comes around. We will be singing kumbaya thank you. Once we hit 60% Biden’s disapproval will fall below 40% eventually.
