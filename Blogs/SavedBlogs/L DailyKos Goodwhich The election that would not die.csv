L, The election that would not die, Goodwhich, 2021-04-22, Recounting the 2020 election ballots in Maricopa County Arizona is the new great American pastime. Several recounts already have been done finding no fraud but Republicans just can’t accept it. As a resident of Phoenix what I’m learning about this new “audit” beginning this week has me truly frightened. I thought I would share the text of the letter I just sent to my state senator Paul Boyer (R). The Arizona State Senate is the group that called for this audit which is being handled by several firms including Florida-based Cyber Ninjas whose owner allegedly traffics in pro-Trump conspiracy theories. Dear Senator Boyer As one of your constituents I am writing to convey my dismay about this new audit of Maricopa County’s 2020 election ballots. Here are specific points I’m objecting to: • Several audits of these ballots have already been conducted by both parties and the Arizona Board of Supervisors. No fraud was found and everything checked out each time. • I don’t know whether the outer envelopes still remain with the ballots or not. Even so I’m concerned about privacy knowing that some stranger from another state is holding my sacred ballot in his or her hands. Are these people trained and certified to do this type of work? • How do we know some of these so-called “auditors” won't try to re-mark ballots after the fact in favor of Trump or put a stray mark on some ballots “accidentally” so that they can no longer be read by a scanner and have to be discarded? They can always say the mark was there when they got the ballot and it shouldn’t have been counted in the first place thereby negating thousands of votes. • How much is this going to cost? Is any of my taxpayer money going toward funding this? • My ability to vote by mail at home is very important to me. I want to be assured that the PEVL [Permanent Early Voting List] will continue and I will continue to vote by mail in all Arizona elections going forward. I studied for a year in Germany in 1983-84. This was before the Berlin Wall came down when there was still an East Germany. During my time there I traveled into communist East Germany (East Berlin Dresden) and Czechoslovakia (Prague). I experienced Russian soldiers at train stations asking to see my papers automatic rifles slung over their shoulders. I watched them slide mirrors under the bus I was riding in to make sure no one was hanging on underneath trying to escape from East to West. I toured the Reichstag and Checkpoint Charlie and learned a great deal about fascism and how the German people ended up going down that dark hole with Adolf Hitler. How do you do it? • You monopolize the media and print only what you want people to know. Whether it’s true or not doesn’t even matter (of course back then the press consisted only of newspapers books radio and posters). If any newspapers or books speak out against you you hold a book-burning. • You overturn regular elections and hold your own election making sure you win. • You take away people's right to protest and silence any voices against you. • You start your propaganda machine and direct it especially toward youth and the uneducated adults. They can’t fight it because they’re not educated enough to think critically about it. Make it sound good and they lap it up. • You identify a scapegoat group among the people to blame everyone’s troubles on and start wholesale persecution of those people. • You corrupt the military and the police and enforce all these actions through threats and violence. • And you demoralize people to the point that they can't fight anymore and they decide to just go along to get along. It is frightening to see the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA—the world's light of democracy liberty and freedom—taking big steps down this road. It isn't sane it isn't right and it isn't my country. I'd appreciate it if you would write back and inform me regarding what's being done about some of these questions I've raised about this "audit." Thank you.
