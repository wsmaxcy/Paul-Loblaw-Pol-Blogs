L, Yesterday Lytton B.C. was Hottest Town in North America (121.3F) Now the Town is GONE - 90% Burned, Lefty Coaster, 2021-07-01, Lytton British Colombia is a small town of 250 on the Frasier River 100 miles northeast of Vancouver 60 miles west of Kamloops along the Trans -Canada Highway. It’s located in the Frasier River Canyon and canyons can channel high winds.   By Maria Weisgarber VANCOUVER -- In the days leading up to the devastating fire in Lytton temperatures in the village repeatedly shattered Canadian records during an extreme heat wave gripping the province which also saw a sharp rise in sudden deaths in B.C. Now university professors following the impacts of climate change say this kind of intense period of heat will likely not be an isolated event and more action needs to be taken now. Earth Sciences Professor Emeritus at Simon Fraser University John Clague said the so-called “heat dome” arrived following a stretch in June with little precipitation.  During the heat wave the highest recorded temperature in Lytton pushed close to 50 degrees Celsius.  Clague said the air stream that controls our climate is now behaving in irregular ways and drawing air in from areas that are prone to hot weather. “The foundation of our climate is changing and we can expect more events of this type” he said. “It’s not just that (the) climate’s going to get one or two degrees warmer on averages globally it’s these extremes that we can expect that are driven by the total change in the climate system.” 486 sudden deaths were reported during the five days of British Columbia's unprecedented heatwave.   Until this week “Canada’s hot spot” might have seemed like a charming nickname for Lytton B.C. a tiny town where summer temperatures soar. But after a week of tragedy the tagline has an ominous edge. Lytton broke successive Canadian heat records early this week with temperatures peaking at 121 degrees on Tuesday afternoon. Then the fires swept in. Local news says a recent lightning storm in eastern British Columbia spawned some 53 fires. There is talk that Canada may send in the Army to fight the fires in B.C.  I live 150 miles from  Lytton and the Olympic Mountains are disappearing in the smoky haze.  .  no wordshttps://t.co/57i0G1OYM6 This is horrific.  More horrific is the possibility if not the probability that Lytton won’t be the last town in North America to burn during this fire season.   UPDATE: The CBC reports 500 active fires across B.C. tonight.
