L, Black Kos Tuesday's Chile: Joy Reid drops a box of receipts on Carlson and Greenwald gets ratioed, Black Kos, 2021-05-04, Commentary By Black Kos Editor Denise Oliver-Velez Somebody needs to tell Tucker Carlson not to mess with Black women. His latest snide supremacist sneers and jeers got slapback from his target MSNBC’s Joy Ann Reid host of The Reid Out. She sliced and diced him with humor after his latest wimpy set of twit-isms characterizing her as “The Race Lady.” The Root’s Stephen A. Crockett Jr. commented. Tucker Carlson Calls Joy Reid 'The Race Lady.' Hopefully Reid Challenges Him to a Cage Fight https://t.co/fxZSdIY2fS pic.twitter.com/Tc8hjQRtRL  I don’t enjoy violence. In fact after being forced to see months of killings of unarmed Black men women and children shot and killed by police I’m good if I never see another violent thing ever again. Except I wouldn’t mind seeing Tucker Carlson get his ass beat by MSNBC host Joy Reid. Reid is of course too classy for this level of ratchetness. But man I can’t tell you how much I would enjoy watching Reid take off her earrings pin her hair back apply Vaseline to her face and then Sharkeisha the fuck out of Carlson. Mostly because Reid is a Black American hero and you don’t fuck with Reid. Ever. Well she didn’t take off her earrings Brooklyn style so no Vaseline needed.  She did respond and it was epic. For those of you who can’t watch this atm or can’t hear it here’s the transcript. Transcript  The Reid Out 5/3/21 REID: So just for the record I don`t spend a lot of time watching Fox News or the B.S. factory as CNN`s Jim Acosta colorfully dubbed them this weekend. Personally I prefer my news and information to be grounded in reality rather than monetizing my amygdala to keep me on edge and buying My Pillows and gold. However according to "Media Matters" "The Root" "Crooks and Liars" and others who watch Fox News so you don`t have to at least three times in last month well Tucker Carlson took time off from badgering strangers in parks and bouncy houses to demand they show him their unmasked faces to refer to me as the race lady. The race lady? Why he called me that? I mean I used to run track in high school but I mean honestly I`m not that fast. So what else could it be? Hmm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON FOX NEWS HOST: Watch the race lady on MSNBC Harvard educated but totally oppressed. An absurdly racist claim says the race lady from Harvard. Joy Reid the racist lady over at MSNBC. Here`s the race lady from MSNBC finally putting her Harvard degree to work. Oh wait a second Harvard-educated race lady now you`re really confusing us. Well Joy Ann Reid the race lady over on MSNBC took a quick break from haranguing Whitey yesterday. (END VIDEO CLIP) REID: Did he say Whitey? Oh honey honey Tuckems (ph) is this really about me fixating on race or is it about you fixating on race? I mean when you recently went off on me for continuing to mask up post-vaccine while jogging in crowded Central Park you weirdly as you did in that montage threw in my attending Harvard. Now I don`t know maybe I`m sensitive to this stuff but it felt like dog whistle. I mean did you want to go and they reject you? And you think oh they let the race lady in bleh affirmative action bleh. Well listen let me cheer you up OK? I got into Harvard and OK Yale Vassar and University of Denver too because I had really high GPA and fantastic SAT scores. And that`s how affirmative action works love. Schools search for smart people from diverse backgrounds so these schools won`t be as dry as the major sports leagues were before they desegregated. See? Just because you know maybe you didn`t have great grades and great test scores and needed your girlfriend`s daddy to help you get into college doesn`t mean you don`t have amazing people in your life who love you. I mean you got lots of money right? Let`s fix for everybody. And you know you had fun at Trinity after you know you were bought in right? By the way what was the Dan White Society? You know what moving on. Just because the CIA rejected your application I mean look things turned out fine for you. You had a great career over here at MSNBC -- oh actually that didn`t work out. Look you were great on CNN though until Jon Stewart kind of humiliated you. But it`s fine you`re fine. Things are going great for you. Back to the whole race thing just saying I`m not one who spools out of my neighborhood changing like I`m some segregationist housewife from the 1950s. That would be you Tuckems. And I`m not the one spouting a conspiracy theory that white people are going to be replaced by a Democratic Party conspiracy to import nonwhite people to outnumber them a theory that was also mouthed by the Charlottesville tiki torch Nazis. That would also be you. And the reason I continue to mask up in crowded places is because I don`t know how many people in those crowds that I`m jogging around didn`t hear about the court case where your bosses said that your show isn`t news. So they listen to you like you are the news. And I don`t trust that people who listen to you Tuckems are taking precautions against COVID rather than freaking out about a piece of cloth and busting into Target to cough on the cereal boxes like they`re 17th century colonizers touting measles blankets with them. Like you and your friends and the B.S. factory are keeping us steeped in COVID sickness and rage and paranoia and the ways in which you lil` Tucker are making America worst are why I will continue to keep my mask on in a crowd. And we`ll have more on your endless COVID hell that the endless COVID hell that the Tuckers of our country who by the way are the absolute worst are helping to create. And that is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) Reid coming under attack is not new. Increasingly Black women are targets. Literally like Ma’Khia Bryant who Black Kos Editor Joan Mar wrote about last week and verbally like our Black elected sisters. It doesn’t just come from those racists of the right either – nor are all the targets public figures like Madame Vice President Kamala Harris and Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Tucker Carlson’s frequent guest and cut-buddy Glenn Greenwald thought he could get away with (again) going after a not blue check Twitter account like Sister Chantay Berry’s in his efforts to smear the KHive calling her a “gay-hating Neo-Nazi.” You're a gay-hating neo-Nazi whose life is devoted to helping run a childish yet toxic fan club for an overzealous cop who gets off on imprisoning non-violent offenders.https://t.co/LE8vJDBxNE Really Glenn? Nice try but fail. You and your 1.6M Twitter followers make think you can beatdown accounts like Chantay’s who has 9894 followers. We have her back and you are being ratioed — by Black folks and LGBTQ folks and those of us who know exactly what misogynoir is.  Glenn Greenwald has been defending white nationalists nonstop. Even frequents the FoxNews racist hour of power for friendly fireside chats with Tucker Carlson. Name-calling a Black woman in return is not going to silence her or anyone else. https://t.co/3a8UdEgnK1  Berry has responded to Greenwald. Bluntly and to the point. Told him to stop being a m-f*cking troll on the internet. Part II: “Let’s Address Glenn Greenwald” To be fair Glenn Greenwald is a terrible journalist. He built his career on spewing Russian propaganda and Right-Wing talking points. Now he’s unemployed and much worse than ever. Here’s my advice for him. pic.twitter.com/jxLzIvgQ9J  Rather than post other folks responses ratioing Greenwald here and take up more of your reading time I’ll post some of them to the Twitter roundup in comments.  I have a sneaking suspicion that Sis Chantay got put on a target list when she got retweeted by Hillary Clinton last month. 👀 https://t.co/IIgSSbCDUC Whatever.  Take this advice. Don’t come for Black women. Bryant and Harlins like so many Black girls in America have had their lives reduced to the circumstances of their deaths as videos and images of their final moments continue to circulate for the world to see. Meanwhile their loved ones and communities are left upholding the truth about who they were while media reports and larger conversations might not include aspects of these girls that point to their humanity such as their favorite hobbies their career aspirations or how they were doing in school. So what will it take for Black girls to just exist on and off screen? Disrupting American society’s harmful tendencies to portray Black girls as more mature than other children their age—to deny them of their childhoods—is key for experimental documentary filmmaker and photographer Sophia Nahli Allison whose work aims to portray young Black girls as just that: young girls. The Los Angeles native’s documentary short A Love Song for Latasha which was nominated for an Oscar this year and is streaming on Netflix is a moving tribute from Allison and Harlins’ loved ones to the young girl’s life. The film captures the essence and showcases the fullness of Harlins something that reports on her death always failed to do. (Harlins’ death was one of the inciting incidents of the 1992 L.A. race riots and the trial against her killer store owner Soon Ja Du garnered national attention; although Du was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter she received a light sentence of probation and community service.) Throughout the 19-minute film Harlins’ cousin Shinese Harlins and her best friend Tybie O’Bard share their memories of Latasha—like her aspirations to become a lawyer her love of basketball and a memorable poem that she wrote just one month before her life was tragically cut short. They also share the impact that Harlins’ death has had on their own lives. Atop these voice-overs there are photos of Harlins and footage of the South Central community in which Harlins grew up. The film also uses experimental animation and music such as Noname’s striking “Don’t Forget About Me” in which she sings “I know everyone goes someday/ I know my body’s fragile know it’s made from clay/ But if I have to go I pray my soul is still eternal/ And my momma don’t forget about me/ I pray my momma don’t forget about me/ I pray my granny don’t forget about me.” From ‘Afro Samurai’ to ‘Cannon Busters’ Black anime is not a fad. It’s a movement that’s here to stay thanks to writers like Nick Jones Jr. The New Jersey native and Marine veteran has gone from fighting for our country overseas to helping lead the push for Black stories through a classic Japanese art form.  His new Netflix anime series ‘Yasuke’ starring Lakeith Stanfield voicing the title role adds a fantasy twist to a piece of Black history. It’s inspired by the true story of the only known Black samurai in feudal Japan (See: Black Kos Week In Review - The True Story Of Japan's African Samurai) believed by historians to have fought in wars in the late 1500’s. EBONY contributor Brandon Pope had a chat with Jones Jr. to find out more about the new series how he drew on his own personal traumas to craft the story and how former President Barack Obama ignited his journey through Hollywood. EBONY: You served in the United States Marine Corps. How did you make that pivot to film and TV? Nick Jones Jr.: Oh man now that’s a crazy story. It was President Obama he was the reason. We had a chance encounter in Hawaii after one of my deployments and he just kind of sat me down and talked me through what I want to do with my life and what I want to do in my career. Was that staying 20 years in the Marine Corps or doing something else? At the time I was just like “I want to be in the industry. I want to be an actor” and all this other stuff. “But I think it’s impossible.” And that’s when he stopped and looked at me and was just like “I’m a Black man about to be president nothing’s impossible.” We stayed in contact after that. He and Michelle sat me down and they just laid out a plan this is what you need to do how you need to do it. I took notes he told me about the about the GI Bill which I ended up using to go to film school out here in Los Angeles. I just kind of followed their steps and followed that blueprint. So even though I’m not in politics I do consider myself from the Barack Obama tree. In the United States only 1% of venture capital funded startup founders are Black. The dismal number leads one to wonder if the disproportionate allocation of funds to help Black and Brown businesses grow could be preventing them from expanding to household names. With the tragic murder of George Floyd opening the eyes of many in America to the inequity occurring in the “land of the free” organizations are fighting back with their dollars. In the investment world VCs are creating funds specifically for Black entrepreneurs and interested in supporting more Black founders. However there are investors like Mitch Brooks and Tristan Wilkerson who have invested in Black businesses for over a decade. The long-time friends are widening their impact and doubling down on their expertise to help close the multiple gaps in the VC world. Everything about the men and their mission is filled with purpose. The creation of High Street Equity Partners is a dream realized for Brooks and Wilkerson. The name bears meaning from Wilkerson’s Southern roots. He shared “The name High Street is a historic street name in Little Rock Arkansas. It was the center of business and innovation and where a lot of Black and minority businesses were concentrated. The name is a homage to the vision and goal of the firm.” Two men dropped their tools and fled on foot from an approaching motorbike. They abandoned their own motorcycle yellow jugs of water two hoes and several charred lumps of wood. Nearby wisps of smoke leaked from soil mounds. Further afield lay bare roots of freshly felled trees. They had been making charcoal the same way people have done for years stretching back into prehistory: Cut down trees; gather the logs and branches into piles; cover them with earth; light a fire underneath; and let it slowly burn for about a week to produce a fuel that burns hotter and discharges less smoke than wood does. This charcoal produced from the receding forest at Agyana an agrarian community on the edge of Nigeria’s capital territory Abuja is then packaged in bags and sold to consumers all over the world for their barbecue grills many of them unaware of the origin. It’s also in high demand locally where urban households buy it from kiosks to cook their meals. The producers mostly young men invade the forests in droves in search of income. In Agyana the charcoal producers have formed an association. The two men who fled association chairman Gimba Abubakar explained ran from him because they did not pay the association’s levies. Nigeria lost nearly half of its forest area between 2007 and 2017 according to the World Bank’s Little Green Data Book. In 2017 the staggering deforestation forced environmental policymakers to recommend a de facto ban on charcoal export by ceasing to issue the permits required to produce charcoal for export legally. But the following year with this policy still in place other countries’ import of Nigerian charcoal grew by 34 percent according to Comtrade the United Nations export and import database. Charcoal use for pleasure rather than subsistence seems to be increasing: In 2020 the United States alone imported over 158 million kilograms of charcoal from various countries 42 percent more than in 2019 and more than twice the amount a decade ago in 2010. Africa accounted for about two-thirds of global wood charcoal production in 2018 with dire consequences for the continent’s carbon-absorbing forests. Deforestation is frequently blamed on local dependence on wood fuels in addition to land cleared for farming timber and construction. But there is also another factor: illicit charcoal export to countries in Europe and North America with abundant modern energy sources consuming charcoal for leisure and novelty. And because illicit charcoal export is hard to track very little is known about the extent of the issue. The Biden administration has arrived with some grand promises for its foreign policy among them to “rally the nations of the world to defend democracy globally” and “empower” U.S. diplomats who were “politicized” under the previous administration. But a controversial recent election in one of Africa’s largest countries raises a fundamental question. Is the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus even capable of exploiting opportunities to assist potential democratic breakthroughs? How and why U.S. diplomats—mainly veteran career officers rather than Trumpianoutsiders—decided to spurn such an opportunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2018 has important implications for the Biden administration. It suggests that to fulfill his pledge Biden will need to take steps to ensure his top foreign-policy appointees are strongly invested in democracy promotion and that career foreign service officers are not only empowered but also incentivized to think beyond short-term accommodations with local leaders. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Voices and Soul by Justice Putnam Black Kos Poetry Editor It is said that children are the hope of the world and it is also said children are the most cruel.
