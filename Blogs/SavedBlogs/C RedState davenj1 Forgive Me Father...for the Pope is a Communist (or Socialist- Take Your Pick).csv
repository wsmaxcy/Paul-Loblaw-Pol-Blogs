C, Forgive Me Father...for the Pope is a Communist (or Socialist- Take Your Pick), davenj1, 2020-12-11, Just when you thought 2020 could get any more ridiculous- a bogus impeachment trial a bogus pandemic a bogus Presidential election- comes word of the granddaddy of bogusness.  In the name of the Father Son and Catholic Church Pope Francis has decided to lend his name credibility and largesse of the Catholic faithful by joining the Council of Inclusive Capitalism. Before you laugh at the concept- let alone the name- consider this fact: others involved with this endeavor “…“boasts over more than $10.5 trillion in assets under management companies with over $2.1 trillion of market capitalization and 200 million workers in over 163 countries.”  The founder of the Council is none other than Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild (yes…THOSE Rothschilds) who said: Capitalism has created enormous global prosperity but it has also left too many people behind led to the degradation of our planet and is not widely trusted in society. This council will follow the warning from Pope Francis to listen to ‘the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor’ and answer society’s demands for a more equitable and sustainable model of growth. Although not known for sure the Rothschild wealth is estimated at about $20 billion.  The estimated wealth of the Vatican is a paltry $15 billion.  To make sure that the Council lives up to their virtuous pledges they created…wait for it… Guardians for Inclusive Capitalism (Marvel should sue!).  Composed of 27 members they all hail from the dreaded 1%.  Who are these anointed saints of guardianship of capitalism?  See the list: So… what are their goals?  We’ll let them speak for themselves: The Guardians will hold themselves accountable committing to a list of intended actions involving environmental social and governance matters.  The Guardians … have said they plan to hire and promote more women increase diversity hires commit to clean energy by purchasing 100% renewable electricity reduce greenhouse gas emissions… Sorta kinda sounds like the Biden/Harris agenda.  Thus in one singular action the Vatican through the Pope has alienated half the American population.  That’s the same America that is the world’s largest economy.  Even more ludicrous is the fact they will “hold themselves accountable.” No longer content to hawk their products to consumers they now hawk a healthy dose of virtue.  That did not work out too well for Gillette with their take on the plague of “toxic masculinity.”  One suspects that Coca-Cola or more specifically Sprite will take a hit when they release their commercial promoting the transgender lifestyle.  Of course what is more virtuous than some self-imposed affirmative action- merit be damned. The Guardians will be promoting a new brand of capitalism- a/k/a virtue-signaling socialism- along with a huge Papal blessing.  Will the concept of racism be turned on its head where racism directed at whites is the equivalent of saying a few “Hail Mary’s” after confession:  “Forgive me father for I am white.”  Says the Pope: “Go and sin no more… and for your penance allow the person of color the next promotion whether they deserve it or not.” It is rather fantastical that Pope Francis would hook up with a bunch of extremely wealthy globalists at a time when a pandemic has swept away millions of jobs many never to return while transforming the already wealthy into much more wealthier (Jeff Bezos anyone?).  So much for the “meek shall inherit the earth.”  According to this Pope he put his eggs in the wealthy globalist Easter basket. It may be tempting to give the Pope the benefit of the doubt here and say that this reaching out to the corporate world is being done with the best of intentions.  But methinks not!  Using the name “capitalism” to destroy capitalism is a ruse which makes Pope Francis a dolt for either believing this nonsense or a co-conspirator.  God made man and we are all God’s children but when he created “man” he created two- and only two- sexes.  Where is the Pope’s defense of this? Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty and misery in a shorter period of time than any other economic system and certainly infinitely more than socialism or communism which have left in their wake greater misery suffering and deaths.  Lest we forget Hitler and the Nazis were socialists and Stalin Pol Pot and Fidel Castro were Communists.  In a few short years Hitler and Stalin killed more than those killed in capitalist countries throughout history prior to the era of Progressivism. By lending his name and that of the Catholic Church it gives the veneer of saintliness wrapped in a shroud of morality for the globalist corporate world.  Instead of making a pact with the devil he would be better served by committing himself to the people and contracting with them.  Socialism has no need of religion other than a rubber stamp and Communism no need whatsoever. How as a Catholic I pine for the days of Pope Benedict who although probably not the nicest of gents was much better than what leads the Vatican today.  Is it any wonder the Catholic Church has fallen out of favor today?  The Catholic Church needs more virtue and a whole hell of a lot less virtue signaling.
