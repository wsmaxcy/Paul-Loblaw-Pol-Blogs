C, How the Left Is Destroying Public Education, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-27, Across the country leftists in charge of public education are substituting indoctrination for learning. Facts and objective standards are out liberal shibboleths are the order of the day. My state Minnesota exemplifies the trend. Under state law the Department of Education promulgates standards and benchmarks for K-12 schools in a variety of disciplines. These standards are periodically revised and this year the Social Studies standards are being rewritten. Under Minnesota’s hard-left governor Tim Walz the committee doing the revision consists almost entirely of left-wingers. That committee has released the first draft of its standards. This draft drops almost everything normally regarded as history–the Revolutionary War the Civil War World War I World War II the Holocaust and any reference to minor figures like George Washington–in favor of political indoctrination like this: * Systemic racism in the United States rooted in our founding * Developing a “respectful awareness” of the LGBTQ+ community * The Reconstruction period specifically successful efforts to disenfranchise newly freed Black Americans and connecting this history to persistent discrimination and inequity in the present * An analysis of the ideology of Manifest Destiny and its relationship to whiteness Christianity and capitalism More here. The committee recently held a public meeting (via Zoom of course) in which members aired their world-views as they relate to teaching Social Studies to school children. This video taken from that meeting consists mostly of audio clips of committee members talking.   Essentially liberals want our schools to be hotbeds of anti-Americanism. Unfortunately just about all of our public school systems are in their hands. Unless voters wake up and demand change the results for our young people and our country promise to be disastrous. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
