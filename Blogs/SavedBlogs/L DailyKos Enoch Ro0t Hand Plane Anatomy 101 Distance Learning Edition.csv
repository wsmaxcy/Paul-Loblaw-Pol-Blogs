L, Hand Plane Anatomy 101 Distance Learning Edition, Enoch Ro0t, 2021-04-25, I’ve posted a few diaries on the subject of vintage hand tools.  Several of them have involved hand planes and I’ve talked about their conditions restorations usages and so on.  Like many who know a bit about their subject matter I sometimes tend to lapse into using jargon without always explaining what it all means.   So a few folks have asked if I might one day post a “Hand Planes 101” diary.   Well since I’ve been laid up with this broken arm all of my two-handed projects are on hold.  But I still have my laptop and can still use it albeit clumsily.  So here’s “Hand Plane Anatomy 101 Distance Learning Edition.” I have a 3-D modeling program called Blender (it’s free!) and this week I decided to use it to reproduce my faithful Stanley No. 4 bench plane which I would then in turn use to illustrate this diary.  What the hell why not?  I have plenty of time on my hand(s) for a while. I could write dozens of diaries about using Blender but they’d all suck.  Anyone interested in learning Blender can get all they need on YouTube from people who are a whole lot better at it than I’ll ever be..  A plane is basically a jig for holding a wood chisel in a fixed position in such a way that it removes a desired amount of material with each pass.  It’s a tool that humans have used for thousands of years.  A Roman-era carpenter would marvel at the complexity and fabrication of this modern plane but would immediately recognize its purpose. The body of the plane is its foundation.  Everything else attaches to it so it has to solid and twist/warp resistant.  It’s made from cast iron which is coated in a durable black finish called Japanning and subsequently machined in the required places. The vertical sides are the cheeks and the opening in the bottom where the cutting blade protrudes is called the mouth.  The flat bottom that contacts the work surface is the sole.  The space above the mouth where the shavings eject is called the throat.  I sense an anatomical theme here.. This next part is the frog.  I’ve seen a few theories on why it’s called that but I think it’s just because it kinda-sorta looks like a crouching frog.  After a few hits of my favorite strain I can see it.. The frog is the most complex part of the plane.  It provides a flat bed for seating the cutting iron and a fore/aft adjustment feature to set the frog in position on the body.  Typically one sets the frog’s fore/aft location once and seldom has to change it.  There’s more — The brass wheel extends and retracts the cutting iron assembly via a pivoting lever mechanism and the long thing sticking out of the top is the lateral adjustment lever.  A little more on those next. The view below shows more detail of the cutting iron adjustment systems with the cutting iron in place.  From now on I’ll just call it the iron. The iron is pivoted side to side with the lateral adjustment lever at top.  Move the lever to the left and the little wheel at the other end will engage the long slot in the iron and rotate the cutting edge slightly to the right enabling you to align the iron’s cutting edge and get a uniform cut.  The adjustment range is only plus or minus a few degrees but that’s all that’s needed. The image below adds the chip breaker which is secured to the iron by a screw.  The chip breaker’s lower end presses against the iron just behind the iron’s cutting edge.  This distance is adjustable — I generally set it to about 3/32” back.  The chip breaker’s function is to stabilize the iron and deflect the wood shavings upward and away. The iron/chip breaker assembly is extended and retracted by turning the brass thumb wheel.  When the wheel is rotated clockwise in this view it backs up and engages the forks on that little black Y-shaped thing (The yoke) that’s hanging down and moves them to the rear.  The yoke pivots on a pin and the other end of it fits a slot in the chip breaker (Which is screwed tightly to the iron so they can be considered as a single piece now) and pushes the iron/chip breaker assembly forward extending the iron’s cutting edge.  To retract you turn the brass wheel counter-clockwise. Now comes the lever cap added in these next two images.  The lever cap presses the iron/chip breaker assembly against the flat bed on the frog but not so tight that the iron can’t be adjusted left/right or in/out.  To remove the lever cap pull up on the finger tab at the top and slide the cap up and back until the screw head slips through the keyhole-shaped opening.  The lever cap tightness is increased or decreased by turning the screw right or left.  The rear handle is known as the tote.  Probably because that’s what you hold on to when you tote it around the job site.  The front handle is called the knob.  Straightforward enough. And that’s my stab at describing your generic Bailey pattern hand plane using deep fake imagery. You have to look hard to find any Stanley identification on this plane.  The iron is marked as per below and “STANLEY”  is faintly stamped into the top of the lateral adjustment lever.  These were marketed as “Bailey” planes in the early 1900’s.  If you’re still reading.. As for the arm fracture I’m now officially on the mend.  My left humerus was snapped clean in half a couple inches below the shoulder and required surgery which happened last week.  They patched the bone ends back together with a plate and a whole bunch of screws.  The scar will be impressive with about 24 staples holding the incisions together.  I asked the doc to try and make the scar look like I’d been slashed by one of those raptors from Jurassic Park.  He said he’d see what he could do.   If you’re not too queasy there’s a short YouTube video here that documents the procedure.  Holy shit it’s a good thing I was asleep at the time.  Our health care system truly sucks when it comes to equitably providing care for everyone but tech-wise it’s pretty damn good.  If you have adequate insurance.  I’m lucky there but why should one’s health care and costs depend on luck?  All that said my outlook would have been pretty grim if all this had happened 150 years ago no matter how much money I had..    That bug is still out there and so are the fools.  Stay safe everyone!
