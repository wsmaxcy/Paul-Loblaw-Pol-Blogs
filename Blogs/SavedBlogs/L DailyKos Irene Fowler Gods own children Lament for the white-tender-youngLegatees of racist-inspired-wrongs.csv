L, God's own children: "Lament for the white-tender-youngLegatees of racist-inspired-wrongs", Irene Fowler, 2021-04-29, We spare our tears so weep not for thee Raving raging racist though you be For the poisons sit seep ever so deep Lament for the white-tender-young Legatees of racist-inspired-wrongs God's own children taught to revile Shared humanity of another hue Joint-heirs of sun air and dew White eyes and ears imbibe the bile Bitter fruit set their teeth on edge Is it already much much too late To lock wide-open infernal gates of hate? Confused contorted outlooks views Inundated with daily hourly brutal news Spin in malleable chained hearts and minds Babes coaxed against man's common sights Brotherhood blown-off blasted blighted Destiny beckons calls forth a new day For ALL inalienable rights.
