L, Tsunami Blue In 22 StrikePac Fights For Me And You, renren, 2021-04-19, I was just reading about the meaningless support by Manchin. Reminds me of McConnell and it's too late to impeach after election bullshit. Agree he's guilty and sabotage justice simultaneously. The whole time acting like we are too stupid to see. Dinos will be irrelevant after 22 elections thanks to StrikePac and all of us working and fighting harder than ever. StrikePac is coming for them all. I've been howling for for Rachel Bitecofer to take over messaging and targeting of districts for dems.  She's going to give both barrels to the evil doers like they deserve. Think of it as our better version of the LP. I'm so excited to see the havoc coming the qop's way. I believe our queen of negative partisanship will get the messaging where it's needed. It will be targeted to the specific group in any given district. The rethugs are great at it but this time we'll be better. Think Georgia times 10. Donate to StrikePac and tell your friends to follow Rachel Bitecofer.
