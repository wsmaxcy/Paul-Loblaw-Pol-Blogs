L, Re: Snyder's NYT Magazine Essay "The War On History is a War on Democracy", GKSMITH, 2021-06-30, Recently preeminent totalitarian scholar Timothy Snyder (Yale) wrote a powerful essay that detailed the explicit and frightening parallels between recent Conservative education legislation and the "memory laws" of Putin's authoritarian regime. The article which I suggest everyon should read made me think of a few important points which will be detailed below.  1. Any statement regarding the "division" that supposedly comes with CRT assumes that teaching our disgusting history with racism anti-Semitism and genocide has been done in any comparable way to the white-washed version. Likewise the word "division" and the accusation that discussing racism increases division is a straw man designed to deflect blame obscure systemic problems and deligitimize the feelings of countless Americans who suffer at the hands of systemic and individual racism on a daily basis. Lest we forget 63% of Americans said the same of MLK in the 60's holding an "unfavorable" view by 1966. This was an increase from 1963 on which 37% of Americans had an unfavorable view (Gallup). What changed? Conservatives used rhetoric like "law and order" and often blamed MLK (and the Civil Rights Movement) for causing violence similarly to what we saw last summer. And while there was a different kind of violence associated with BLM it was nonetheless adjacent to and not an integral or intentional part of the movement (the Civil Rights Movement saw it's share of riots as well albeit often by the local police). 2. There will be growing pains. We will all make mistakes in working towards true egalitarianism true equality. There needs to be increased teacher development and training in having/fostering difficult conversations in class more access to the primary sources of our past that provide a more accurate account. We need to greatly reduce our reliance on textbooks in general. 3. These "memory laws" are nothing new in the US. Jim Crow taught (and solidified) "scientific racism" and eugenics. Tennessee through the Butler Act banned the teaching of evolution "in all public schools and universities". In fact the SCOTUS used to enforce such memory laws upholding the Butler Act in Tennessee v John Scopes (1925). While Scopes served as the first attempt to eradicate such laws it wasn’t until Epperson v. Arkansas (1968) that such laws were declared unconstitutional (the Butler Act was repealed in 1967 just one year before). And because Conservatives continue to push religious indoctrination and dogma into schools (ignoring separation of church and state) another case was required in 2005. In Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III of the PA Federal Court ruled that “intelligent design” is a religious theory and not a scientific one and therefore unconstitutional to be taught. Growing up in the south I was "taught" that the Civil War was fought over "Northern aggression" and "States' Rights" told to read a textbook or accept the teacher's words as fact. Then I went to college read the letters of succession and historical documents (that enlightenment was why I became a teacher).  4. You cannot love something unless you fully understand it no matter how good the propaganda is. As Snyder pointed out multiple times in this fantastic essay the hypocritical rhetoric of the right is nothing but a ruse designed to get people to think they are protecting one thing while actually destroying another (in this case freedom of speech critical thinking history education). I will teach real history using a plethora of primary sources in order to give students a wholistic view of history. And I will emphasize skill develop focusing on critical reading/analytical skills like comparing perspectives analyzing language (bias Ethos Pathos rhetoric fallacy etc.) in order to give my students the ability to think for themselves have and seek difficult conversations and engage in critical history. We must get the Conservatism out of education; remove the false prophets of free speech and educational piety. If we don't we will begin to fall into our own historical example of memory laws and continue the trajectory towards authoritarianism begun in earnest by Trump (and his cult of personality).  GK Smith Political Scientist Author of American [Dis]Information available at Amazon.  (typed on mobile apologies for spelling/grammatical errors)  Link to the Essay: www.nytimes.com/...
