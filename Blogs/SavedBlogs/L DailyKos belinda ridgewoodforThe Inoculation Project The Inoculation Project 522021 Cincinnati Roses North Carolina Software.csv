L, The Inoculation Project 5/2/2021: Cincinnati Roses North Carolina Software, belinda ridgewoodforThe Inoculation Project, 2021-05-02, This week we’re helping bring a powerful lesson-building software product to a rural North Carolina grade school and a lab kit for a plant propagation technique to a Cincinnati STEM high school. We hope that readers who support quality public school education will help by sharing or supporting our featured projects. The Inoculation Project is an ongoing volunteer effort to crowdfund science and math projects for red-state public schools in low-income neighborhoods. As always our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that facilitates tax-deductible donations to specific vetted projects in public schools. We made good progress on this last week and I honestly thought someone else would polish it off by today. But no — they left that fun for us! Wade is a very small town indeed that sits not far outside Fayetteville. The large military installation the teacher refers to is Fort Bragg. Resources:  Help me give my students flexibility and independence in their learning with the power of the Nearpod platform. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  District No 7 Elementary School Wade North Carolina Total:  $196.66 Still Needed:  $121.66  $36.66 Teacher’s Comments from Mrs. Price: My Students:  Our small rural school sits on the outskirts of a large military installation. My students come from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and many of them have parents who are active-duty military. My students are kind yet curious and ambitious. They are keen to learn about the world around them both near and far and are excited by unique opportunities to learn. We try to provide opportunities to engage in the world from our classroom as many of the families of our students are not economically poised to provide opportunities outside of our rural community. While we gradually make our return to in-person learning we do not want to lose sight of the important gains we have made in the use of technology and becoming 21st century learners! My Project:  Nearpod is a powerful platform that allows teachers to build interactive lessons and activities within one resource. Notes resources links videos and activities can all be easily compiled into one Nearpod lesson so that students can work simultaneously with the teacher with small groups or independently. It is a great way to engage students in 21st century learning. While we all hope that the COVID-19 pandemic is winding down snow days and other unpredictable weather events make the need for students to have the capability to work at home more critical than ever! One of the few benefits of the pandemic is that the students at our school now have a 1:1 ratio of computers to students. Digital learning is now a tool that we can use daily in our 21st century classrooms and Nearpod is a perfect addition to our array of digital tools. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!  The horticulture students at this Cincinnati technical high school need to learn about an interesting plant propagation technique. We’ll help with the lab equipment and indoor mini-roses needed to make it happen. Resources:  Help me give my students Mini Roses to learn tissue culture propagation for a community service project. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  Hughes STEM High School Cincinnati Ohio Total:  $255.48 Still Needed:  $255.48  $160.48 Teacher’s Comments from Mrs. Greeley Howard: My Students:  My urban kids choose Environmental Science Plant and Horticulture or Animal Anatomy and Physiology as science classes. I have the opportunity to see them grow and develop from their first science class in 7th grade to their chosen electives in eleventh and twelfth grade. Our community is diverse yet most of our students come from a low income and high mobility city. My Project:  Flowers are a popular gift. For my urban students growing roses outside is not possible. Mini roses are a flowering plants that are primarily cultivated for gift giving that did not exist a century ago. Students would propagate miniature roses in test tubes then plant two of them in the provided pots. One of these roses are to be given away for a community service project and the other for students to keep for themselves to cultivate further and recall this learning for years to come. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!    Our long-term project from last week was completed with plenty of help from our readers! Coach Watts needed a digital microscope so he could share the video it produces with all of his North Carolina sixth-grade science students whether they are home or in the classroom and save the video and still images to look at again later. The project was Let's get Digital! He writes:  Thank you so much for your generosity of giving towards the digital microscope for my sixth-grade science classroom. This will help my students and I have a greater classroom experience for years to come! I really appreciate your willingness to contribute to this project. Thank you so so much! Also we have a teacher note from a project completed two weeks ago that was funded so near the end of last week that the teacher did not know yet. Ms. Sheffield’s North Carolina second-graders are reading on many different levels so she needed a good collection of books to have enough for everyone to be able to tackle at their current level. The project was We Love Reading! She writes: Thank you so much for what you have done for my students. I know that they are going to love reading these books and having interesting books to read as their growth continues. We will be sure to include pictures to show you how you made an impact on our learning! Your contribution has helped us so much!  In September of 2018 Ms. Rymer wanted her sixth-grade science class in rural Tennessee to do a water-testing project checking local water from the tap and outdoor sources for pollution and water quality. She was hoping to raise their awareness of the importance of water and of protecting water resources. The project was What's In Our Water? (More photos at the link.)  My students were so excited to receive our water testing kits in the mail. They thought it was so surprising that people that we do not know personally would care enough to help them learn in a hands-on way. I waited to use the kits until it fit with the lesson we were studying but they asked multiple times when we were doing our experiment. We recently used the water testing kits that you helped us obtain. We were discussing water pollution in our science class and how contaminants can end up in our drinking water. We used the water kits first to test the levels of various chemicals in our drinking water at school. I even learned something new during our pH tests. All of the students used the same water and it turned a yellowish green color except for one student who's water turned grey. Together we discovered that the pH of this student's water was different because she used a different temperature of water. Overall the levels of chemicals in our water were normal. Next we tested local pond and lake water using the kits. There were plenty of tablets to test for ammonia nitrate dissolved oxygen and pH of these water samples. Students were excited to see some different results than those we found when we tested drinking water. We used the accompanying curriculum to discuss what causes elevated nitrate levels (among other levels) in ponds and what this tells us about aquatic life and the health of our ecosystem. Thank you for helping me give my students this experience. I even have several tablets left so that I can repeat this experiment with my students later this year to see if the chemical levels change in the spring. THANKS AGAIN!  Founded in 2009 The Inoculation Project combats the anti-science push in conservative America by funding science and math projects in red-state classrooms and libraries. Our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a crowdfunding charity founded in 2000 and highly rated by both Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau. Every Sunday we focus on helping to fund science or math projects preferably in neighborhood public schools where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income households. We welcome everyone who supports public school education — no money is required! Finally here’s our list of successfully funded projects — our series total is 894! The success-list diary also contains links and additional information about DonorsChoose.org.
