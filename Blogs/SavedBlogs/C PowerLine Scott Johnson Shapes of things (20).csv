C, Shapes of things (20), Scott Johnson, 2021-02-23, Yesterday we noted in part 18 that Amazon had silently removed Ryan Anderson’s book When Harry Became Sally. Steve has related observations in the adjacent post. Anderson’s book fails to conform to the woke party line now enforced by Big Tech. What does Amazon have to say about what it has done? I thought readers might be interested to know that Amazon isn’t talking — isn’t talking so far anyway (tweet below). American oligarchscheered on by leftist politiciansare conducting digital book burnings@Amazon banned a thoughtful & well researched book on a complicated issue We reached out Amazon yesterday for an explanation So far they feel no need to respond https://t.co/nqbIiS9hzx — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 23 2021   Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
