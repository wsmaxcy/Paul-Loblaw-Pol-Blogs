L, New Day Cafe: Fireworks Displays from Around the World, samanthabforNew Day Cafe, 2021-07-05, The National Geographic put together a list of the world’s best fireworks displays. I’m sharing images of a few of them. See one of the world’s most dazzling fireworks displays at Lake Biwa Japan’s largest lake where an annual festival features more than 10000 fireworks https://t.co/dfoZI0BGYn  First a brief history of fireworks:  “The story of fireworks begins in about 200 B.C. when people in Liyuan China created firecrackers by tossing bamboo stalks into pits of fire. With the advent of gunpowder pyrotechnics really took off. They lit up Europe in the Middle Ages and of course remain an integral part of Lunar New Year celebrations. Polychromatic displays became a global phenomenon soon after Italian pyrotechnicians in the 1830s leveraged metallic powders to create specific colors.” Some of the locales:  Japan’s Lake Biwa  A post shared by eto takahisa (@etou.photo) A post shared by Japan Travel Photo (@japantravelphoto)  A post shared by Nigel Ip | Arts Writer (@nigelip)  A post shared by ぐっち 🇯🇵Gifu (@tayamaguchi) Sydney Australia A post shared by Australia | Travel | Scenery (@travelingau)  A post shared by Ruth Jose (@iamqueeneruth) Paris France A post shared by Chantal Guillon Macarons (@chantalguillon)  A post shared by Shadi in Paris (@shadiography) Tainan City Taiwan A post shared by 鄭偉大 (@weida_zheng)  A post shared by EXPERIENCE TAIWAN (@experiencetaiwan.asia) Grab a celebratory cup of coffee a treat and share what’s on your mind this morning.
