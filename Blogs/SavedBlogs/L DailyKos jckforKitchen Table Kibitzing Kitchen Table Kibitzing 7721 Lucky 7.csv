L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 7/7/21: Lucky 7, jckforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-07-07, It’s the seventh day of the seventh month. Is that considered lucky? I have no idea. I suppose we’re all lucky to have made it through the last few years. Why is 7 lucky anyway? In many cultures around the world seven is considered a lucky number. This probably explains the affinity many people feel for the number seven. Some scientists and mathematicians also believe there are some interesting properties of the number itself that also make it alluring. Whether the number seven is really lucky or not is a matter of opinion. Some people believe it is but this belief may simply stem from the positive things often associated with the number. Like most beliefs associated with the concept of luck superstition plays a large role in perpetuating the belief. The number seven enjoys a long history of positive associations across many different cultures. In fact if you start looking for reasons why seven is so popular throughout history across various cultures you'll find that the number seems to appear everywhere. 7 has some weird mathematical qualities. If you start forming all of the obvious fractions - one-seventh two-sevenths three-sevenths all the way up to six-sevenths - something very interesting happens. If you work out one-of-a-seven you get a decimal 0.142857142857 and that pattern 1-4-2-8-5-7 repeats indefinitely. Okay so far so good. Work out two 7s you get 0.2857142857142857 et cetera and you basically get that same sequence 1-4-2-8-5-7 shifted along.  ...there is a mathematical notion called a happy number. To get a happy number you look at the number and you start squaring the digits and adding the answers. If you keep on doing that eventually either you'll end up with the number one or you will end up getting a sequence of numbers that cycles. It begins 4 16 37. Seven is the smallest number that gives you one. If you’re playing blackjack 21 isn’t bad either. Were you lucky today?
