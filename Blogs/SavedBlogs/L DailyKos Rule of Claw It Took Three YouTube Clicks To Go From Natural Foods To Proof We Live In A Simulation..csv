L, It Took Three YouTube Clicks To Go From "Natural Foods" To "Proof We Live In A Simulation.", Rule of Claw, 2021-07-06, I decided to do an experiment.  I have been told repeatedly that social media sends you down a “rabbit hole” and sometimes without you realizing it.  My wife had an idea.  She believes in clean eating so she asked me to go to my YouTube account and sign in as a guest.  I did so.  She then asked me to look up “natural foods.”  I did that as well. It took me to this person who seemed all in all a pleasant sort and harmless.  This stuff is a cottage industry so I don’t take it as face value.  Nonetheless I did not detect anything subversive. After that the algorithm recommended this:  I watched just long enough to register it in YouTube’s memory.  I don’t really have a lot to say about this except it led me to this:  Now here Dr. Hansen goes out of his way to tell us this is rare and he is not specifically attacking the vaccines.  But the comment section is a complete dumpster fire.  Rife with misinformation with universal “iikes” and every post is anti-vaccine.  I do not believe this is random.  This looks quite organized and with a purpose.  And that video led me to this:  I did not look at this video.  But apparently they are people making a claim that human life is a computer program run by a higher intelligence and that we are not real. To these people my blood is fake my cancer is fake and I am just a figment of someone else’s programming.  Another version of this is something like “We died in 2012 and we all live on a server now.” Alrighty then. And I am not the first to notice this rabbit hole click through. How many clicks through YouTube’s “Up Next” recommendations does it take to go from an anodyne PBS clip about the 116th United States Congress to an anti-immigrant video from a designated hate organization? Thanks to the site’s recommendation algorithm just nine. The video in question is “A Day in the Life of an Arizona Rancher.” It features a man named Richard Humphries recalling an incident in which a crying woman begged him not to report her to Border Patrol though unbeknownst to her he had already done so. It’s been viewed over 47000 times. Its top comment: “Illegals are our enemies  FLUSH them out or we are doomed. ” ..That YouTube can be a petri dish of divisive conspiratorial and sometimes hateful content is well-documented. Yet the recommendation systems that surface and promote videos to the platform's users the majority of whom report clicking on recommended videos are frustratingly opaque. YouTube's Up Next recommendations are algorithmically personalized the result of calculations that weigh keywords watch history engagement and a proprietary slurry of other undisclosed data points. Four clicks so the issue is getting worse it seems.  And just why did natural foods trigger a trip into Conspiracy Junction?  My wife said it would because she noticed that her group of “organic” friends turned more extreme against masks and vaccines and more right wing which she did not see coming. I am going to be careful with YouTube because rabbit holes are a tough thing to crawl out of. Especially if you do not realize you are in one. -ROC  Hey friends my cancer fight has turned more serious and has forced me to urgently change careers!  And-huge news!  My newsletter is live! Sign up here to subscribe!  It publishes every Wednesday and will be full of original reporting laughs and fun!
