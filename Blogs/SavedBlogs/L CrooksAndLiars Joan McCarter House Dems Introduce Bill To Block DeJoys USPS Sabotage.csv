L, House Dems Introduce Bill To Block DeJoy's USPS Sabotage, Joan McCarter, 03-30-21, Postmaster Louis DeJoy has made a very powerful enemy: the U.S. Congress. Well the Democrats who control the House anyway. A  group of House Democrats has introduced the "Delivering Envelopes  Judiciously On-time Year-round Act." Yes the DEJOY Act which is a  crime against legislative nomenclature. But the lawmakers are serious  intent on blocking DeJoy from implementing the service changes he intends including slowing delivery of first-class mail to as long as five days.   "This is the best way to kill your business" Rep. Raja  Krishnamoorthi the Illinois Democrat and lead sponsor of the bill  said. "To basically say to your customers 'We're not going to meet your  expectations. You're going to meet our service realities regardless of  what ends up happening.'" Krishnamoorthi told The Washington Post  that this "particular change going from 100 percent of first-class  mail being delivered one to three days to only 70 percent would be a  nonstarter in my opinion with the American people."          DeJoy's response to Congress in a hearing  before he released his plan doomed the reception of it. While DeJoy  wasn't quite as obnoxious and insulting to members as in previous  outings he still angered many of them. DeJoy actually said  "Does it make a difference if it's an extra day to get a letter?" as if  people weren't relying on the mail to get their prescriptions to pay  their bills to receive checks. Then he had the chutzpah to say "I  would give myself an 'A' for bringing strategy and the planning and  effort to here."   It's not just Congress that is set against DeJoy. Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro threatened legal action  if DeJoy's changes "illegally come at the expense of those who rely on  the mail for everything from paychecks to medications." The Postal  Service he reminds us  is a public service and "Changes to its universal service guarantee  must go through a process that is designed to protect the public  interest." Shapiro's office told the Post  that "it was encouraged that DeJoy recognizes the legal obligations to  secure limited regulatory approvals but said it remained concerned  about timely mail delivery."   DeJoy wants to slash service cut USPS post office hours and  increase postage costs for consumers delivering worse service for  higher cost in his attempt to save $160 billion over 10 years. That's  along with legislation from Congress that is likely to pass that will  repeal the 2006 law forcing the USPS to pre-fund retiree health benefits  75 years in advance. It's the only agency that Congress has ever  required to do that a decision made when cooking the books to make the  deficit look better.   The USPS is an off-budget entity—its operating expenses don't come  out of the Treasury but its payments into the federal health benefits  system do so this intergovernmental agency pumping funds in for retiree  health benefits could be counted as revenue for the federal government.  It was so much book-cooking but had real consequences in burdening the  USPS. Rep. Carolyn Maloney chair of the House Oversight and Reform  Committee has legislation that would both repeal the 2006 law and  enroll future retirees in Medicare. They're now in the federal employees  benefits plan where all that pre-funding money has been going.   DeJoy's planned price hikes and service cuts are getting panned by  consumer groups—including business groups that rely on the mail. There  are lawsuits in the works to force a stop to the changes. "In the entire  fifty-eight pages of the plan there does not appear to be any effort to  retain mail volume" PostCom a national postal commerce advocacy  group wrote. "Apart from price increases and service reductions there  is little about mail in the plan at all. That's inaction." Another  group the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers said "the plan will drive mail  volume down to levels not seen since before it reached 100 billion in  1980. […] If we mailers win our federal lawsuit the plan is sunk."   DeJoy has to be stopped before he can implement these changes. He should have been gone before now—when his disqualifying conflicts of interest  surfaced. The fact that the USPS Board of Governors picked DeJoy—who  was unqualified had never worked in the Postal Service and who got the  job after making big donations to Trump's convention—without any  vetting process means they have to go too.   Biden should fire the board. The Senate should make confirming  Biden's new board members a top priority. The Postal Service is too  critical an institution to let this malfeasance continue.
