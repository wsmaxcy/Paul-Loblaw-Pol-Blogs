L, leave the dumb take the Capone: Trump Organization & CFO indictment still just the beginning, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-06-30, The first indictments have been returned in New York. The bulk of the case against Trump’s company likely will be handled by DA Cyrus Vance Jr’s successor. “During his MSNBC show tonight Lawrence O’Donnell revealed that even ahead of tonight’s indictment of Allen Weisselberg Trump has been refusing to be alone in a room with him. Whenever the two have recently met or spoken a third party has always been in the room.” Allen Weisselberg is expected to surrender Thursday morning at the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D) two people familiar with the plan said. He is expected to be arraigned later in the day in front of a state court judge. The Trump Organization will also be arraigned represented in court by one of its attorneys.  [...]Trump himself is not expected to be charged this week the people said and no others in his orbit are expected to face imminent charges. But the indictments could mark a significant escalation in his legal problems — both by exposing his company to potential fines and by raising the pressure on Weisselberg. Prosecutors hope Weisselberg will offer testimony against Trump in exchange for lessening his own risk according to another person familiar with the case. www.washingtonpost.com/...  The indictments will be unsealed tomorrow and we can finally see the evidence that the Manhattan DA believes he has against Trump Org. https://t.co/zokmf5AHhI  He's too modest to tell you this so I will: the NY State lawsuit against the Trump Foundation wouldn't have happened without the Pulitzer Prize winning journalism of @Fahrenthold which I devoured in real time in 2016.   NY prosecutors to indict Trump Org insider - but not Trump sources sayPeople familiar with case said prosecutors are preparing criminal charges against Trump Org chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg & considering criminal charges against the companyhttps://t.co/pkHsApG5MU  Initial charges by Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr will focus mainly on whether Weisselberg and other company officials received corporate perks and benefits such as rent-free apartments and leased cars that were not reported properly on their tax returns.

Read the fine print on any loan. Donald Trump is the biggest loser in American history. He's getting what he deserves.  Reminder that Esper was among the group of every living former defense secretary who publicly warned the military that getting involved in the election was in fact illegal and possibly a crime. Why? Because they knew Trump would try to use the military to stay in power. https://t.co/7lpEOfFPlV   Just think if Donald Trump were president during this unprecedented heat wave he could be telling us it really wasn't hot  We have never in modern times seen criminal charges like this against an ex-president’s business. This is not the end only the end of the beginning for Trump’s legal troubles as I explained to @JohnBerman tonight on @AC360 @CNN. pic.twitter.com/pIBRBffFPA  Then there’s this bit of disinformation: Who shot Ashli Babbitt the pro-Trump Air Force veteran who was killed by police during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol building? The American people were told that it was a Capitol Police officer who fired the fatal shot. But Cockburn has stumbled across some information that points to a different explanation. Sources close to and within the intelligence community tell Cockburn that Babbitt was actually shot by a member of then-vice president Mike Pence’s protective detail. The VP’s detail of course is provided by US Secret Service not the Capitol Police. One person asserted to Cockburn over drinks in DC that this is ‘basically an open secret’ in the intelligence community. Law enforcement sources suggested to Cockburn that the Capitol Police Department and Department of Justice have publicly identified the shooter as a Capitol Police officer in order to protect the reputation of the Secret Service. Cockburn also wonders if this isn’t an attempt to protect Pence from further anger or threats from Capitol rioters who wanted him to refuse to certify the results of the election on January 6. spectatorworld.com/... If you don't think that the Cosby release was strategically timed to distract from the 1/6 select committee vote and tomorrow's pending criminal charges against the Trump org....You haven't been paying attention for the past 6 years.  I have said it before and I have been wrong but I think tomorrow will be the beginning of the destruction of this madman who has destroyed so much and killed so many.  It will take time however but the ball starts rolling  finally.
