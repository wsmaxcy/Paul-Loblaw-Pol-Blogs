L, Mikayla's Missing Police Reports, Nancy Groutsis, 2021-05-10, Since the Hopkinton Police didn’t log the assault against Mikayla Miller on April 17th or the discovery of her body on April 18th I’m going to write fictional versions of the reports: April 17     7:20 pm A caller reported an assault against her daughter at a Revolutionary Way apartment building. Officer Mary Smith responded and took a report. She located the offenders and arrested them. April 18     7:45 am A caller reported finding a youth’s body at the Berry Acres Conservation Area. Sergeant Greg Iverson and Officer Bethany Clark responded and notified the parent who resides in Hopkinton. A report from the DA’s office will follow. It takes about 1 minute to write each log. This is standard procedure and the log is published in the town paper. I know this because I often read police logs when I lived in Hopkinton. This is an example of a typical day’s log for October 17 2018: Arrests/Police Log Nov. 8 editionOctober 17     10:08 a.m. A caller complained about a tree company working on West Elm Street without a detail officer present. Officer John Corridan responded and spoke with the workers and advised them to stay in the road while working.     12:20 p.m. A caller reported an IRS phone call scam and wanted the incident logged.     10:46 p.m. Officer Moira McGaffigan found an open door at a Church Street building checked the area and secured the building.  I published this to show that the police log small incidents. The first incident was that a person was very concerned that gardening was being done without police supervision. The second incident was a phone fraud warning. The final incident shows how concerned Hopkinton Police are about anything that is even slightly suspicious. Officer McGaffigan didn’t see any crime. She merely saw an open door. She walked to the church shut the door and then wrote a log about shutting the door. That was the biggest problem she saw in Hopkinton that day: an open door. Now that I have shown you a typical day’s police log in Hopkinton MA I hope you realize how cold-hearted and I guess illegal it was for the Hopkinton police to refuse-and that’s what it was refusal not negligence-to log the assault against Mikayla Miller that caused physical injury to her and the next day to again refuse to give her basic human respect to log the discovery of her body. Not only was this a wrong committed against a racial minority and child but it was also deceitful and harmful to every Hopkinton town resident to fail to notify them of danger lurking in the town.
