L, U.S. Senator Barrasso:  Republicans DEMAND Skinny Infrastructure Bill With NO LINKAGE., Merlin196357, 2021-06-27, Republican U.S. Senator John Barrasso of WY stated that Senate Republicans are DEMANDING that there be no linkage between passage of the skinny infrastructure bill and a reconciliation crafted infrastructure plan. Barrasso claims that he has talked to the Republican senators in that — cough cough gag — “bipartisan” group that came up with a tentative dea on infrastructure and they are in “no way” going to support the skinny bill if it is linked “to that freight train of socialism.”  I would take what Barrasso says with a Mount Everest amount of salt. First up Barrasso is trying to one up Moscow Mitch with his immortal words of “making Obama a one term president.”  Barrasso wants to make Joe Biden “one-half-term president.”  Therefore I think we can safely assume that Barrasso does not have good intentions with regards to Joe Biden’s political future.  And most of what he says can be tossed into the nearest Republican created cesspool. The Barrasso went on Fox to deliver this ultimatum to Joe Biden and the Democrats.  And we know that Fox is always there to challenge their Republican guests.  I’m hoping you can just the waves of sarcasm flowing through your monitor right about now. Sen. John Barrasso argued during an exclusive interview on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" that "there’s no way" Republicans are going to support the nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package "if it is any way linked and connected to" the broader Democratic spending package which the Wyoming senator called a "freight train heading towards socialism."… Speaking with Bartiromo on Sunday Barrasso said he spoke to "a number of members of the bipartisan group" and "they are all reluctant now to move forward."  "They’re going to need more assurances from the president that there is no link no connection between the bipartisan bill and this bill that the Democrats want to do" he continued adding that he believes Democrats will try to use reconciliation on the $6 trillion bill. Democrats have been negotiating the potential infrastructure bill with Republicans aiming to get at least 10 of them on board to clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold. But they've kept the idea of revisiting the previous 2021 budget reconciliation measure in their back pocket in case a deal cannot be reached and they want to get around the filibuster to pass a Democrats-only bill. "But that’s going to be a high wire act for them with no safety net" Barrasso went on to say. "There’s not going to be a single Republican in the House or Senate who’s going to vote for it." Barrasso said that "they’re going to be left to try the get every Democrat in the Senate they’ll need everyone and they can only afford to lose four in the House to get this passed which is a massive tax increase including raising the death tax." Once again Republicans want the focus to be on the skinny bill which they hope to pull all those “moderate” Senate Democrats toward.  Republican thinking has been that once those Senate Democrats vote for the skinny bill they will forgo the reconciliation bill.  And they will use the spectre of “raising taxes” against the reconciliation bill to scare Senate Democrats from supporting a reconciliation bill.  Notice the old hit of “death taxes.” If you can believe Barrasso he is basically saying for all “Republicans are looking for ANY excuse to pull the rug out” from under Biden’s feet.  And I do know that is the final destination of the skinny bill.  This is right out of the Republican playbook.  Throw out demands watch Democrats try to meet those demands stall for time then claim that perfectly reasonable ideas from Republicans were shot down and vote against final passage. All Republicans need is one more Republican senator of that so called “bipartisan” group to fold.  It’s all too easy for the skinny plan to come down crashing by Republican hands.  And my money is on Jerry Moran of KS. Problems is for Republicans that Biden might have gotten the Senate Democrats to agree to support a reconciliation bill instead.  Manchin has gotten his precious skinny bill to be accepted by Biden.  And Biden is going to spend at least another few months on the two track system for passage of an infrastructure bill.  So called centrist Democrats get to tell their constituents “See.  I can work across the aisle.  And ain’t it purty!” In the end though I expect Republicans to filibuster the skinny infrastructure bill.  But if that is the game plan Democrats have an out.  And it appears they have gotten the centrist Democrats to realize this.  So DEMAND away Barrasso!  We all know you won’t be there in the end anyway.
