L, ArtKos: Saturday Painting Palooza Vol.829, boran2, 2021-07-03, Hello again painting fans.  This week I will be starting a new painting. It is Bodiam Castle UK. The photo that I'm using is seen directly below. I'll be using my usual acrylic paints on a 9x9 inch canvas panel.  I started my sketch using my usual grind duplicating the grid I made over a copy of the photo itself. Over this I have added some blue paint.  The current state of the painting is seen in the photo directly below. I'll have more progress to show you next week. See you then.
