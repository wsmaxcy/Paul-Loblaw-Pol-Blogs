L, Moondai Furkids: When the Hooman's Away..............., RosebuddearforPWB Peeps, 2021-07-05, This weekend Rose and Dad got the opportunity for a mini-vacation. We took a day trip up to Spooner Wisconsin to visit cousins at my cousin Nick’s cabin. These cousin’s are my Dad’s late brother’s children and it is always a poignant occasion to see them. He is their last link with their own Dad and he is so much like him. You can see the longing in their eyes as they talk to him.  Wow. What a day. Cousin Nick is actually a millionaire (I always knew he would be. He was an entrepreneur even as a child had like 4 paper routes and various more shady enterprises. He took me to the movies once somehow talked the cashier into letting me in on a kid’s ticket. I was 13 cutoff age for kid’s tickets was 10.) So this “cabin” is some pretty nice digs. It has a guest house and a boat launch and is nicer than most peoples’ houses. We took a boat ride in his pontoon boat. Great fun and a wonderful outing for Dad who doesn’t get out much. Also an instructive look at how the other half lives. It always amazes me how many toys people can accumulate. A little uncomfortable for a person with a social conscience. (Don’t even get me started — no Trump supporters there but it’s not what you would call a progressive bastion if you know what I mean.).  The boyz (and Dad’s dog Herbie) do NOT like it when the hoomans go out of town.  They have all been very clingy since we came back. I have had to pry various kitties off my hands while typing this. The boys have perfected the art of the drape of the body over the wrist making it hard to type. Dad’s dog Herbie has issues with 2 things: a. you didn’t take ME with b. You were with other DOGS. I can sniff them all over you. So we are in the doghouse with Herbie.   Happy Monday all! Try to stay cool today. No easy task I know. Here in MN we will get a little break in the next couple of days and some much needed rain. Yay! Hugs to all.
