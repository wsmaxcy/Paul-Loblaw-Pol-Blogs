L, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert Self-Owns With ‘Destroying Our Freedoms’ Twitter Rant, Lee Moran, 2021-04-10, Things got a little awkward for Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) in the replies to her latest bombastic tweet. The QAnon conspiracy theory-endorsing lawmaker tweeted Friday about the United States having “a political party that is laser-focused on destroying our freedoms.” “It is not only shocking but very dangerous” Boebert blustered: We live in the freest country on planet earth. The rest of the world envies our freedoms. Meanwhile we have a political party that is laser-focused on destroying our freedoms. It is not only shocking but very dangerous. Boebert was presumably talking about the Democrats following President Joe Biden’s executive orders aimed at combating gun violence which she has railed against repeatedly on social media in recent days. But as she didn’t explicitly name the party critics mockingly interpreted Boebert’s post as a ding at her own party the GOP: I know right? The @GOP sucks. We have a political party laser focused on taking rights away from minorities and it’s the QOP Last I checked the GOP was keeping ppl from voting. And that political party would be the republicans! The GQP.. Yes your party is. And congratulations to your staffer for recognizing it. Also it's a pleasure to see proper punctuation and spelling while retaining your content-free style. What's shocking and dangerous is how little you know about the rest of the world. Yet here you are freely expressing yourself. Has Lauren been reading Oscar Wilde?"I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying."- Oscar Wilde The Happy Prince and Other Stories I am old enough to remember January 6th 2021. Damn!  Does @GOPLeader know you’re slamming the @GOP ???? You sound like North-Korea. They tell that their country is best in this planet. All other countries envies them... Dangerous like being part of an insurrection? It’ll be even better with gun control!!! Yeah like making it impossible for people to vote. pic.twitter.com/JdBYA6GjFo Definition of projection Qbert. pic.twitter.com/l6hLDcQTJI tell us more about laser focus Qbert ... pic.twitter.com/9OQXDV4YHA Sometimes your freedom infringes on my freedoms I’m not so sure the rest of the world envies us...
