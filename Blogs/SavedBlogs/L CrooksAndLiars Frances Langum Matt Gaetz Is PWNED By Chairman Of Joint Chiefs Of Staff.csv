L, Matt Gaetz Is PWNED By Chairman Of Joint Chiefs Of Staff, Frances Langum, 2021-06-23, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Apparently Matt Gaetz thinks wailing about critical race theory will distract from him being under investigation for trafficking underage girls and then witness tampering about it.    During a House military budget hearing Gaetz and his Republican colleagues wanted to make the teaching of "critical race theory" in the US Military academies a thing.  It's not a thing.   And of course Republicans didn't really want an answer from witnesses on that topic they were showing off in the hopes that their outrage alone would make it onto the Fox News primetime lineup. So Democrat Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania yielded some of her time to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley to give his thoughts.  Which were perfect and went immediately viral.   And I want to understand white rage and I'm white and I want to understand it.  So what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out.  I want to maintain an open mind here and I do want to analyze it.  It's important we understand that because our soldiers sailors air marines and guardians?  They come from the American people. So it is important that the leaders now and in the future understand it.  I've read Mao Zedong. I've read Karl Marx. I've read Lenin. That doesn't make me a Communist.  So what is wrong with understanding having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend? I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States military our general officers our commissioned and noncommissioned officers of being "woke" or something else because we are studying some theories that are out there. That was started at Harvard Law School years ago and it proposed that there were laws in the United States Antebellum laws prior to the Civil War that led to a power differential with African-Americans that were three-quarters of a human thing when this country was founded.  And we had a Civil War the Emancipation Proclamation to change that and we followed up with the Civil Rights Act in 1964 -- took another 100 years to change that. I do want to know and I respect your service and [addressing Rep. Mike Waltz R FL-6] you and I are both Green Berets but I want to know.   And it matters to our military and the discipline and cohesion of the military and I thank you for the opportunity to make a comment on that. Powerful stuff. Knowledge is power and somehow we have lost sight of that in these dark times.Further this is what a leader sounds like. â€” Robert Lusetich (@RobertLusetich) June 23 2021  For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
