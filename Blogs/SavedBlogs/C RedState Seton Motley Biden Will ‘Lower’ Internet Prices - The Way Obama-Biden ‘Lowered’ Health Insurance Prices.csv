C, Biden Will ‘Lower’ Internet Prices - The Way Obama-Biden ‘Lowered’ Health Insurance Prices, Seton Motley, 2021-04-19, Hint: Obama-Biden did no such thing. Remember the “Affordable Care Act?”  Colloquially known as Obamacare? Remember all the promises made as pretense to get it passed? Flashback: Obama REPEATEDLY Promises Obamacare Will Lower Premiums $2500 Per Year 36 Times Obama Said You Could Keep Your Health Care Plan Obama: ‘If You Like Your Doctor – You Can Keep Your Doctor’ Montage Democrats then jammed us with Obamacare – in what is now a familiar fashion. Obamacare Passed with Reconciliation Which Biden cheered – in true Biden fashion. ‘A Big F—-ing Deal’: Biden’s Health Care Reform F-Bomb on Live TV (Video) It was a “big f—-ing deal.”  In exactly the opposite way Obama-Biden and their fellow liars all promised us. Obamacare Premiums Skyrocket Millions of Americans Are Losing Their Health Plans Because of Obamacare The Obamacare lies were so blatant and so awful – even the guy who designed the awful thing had to admit it. Obamacare Architect: Yeah We Lied to The ‘Stupid’ American People to Get It Passed The Obamacare lies were so blatant and so awful – even Big Media had to admit it. Obama’s ‘Keep Your Plan’ Promise Labeled ‘Lie of the Year’ The liars who lied to us had at least one really good public chortle at our exorbitant expense. (‘Journalist’) Charlie Rose Obama Speechwriters Laugh About Obamacare Lie They all knew they were lying their faces off.  Rendering this perhaps the most insincere proffering ever proffered. President Obama Apologizes for ObamaCare But no matter how awful the results – no one on the Left will never give up the ghost. Obama’s Enduring Legacy: The Concept of Universal Coverage Never mind that more people lost their much cheaper coverage because of Obamacare – than acquired much more expensive coverage because of Obamacare. Speaking of Democrat lies “universal coverage” and “lower prices”…. Biden Infrastructure Plan Promises 100% US Internet Coverage and Lower Prices This Biden? Biggest Lie of the Night? Joe Biden Says No One Lost Their Health Insurance Under Obamacare Yes – that Biden. Biden Promises Affordable Internet for All Americans: “According to a fact sheet the White House released on Wednesday the administration’s goal is to give all Americans access to high-speed internet that is both affordable and reliable.” Well that sounds nigh identical to the Obamacare lies from the Obama-Biden White House. Access to Quality Affordable Health Care: Progress and Promise of the Affordable Care Act All the Democrat lies aside We the People knew (or should have known) government-medicine Obamacare would fail – because previous iterations of government medicine had failed. Medicare Faces Unfunded Liability of $38.6 Trillion Obamacare only made it oh-so-much-worse. Obamacare Could Produce $100 Trillion Medicare Shortfall And then came Biden. Biden’s Stimulus Gamble: Massive Cuts to Medicare So why on Earth would we take Biden seriously about “affordable and reliable” Internet access?  When we already know government Internet is terrible? Broadband Boondoggles – Failed Taxpayer-Funded Networks: “For decades local governments have made promises of faster and cheaper broadband networks. Unfortunately these municipal networks often don’t deliver or fail leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. Explore the map to learn about the massive debt waste and broken promises left behind by these failed government networks.” We have decades’ worth of many hundreds of examples of government being awful at providing Internet access.  We don’t need to do this yet again. But Biden presses on – utterly undaunted by facts. Telling nigh the exact same lies about government Internet – he and his told about government health insurance. Those of us who do not know history – are doomed to look really REALLY stupid all over again. The rest of us just get royally screwed – yet again.
