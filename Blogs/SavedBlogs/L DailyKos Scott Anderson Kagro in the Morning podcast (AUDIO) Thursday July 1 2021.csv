L, Kagro in the Morning podcast (AUDIO): Thursday July 1 2021, Scott Anderson, 2021-07-01,  Tragic news. Donald Rumsfeld died on my day off and everybody used up all the good jokes already. Rumsfeld won’t be somewhat north of anything anymore and now can be fondly remembered as someone who will be in no one’s presence ever again. America’s Rapey Dad Bill Cosby is not the architect of the deaths of half a million people and also unfortunately is still with us even more so now that an attorney screwed up. David Waldman and Greg Dworkin interrupted their Canada Day celebrations to bring us that news today and also because Canada Day isn’t one of those holidays that one celebrates anymore. You know who’s likewise still alive? Yes Donald Trump was delighted that charges have been brought against his business and CFO. All of those people are not him after all. Donald is miffed that his 4th of July Trump celebration was cancelled however. Nancy Pelosi and the House have voted to create a select committee on the January 6 Capitol insurrection. It was a bipartisan vote and those two Republicans that voted for it will probably get an invite. That leaves a few more Republicans to assign and Kevin McCarthy vows to give them the stink-eye if they accept. Adam Kinzinger tells Kevin to bring it on. The next move is McCarthy’s and then the checkmate will be Pelosi’s. Kyrsten Sinema once called Joe Lieberman “Pathetic” but has since been seduced by Joe’s innate charm. Al Gore demands that Donald Trump not behave so crazy.  New Pew data show that Joe Biden made large gains with people Donald Trump regularly offended. The Supreme Court did just what everyone expected they would do to voting rights upholding restrictions and protecting big donors.  Justice Elena Kagan had about 41 pages of problems with that. New York City’s Board of Elections ruined the reputation of ranked choice voting and general voting integrity when it was really their reputation that deserved it. A Michigan Republican spent eight months searching for evidence of election fraud and returned with common sense.  South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem will send 50 National Guard troops to join the 3600 already there. To save South Dakotans money the South Dakotans in Texas will be paid by a Tennessean who in turn will be paid by anybody he wants. The Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad attempted to destroy a seized cache of 5000 pounds of illegal fireworks eventually succeeding.
