L, WOW2: Early May’s Trailblazing Women and Events in Our History - May 1-8 2021, officebssforThis Week in the War on Women, 2021-05-08,  WOW2 is now a four-times-a-month sister blog to This Week in the War on Women. This edition covers women and events from May 1 through May 8. The next WOW2 edition will post on Saturday May 15. The purpose of WOW2 is to learn about and honor women of achievement including many who’ve been ignored or marginalized in most of the history books and to mark moments in women’s history. It also serves as a reference archive of women’s history. There are so many more phenomenal women than I ever dreamed of finding and all too often their stories are almost unknown even to feminists and scholars. May is National Women’s Health Month sponsored by the Society for Public Health Education which has projects in 97 communities in the U.S. many in partnership with the American Heart Association the American Planning Association and the National WIC Association. will post shortly so be sure to go there next andcatch up on the latest dispatches from the frontlines.

I hope you will find reclaiming our past as much of an inspiration as I do.   _________________________________   May 1 1783 – Phoebe Hinsdale Brown born considered the first notable American woman hymnwriter; known for her hymn “I love to steal awhile away” based on her daily trip away from her house at a certain hour for meditation and prayer. The well-beaten path to the woods was discovered and she was ridiculed by a thoughtless neighbor woman so she tearfully wrote the hymn that night. Brown’s original poem included her domestic cares but they were removed by Reverend Ashale Nettleton from the lyrics when the hymn was published. _________________________________  _________________________________   _________________________________  _________________________________  _________________________________  _________________________________  _________________________________  ________________________________ _________________________________
