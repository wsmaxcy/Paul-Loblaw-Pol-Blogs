L, What's For Dinner? v15.43 - Index of Pickles Preserves Condiments and Sauces, esquimauxforWhat's for Dinner, 2021-05-01, I’m including tonyahky’s outstanding Pickling and Canning diaries in the index even though they weren’t originally published to WFD because they’re such good references on the subject. This is Part 13 of the index; Part 14 will be Summer Holidays and Fall Holidays. After that I will do a couple chapters of International/Ethnic recipes by region and then the index will be done! -—   This afternoon I’ll be playing in a band for the first time since last February! I haven’t made a plan for dinner I’ll probably get takeout. What’s for dinner at your place? What’s for Dinner? is a Saturday evening get-together where friends share recipes talk about good food and help others answer culinary questions. We welcome you to our virtual table every Saturday evening 4:30 PT/7:30 ET. If you would like to write a post for an upcoming date just send a message to ninkasi23!
