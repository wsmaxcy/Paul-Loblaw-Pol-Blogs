L, America Was No More Great In the Past Than Your Childhood Was a Blooming Garden of Eden., rickbramhall, 2021-07-03, I’ve found that almost all humans suffer from nostalgia. One of the only virtues of chronic major depression is that I don’t have this problem. However since it is so prevalent I suspect there must be some benefit from this peculiar detachment from past reality. This is just unqualified speculation but maybe nostalgia exists so that old people don’t kill themselves when reviewing their pasts. It is just this kind of misremembering that caused the Make America Great Again movement. Just as riding in cars without seatbelts drinking out of garden hoses and riding bikes without helmets were not good ideas neither was racism sexism nor the House Un-American Activities Committee. My fellow senior citizens from the Boomer generation conveniently forget that we were told we’d survive a nuclear attack if we ducked and covered under our school desks. One of the reasons I chose to teach 8th grade was that I remembered how horrible junior high was for me and most of my peers. I was hoping to make it a little bit better for my students. It was nice getting validation in this from a college professor of psychology who understood how tough adolescence is in the Euro-centric world. Where I was disappointed in not getting validation was among my students’ parents. Not a single one of them seemed to accurately remember their own past. Yes there are always one or two goody-two-shoes who never caused problems for their parents while in their teens but — I swear — I never knew any of them. “I don’t understand” parents would tell me “just a few years ago this was a loving family-centered child who loved spending time with their parents. Now they care more about their friends and their opinions than mine.” I would tell them over and over that this was normal but they didn’t believe me. Maybe the United States is going through its adolescence? That would explain a lot. Then again we may be in our dotage. This sugar-coating of the past is a main reason young people don’t believe us when we talk about the past or about history in general. Those that do fall for this gag are just that much more unprepared to deal with the future. The only way things are going to get better is for us to admit that they need to get better. And while we’re at it let’s begin to get rid of this idea that the United States of America is America and that only its citizens are Americans. But don’t get me started. That’s an entirely separate rant.
