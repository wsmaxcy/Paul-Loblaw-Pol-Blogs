L, OH-Gov & Sen: Nan Whaley (D) Hits Back At J.D. Vance's (R) Bull S*** Lies About Universal Pre-K, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-29, Received this e-mail from Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley’s (D. OH) gubernatorial campaign:  We don't need some hedge fund millionaire like @JDVance1 claiming to speak for working families who are struggling to get by.In Dayton we passed universal pre-k and the results have been incredible both for kids and families. https://t.co/Qdj5jDKmJd  Last night Joe Biden announced his plan for universal preschool. Having passed universal pre-K for every four year old in Dayton I know there is no better investment in our state’s future we can make than in improving our kids’ education and I’m glad this issue is finally getting the national attention it deserves. But Republican J.D. Vance who’s eyeing a run for office in Ohio tweeted last night “Universal child care’ is a massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class.” Here’s the reality: In Dayton universal pre-K has led to huge improvements for our kids AND economic opportunity for families. I don't have time for venture fund millionaires who don't have any idea what families in Dayton have to deal with. Add your name to join me in telling J.D. Vance to come to Dayton and talk to working families about the huge difference universal preschool has made. J.D. Vance is just wrong. Already universal preschool is leveling the playing field for working class kids in Dayton and helping to close the achievement gap while providing working parents with the child care they need. I fought for universal preschool because I believe you should be able to get a good education in Ohio no matter what zip code you live in or how much money your parents make. When I’m Governor I’ll work to make sure that’s a reality across our entire state. Thank you Nan Click here to add your name. Here’s some more news about Whaley’s campaign: ‘ Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley’s newly launched campaign for governor didn’t wait long to flex its support from among Ohio Democrats announcing endorsements Wednesday from more than half the Democrats in the state legislature. The outpouring of support from the 23 lawmakers – 21 House members and two state senators – marks the first major wave of endorsements in next’s year Democratic primary for Ohio governor. Besides Whaley who launched her campaign Monday the only other major Democrat so far to publicly plan a run is Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley. Most of the lawmakers endorsing Whaley are from the Cleveland Columbus Toledo or Dayton areas; none of them are from Cranley’s home turf in Southwest Ohio. In addition to the list of current lawmakers Whaley also touted endorsements from two Democratic former state representatives: Randi Clites of Ravenna and Dan Ramos of Lorain. Overall Democrats hold 35 of 99 Ohio House seats and eight of 33 Ohio Senate seats. And over on the Senate side Vance is in the pocket of Peter Thiel: Silicon Valley iconoclast Peter Thiel is placing the biggest political bet of his career pumping $10 million into a super PAC that is supporting a former Thiel aide who may run for the US Senate in Ohio. Thiel has cut a check of just over $10 million to an outside group backing J.D. Vance the author of the bestselling book Hillbilly Elegy a much bigger contribution than he made to support Donald Trump and Thiel’s largest disclosed political donation ever. Vance is one of several people in Thiel’s network who have weighed Senate bids in recent years and stand to benefit substantially from their ties to the billionaire investor. The donations are the latest display of how Thiel is cultivating a network of young populist Ivy League-educated proteges and encouraging them to run for Senate all around the country. Vance’s book turned him into a literary and cultural sensation after the 2016 election especially for Democrats who were seeking clues about the working-class white voters that powered Trump to victory. The book a memoir about Vance’s upbringing in Ohio and Kentucky was recently made into a Netflix film. Of course Vance has to compete against this garbage person: Controversial U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel are among the confirmed speakers for an event at the Ohio Statehouse Saturday to honor the law enforcement community. The “Back the Blue Freedom Rally!” is scheduled for the West Lawn from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. according to promotional information posted by Ohio Gun Owners which is organizing the event. “I think it’s high time (that we let) the law enforcement community know that the regular law-abiding community has their backs we definitely support them” said Chris Dorr executive director of the group. “We didn’t want them to be forgotten so it’s a good time to throw a rally in support of them.” And then there’s her: Seeking to distance herself from former Ohio Gov. John Kasich Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jane Timken erroneously claimed on conservative radio that she never donated to his 2016 presidential campaign. The assertion came in a race where an endorsement from former President Donald Trump a favorite target of Kasich’s attacks could be potentially pivotal. The Republican ex-president twice carried Ohio by more than 8 percentage points. Timken brought up the donation issue while pushing back Friday against a characterization by conservative talk show host Bob Frantz that she was “a huge Kasich fan” and has a “back and forth going there with respect to true conservatives and Republicans In Name Only.” Timken who ousted Kasich’s hand-selected Ohio GOP chair in 2017 after Trump personally intervened to back the takeover rushed to squelch the suggestion saying of Kasich “I never donated (to) or supported his presidential campaign.” Campaign finance reports show Timken not yet the head of the Ohio Republican Party at the time contributed the maximum $2700 to Kasich’s presidential run in February 2016. Her husband Ward J. “Tim” Timken Jr. then the CEO of TimkenSteel donated the same amount the same day. Meanwhile on Team Blue it’s official:  Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan launched his Senate campaign on Monday betting that the state that turned red in the Trump era can return to the Democratic party in 2022.  I'm running for U.S. Senate to fight like hell to cut workers in on the deal. pic.twitter.com/O1hkLdS1up  Rep. Tim Ryan a Niles Democrat reported raising more than $1 million in the first quarter of 2021 a significant boost over his previous fundraising as he openly mulls a bid for Senate. In a release Ryan’s campaign said he raised $1.2 million in the first three months of 2021 and currently has $1 million in the bank. Of those donations 88% were from small-dollar donors of $200 or less. “Grassroots support for Tim Ryan continues to grow as Ohioans recognize a strong and authentic leader who fights every day to cut workers in on the deal” said Dennis Willard spokesman for Tim Ryan for Congress. Ryan’s campaign noted in the release that the $1.2 million raised is more than double the previous high of $586000 raised during the third quarter of 2020 and accounts for 60% of the nearly $2 million raised that cycle.  Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) on Wednesday rolled out endorsements from 10 unions for his Senate campaign touting his support among labor groups in his effort to flip the open seat currently held by Sen. Rob Portman (R). Ryan in a press release announced he’d won the backing of a slew of unions including three chapters of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees; Communication Workers of America District 4; International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 6; Maritime Engineers Beneficial Association; Ohio State Conference of IBEW; Ohio Association of Professional Firefighters; and two chapters of the International Association of Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Workers. “I come from a union family and I’m proud to have spent my life standing with the men and women of organized labor” Ryan said. “I’m honored to be launching this campaign with the support of unions across Ohio.“Whether it’s passing the PRO Act or making sure our retirees get the pensions they’ve earned putting people to work rebuilding our roads and bridges or making sure Ohioans have the skills they need to compete and win I’ll never stop fighting to cut our workers in on the deal” he added referencing legislation before Congress that would make it easier for workers to unionize. He have decent shots in both these races and we need to get ready now.
