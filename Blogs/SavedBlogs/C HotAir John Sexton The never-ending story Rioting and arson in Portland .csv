C, The never-ending story: Rioting and arson in Portland , John Sexton, 2021-04-17, There was a fatal police shooting at a park in Portland Friday morning. It started when a call was placed to police reporting a white man pointing a gun in the park. Police arrived and according to a witness who filmed the encounter the man became irate. He was shirtless and didn‚Äôt appear to be armed at that point though the witness said he‚Äôd seen him with a gun earlier. Police attempted to issue orders and locate then gun but when the man bent down to pick something off the ground one of the officers shot him. The man died at the scene. As many as 250 protesters showed up at the park Friday morning while police created a line of officers to keep people out of the scene. ‚ö†Ô∏èPROFANITY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è Happening now at Lents Park #protest #portland #PortlandProtests #police @KOINNews pic.twitter.com/JRJz2ZBtVM ‚Äî Jenny Young (@jennytyoung) April 16 2021  Friday evening there were two protests announced.

A group of protesters in downtown Portland lit fires smashed the windows of businesses a church and the Oregon Historical Society and caused other various damage during a destructive demonstration Friday night and early Saturday. Someone also fired several gunshots from a car traveling a block away from the protest crowd early Saturday. No one was hurt. Police declared the demonstration a riot late Friday marking the third time in five days the bureau had made such an announcement. Of course the written word doesn‚Äôt fully communicate the scale of the damage. There was lots of vandalism and broken windows.
