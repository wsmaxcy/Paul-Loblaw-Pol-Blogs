C, CNN: Biden Stares Down Putin!, John Hinderaker, 2021-06-16, Our reporters are determined to avert their eyes from Joe Biden’s mental and physical condition and pretend that all is well.

This seriously is how CNN reports on national security! You can’t make this stuff up. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
