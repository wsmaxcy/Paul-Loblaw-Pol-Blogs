L, How do you feel about “Faculty Lounge” politics? Does the Democratic Party have a wokeness problem?, Nonlinear, 2021-04-27, I just stumbled on Sean Illing’s interview with James Carville on Vox. In it he decries something he calls “faculty lounge”. Here is the actual quote.  Honestly if we’re just talking about Biden it’s very difficult to find something to complain about. And to me his biggest attribute is that he’s not into “faculty lounge” politics. “Faculty lounge” politics? You ever get the sense that people in faculty lounges in fancy colleges use a different language than ordinary people? They come up with a word like “Latinx” that no one else uses. Or they use a phrase like “communities of color.” I don’t know anyone who speaks like that. I don’t know anyone who lives in a “community of color.” I know lots of white and Black and brown people and they all live in ... neighborhoods. There’s nothing inherently wrong with these phrases. But this is not how people talk. This is not how voters talk. And doing it anyway is a signal that you’re talking one language and the people you want to vote for you are speaking another language. This stuff is harmless in one sense but in another sense it’s not. Is the problem the language or the fact that there are lots of voters who just don’t want to hear about race and racial injustice? We have to talk about race. We should talk about racial injustice. What I’m saying is we need to do it without using jargon-y language that’s unrecognizable to most people — including most Black people by the way — because it signals that you’re trying to talk around them. This “too cool for school” shit doesn’t work and we have to stop it.  Carville goes on to claim the Democratic Party has a “wokeness” problem.  Sounds like you got a problem with “wokeness” James. Wokeness is a problem and everyone knows it. It’s hard to talk to anybody today — and I talk to lots of people in the Democratic Party — who doesn’t say this. But they don’t want to say it out loud. Why not? Because they’ll get clobbered or canceled. And look part of the problem is that lots of Democrats will say that we have to listen to everybody and we have to include every perspective or that we don’t have to run a ruthless messaging campaign. Well you kinda do. It really matters. I always tell people that we’ve got to stop speaking Hebrew and start speaking Yiddish. We have to speak the way regular people speak the way voters speak. It ain’t complicated. That’s how you connect and persuade. And we have to stop allowing ourselves to be defined from the outside. So do you practice “faculty lounge” politics? Does the Democratic Party have a problem with “wokeness?
