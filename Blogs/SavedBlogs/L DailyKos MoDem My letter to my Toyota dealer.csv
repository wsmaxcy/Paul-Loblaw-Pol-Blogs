L, My letter to my Toyota dealer, MoDem, 2021-06-30, To whom it may concern: As your records will show we bought a Toyota Prius from your dealership in 2010.  We have been taking our Prius to your dealership for regular maintenance since then.  We really like our Prius it is the best car we have ever owned and we really want to buy another one when the time comes.   Recent news about political donations by your parent US company has lead us to conclude that we will not replace our present Prius with another Toyota car. According to Axios Toyota leads in corporate giving to congressional Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election.  Even more appalling is the response (as cited in Axios) from a Toyota spokesperson when asked about these donations:  We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification. . . . Based on our thorough review we decided against giving to some members who through their statements and actions undermine the legitimacy of our elections and institutions. We cannot buy products from any company that believes that a vote by a politician to overturn a free and fair election is not sufficient to stop giving to that politician. If that vote had been successful the very foundation of our democratic government would have been destroyed. Until Toyota issues a retraction of this appalling position we will not buy another Toyota.  We urge you to contact your corporate office and explain how upset good customers like us are about Toyota’s disregard for fundamental democratic principles.  *************** With a slight modification I’m sending a letter to  Toyota Headquarters:P.O. Box 259001Plano TX 75025-9001  I’m looking forward to a response
