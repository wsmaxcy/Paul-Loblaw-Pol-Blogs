L, Back in the hospital with bad news. Anyway we can get a music thread going?, CameronProf, 2021-07-01, 3 days ago I was rushed back to the hospital. They're looking at possible stroke again second in under a year as well as severe chest pains.  Today I had 4 tests done...stress test eeg ct scan of 2 regions.  Needless to say I'm freaking out and full of dread.  Would you join me in posting a song or two to mellow out with?  Unfortunately I'm on my cell only so I'm unable to post one to get started.  Anything goes my taates as you might know run from. Show tunes to new wave with dance classical jazz and old country and western tossed in.  Feel free to post whatever genre is your favorite and thanks.
