L, Twin Bill Maru:  in the audience at home., truebluecitizen, 2021-06-28, Let’s talk about “Concert Movies” which are different than musicals. Musicals have a storyline propelled by music and song.  A Concert Film is a live recording of musicians performing on stage. These are 2 of the most entertaining.  The Last Waltz is the final concert by The Band with a long roster of guest performers who had some form of personal relationship with the group.  Additionally there is footage of interviews with the band members themselves alone or as a group.  American Utopia has David Byrne of Talking Heads performing on a stage with a host of musicians that are using wireless instruments so they can roam freely. Great music and fun visuals.  Tomorrow let’s look at romance.
