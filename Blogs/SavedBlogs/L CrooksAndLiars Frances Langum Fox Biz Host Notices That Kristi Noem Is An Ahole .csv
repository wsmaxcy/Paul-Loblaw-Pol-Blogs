L, Fox Biz Host Notices That Kristi Noem Is 'An Ahole' , Frances Langum, 04-16-21, South Dakota's Kristi Noem the Tomi Lahren of US governors sent out a dramatically nasty tweet even for her: South Dakota won't be taking any illegal immigrants that the Biden Administration wants to relocate. My message to illegal immigrants... call me when you're an American. â€” Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) April 14 2021 This prompted Kennedy of the Fox Business franchise to suggest that Kristi Noem call her "when you're not an a-hole." But neither Kennedy or Noem will admit that refugees those who are admitted to the US with refugee status ARE in the US legally.  It's the law.   But then there's the racism that keeps Kristi Noem marketing herself to the national Republican stage.  Also she's a total hypocrite. In nasty tweet Kristi Noem says South Dakota doesn't want "illegal immigrants" & tells immigrants "call me when you're an American."Uh AP estimates 14% of meatpacking work force in SD are undocumented immigrants.Why doesn't she call and arrest the owners of those plants? â€” Janice Hough (@leftcoastbabe) April 15 2021 Kristi Noem is of Norwegian descent. South Dakota was literally colonized by undocumented immigrants from Europe. Viborg Tabor Eureka Lake Hendricks etc. Immigrants belong in South Dakota. kick rocks u rat @govkristinoem pic.twitter.com/5pL5o9464b â€” b (@BreannaOoton) April 14 2021 Kristi Noem's message is that she's a fascist white nationalist.She thinks that will further her Republican political career so she takes every opportunity to repeat it. â€” Fascism flattened but never the webrantðŸ•º------ðŸ•º (@web_rant) April 14 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
