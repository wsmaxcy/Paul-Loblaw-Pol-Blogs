L, Overnight News Digest: “We still have time to act and salvage many of the things we care about”, MagnificoforOvernight News Digest, 2021-07-03, Here are some of this week’s top science stories: Details and links to sources below the fold. This is an open thread. Everyone is encouraged to share articles stories and tweets in your comments. Climate change has gotten deadly. It will get worse. […] In Oregon Washington and western Canada authorities are investigating more than 800 deaths potentially linked to the punishing heat. It will be months before experts know precisely how many of those deaths can be specifically attributed to climate change. But researchers who specialize in the science of attribution say they are “virtually certain” that warming from human greenhouse gas emissions played a pivotal role. It is a sign of how dangerous the climate crisis has gotten — and how much worse it can still become. […] “Climate change has loaded the weather dice against us” said Katharine Hayhoe a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy. “These extremes are something we knew were coming” she added. “The suffering that is here and now is because we have not heeded the warnings sufficiently.” NASA satellites help scientists learn where polluting microplastics go in the ocean Among the NASA satellites swirling around Earth are eight small ones that measure wind speeds and hurricanes. Turns out they can do another task: help scientists figure out where microplastics go in the ocean. Launched in 2016 NASA’s Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) measures wind speeds over oceans using radar. The constellation of satellites takes stock of ocean surface roughness — rougher waters mean higher winds. But the University of Michigan researchers who helped develop the system wondered whether their measurements could help them spot microplastics too. A Deadly Summer in the Pacific Northwest Augurs More Heat Waves and More Deaths to Come It was the most extreme heat wave on record in the Pacific Northwest. And as officials count the heat-related deaths over the next weeks it will almost certainly turn out to be one of the deadliest. […] As climate change drives up global temperatures deaths linked to extreme heat are increasing with some scientists projecting that by 2100 the number of heat deaths will match those from all infectious diseases. […] “Perhaps the most important thing for everyone to realize is that extreme heatwaves are becoming more frequent and hotter because of human-caused global warming”said University of Michigan climate researcher Jonathan Overpeck who moved from Arizona to the Midwest a few years ago partly based on his concerns about extreme heat and lack of water in the Southwest. “The devastating extremes associated with climate change” he said “are only going to get worse and worse until we halt the causes of global warming.” Drier Springs Bring Hotter Summers in the Withering Southwest A question has bothered climatologist Park Williams during the decade he’s been probing drought in the Southwest. Like other climate scientists he knew from research papers and worldwide storm patterns that a warming atmosphere is thirstier and sops up more moisture from oceans and the land. “But in the Southwest we’ve seen the exact opposite happening” said Williams an associate professor in the University of California Los Angeles’ geography department. “For the last 50 or so years we’ve actually seen the amount of water vapor molecules in the atmosphere decline” while temperatures have climbed about twice as fast as the global average. A new paper from UCLA researcher Karen McKinnon largely solved that puzzle by showing the hottest days in the summer months are getting dramatically drier as a result of the Southwestern spring heating up and leaving less moisture behind to cool the summer through evaporation. How hot is too hot for humans? Understanding wet-bulb temperatures […] In the wake of this dangerous weather event climate experts are pointing to another concept we might need to worry about: Wet-bulb temperatures. Wet-bulb temperatures are theoretical measurements that combine temperature and humidity into one value explains Rachel White an atmospheric scientist with the University of British Columbia's department of earth ocean and atmospheric sciences. Basically it's the temperature at which water stops evaporating from a wet thermometer bulb meaning it can no longer cool. "With wet bulb temperatures you can increase them in one of two ways" explains White. "You can either increase the temperature Western Canada's heat wave is 'unprecedented.' Scientists say it will become more common with climate change  […] Climate scientists are cautious about citing climate change as the cause of any specific weather event. But some say evidence suggests extreme events are intensifying and becoming more common because of global warming. "I'm shocked by this" said Simon Donner a professor of climatology at the University of British Columbia. "As a climate scientist we expect to see more extreme heat waves going forward into the future because we're adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. But this is even beyond my expectations. To have a heat wave last this long and be this hot in Canada is completely unprecedented in history." Canadian inferno: northern heat exceeds worst-case climate models […] Johan Rockström the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said the recent extreme weather anomalies were not represented in global computer models that are used to project how the world might change with more emissions. The fear is that weather systems might be more frequently blocked as a result of human emissions. “It is a risk – of a serious regional weather impact triggered by global warming – that we have underestimated so far” he said. […] The intensity of the heat in the north-west Americas this year and Siberia last year has taken many scientists by surprise and suggested extra factors may be involved in northern latitudes. One theory is that the recent temperature spike might have been caused not just by global heating but by slowing weather systems that get stuck in one place for an extended period which gives them time to intensify and cause more damage. This was an important factor in the devastation in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2018 which sat above Houston for several days rather than blowing inland and weakening. Blocked high-pressure fronts were also blamed for the blistering heatwave in Europe in 2019. Yellowstone’s most famous geyser could shut down with huge ramifications If temperatures rise 10F by the century’s end as projected Old Faithful could stop erupting and the snowpack that feeds rivers throughout the west may disappear. […] While the geyser is highly predictable – it has erupted every 44 to 125 minutes since 2000 – a new climate assessment and a recent study have revealed that rising temperatures reduced snowfall and increased rain threaten to shut Old Faithful off completely by the end of the century. […] But it is not the first time this has happened. About 800 years ago extreme heat and drought made Old Faithful come to a complete standstill for decades a shift which changed everything from what plant species grew in the area to what the land looked like. ‘We thought it wouldn’t affect us’: heatwave forces climate reckoning in Pacific north-west […] In Washington and Oregon largely liberal climate-conscious states efforts to combat global heating have long been popular. The Washington governor Jay Inslee put himself forward as the “climate candidate” during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He argued residents of the region would in the absence of federal leadership “do our part to address a global problem”. Climate conversations have generally centered on what north-westerners could do to protect the planet or other people in places at greater risk of extreme heat. But after three days of temperatures near or above 100F (38C) in Seattle – a city where residents often describe the sixth month as “June-uary” as temperatures rarely reach 80F (27C) – they’re increasingly concerned about themselves. “It felt like we’d set our Earth on fire” said Summer Stinson a 49-year-old Seattle non-profit executive. “There was a naivety that this wouldn’t affect us in the north-west” Stinson continued. Corporate studies asserting herbicide safety show many flaws new analysis finds A new analysis of more than 50 previously secret corporate-backed scientific studies is raising troubling questions about a history of regulatory reliance on such research in assessing the safety of the widely used weedkilling chemical known as glyphosate the key ingredient in the popular Roundup herbicide. In a 187-page report released on Friday researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria said a thorough review of 53 safety studies submitted to regulators by large chemical companies showed that most do not comply with modern international standards for scientific rigor and lack the types of tests most able to detect cancer risks. “The quality of these studies not of all but of many of these studies is very poor. The health authorities … accepted some of these very poor studies as informative and acceptable which is not justified from a scientific point of view” Siegfried Knasmueller the lead author of the analysis told the Guardian. Western drought brings plague of voracious grasshoppers: "They're everywhere" A punishing drought in the U.S. West is drying up waterways sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana's Phillips County more than 50 miles from the nearest town Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they're beginning to denude trees around his house. "They're everywhere" Wiederrick said. "Drought and grasshoppers go together and they are cleaning us out."Pacific Northwest bakes under once-in-a-millennium heat dome Pacific Northwest bakes under once-in-a-millennium heat dome The heat wave baking the U.S. Pacific Northwest and British Columbia Canada is of an intensity never recorded by modern humans  […] The heat is being caused by a combination of a significant atmospheric blocking pattern on top of a human-caused climate changed world where baseline temperatures are already a couple to a few degrees higher than nature intended. […] But calling it a new normal does not suffice says Mann "Some people called this a 'new normal. But it is worse than that" explained Mann. "We will continue to see more and more extreme heat waves droughts wildfires and floods as long as we continue to warm the planet through fossil fuel burning and carbon emissions." Fire season intensifies in the Brazilian Amazon feeding off deforestation So far this year 24 major fires have burned in the Brazilian Amazon covering an area of 7167 hectares (17710 acres). All of the fires were set on land previously deforested in 2020 until this week when the first major blaze was set on land cleared in 2021 according to a report by the Amazon Conservation Association’s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP). Experts are expecting this to be a bad year for fires owing to a historic drought high levels of deforestation and lack of funding for environmental law enforcement.  Deforestation soars 40% in Xingu River Basin in Brazilian Amazon A hundred and ninety-six trees per minute. That’s how fast the forest was being cleared in Brazil’s Xingu River Basin between March and April this year. A total of 29191 hectares (72132 acres) of Amazon rainforest was lost an area twice the size of New York City according to a report published this week. The area in question straddles the border between the states of Mato Grosso and Pará and is the source of the mighty Xingu River one of the main tributaries of the Amazon River. The deforestation recorded in the March-April period is 40% higher than the same period last year. The report was authored by Rede Xingu+ a network of 25 Indigenous peoples’ organizations traditional community associations and civil society institutions from across the Xingu River Basin.  Migratory birds aid the redistribution of plants to new climates The rapid pace of global warming and its effects on habitats raise the question of whether species are able to keep up so that they remain in suitable living conditions. Some animals can move fast to adjust to a swiftly changing climate. Plants being less mobile rely on means such as seed dispersal by animals wind or water to move to new areas but this redistribution typically occurs within one kilometre of the original plant. Writing in Nature González-Varo et al. shed light on the potential capacity of migratory birds to aid seed dispersal. When the climate in a plant’s usual range becomes hotter than it can tolerate it must colonize new cooler areas that might lie many kilometres away. It is not fully clear how plants distribute their seeds across great distances let alone how they cross geographical barriers. One explanation for long-distance seed dispersal is through transport by migratory birds. Such birds ingest viable seeds when eating fruit (Fig. 1) and can move them tens or hundreds of kilometres outside the range of a plant species. In this mode of dispersal the seeds pass through the bird’s digestive tract unharmed and are deposited in faeces which provides fertilizer that aids plant growth. In the case of European migratory birds for example the direction of seed dispersal will depend on whether the timing of fruit production coincides with a bird’s southward trip to warmer regions around the Equator or northward to cooler regions. Many aspects of this process have been a mystery until now. Mars's glowing auroras snapped by Hope spacecraft The United Arab Emirates’ Hope spacecraft has taken the most detailed pictures yet of the ‘discrete auroras’ of Mars. The ultraviolet emissions — seen by the orbiter’s onboard spectrometer — arise when solar wind runs into magnetic fields that emanate from Mars’s crust. Charged particles then collide with oxygen in the upper atmosphere causing it to glow. Hope formally known as the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) arrived at Mars in February and started its official science run on 23 May. The primary science goals of the 1.35-tonne US$200-million mission focus on the planet’s atmosphere not on its magnetism so the aurora images came as a bonus. “Seeing it has been just a gift” says Hessa Al Matroushi the EMM’s science lead at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai. Research team publishes groundbreaking methane synthesis discovery An interdisciplinary team of scientists from Montana State University's College of Agriculture and College of Letters and Science recently published research casting new light on a previously unknown element of the carbon cycle thanks to data collected from Yellowstone National Park over more than a decade. Tim McDermott a professor in MSU's Department of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences began studying the microbiology of Yellowstone Lake in 2007. While collecting data to analyze the lake's chemistry and the interaction of various microbes in the lake with the park's underlying thermal features McDermott noticed something seemed off. "We came across some lake water gas chemistries that didn't make a lick of sense" said McDermott. "We were seeing a lot of methane in places we didn't expect and wondering 'what's going on here?'" Color and flavor – pigments play a role in creating tasty tomatoes The flavor of a tomato is an interaction between its taste and aroma. Now researchers from Japan and the United States have revealed that the pigments that determine the colors of tomatoes also affect their flavor. In a study published this month researchers from University of Tsukuba developed a new method to rapidly measure the pigment profiles of tomatoes and used the technique to explore how pigments affect the taste and aroma of different tomato varieties. The color of tomatoes is produced by combinations of different types of pigments including carotenoids and chlorophylls. These pigments can also affect the accumulation of flavor-related compounds such as sugars which affect the taste of tomatoes and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which determine the aroma. As tomato fruits ripen from green to red the amounts of pigments and flavor-related compounds change but until now the relationship between color and flavor has been unclear. Honey bees are still dying at high rates beekeepers shows honey bees continue to die at high rates. Between April 2020 and this April losses across the country averaged 45.5 percent according to preliminary data from the Bee Informed Partnership a collaboration of researchers that has conducted the annual bee loss survey for 15 years. Bee mortality reported by 3347 beekeepers representing about seven percent of all honey bee colonies across the country was the second-highest since the survey began in 2006. Researchers say the high losses were in part because more bees die throughout the year. The Goldilocks Supernova A worldwide team led by UC Santa Barbara scientists at Las Cumbres Observatory has discovered the first convincing evidence for a new type of stellar explosion -- an electron-capture supernova. While they have been theorized for 40 years real-world examples have been elusive. They are thought to arise from the explosions of massive super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars for which there has also been scant evidence. The discovery published in Nature Astronomy also sheds new light on the thousand-year mystery of the supernova from A.D. 1054 that was visible all over the world in the daytime before eventually becoming the Crab Nebula. Historically supernovae have fallen into two main types: thermonuclear and iron-core collapse. A thermonuclear supernova is the explosion of a white dwarf star after it gains matter in a binary star system. These white dwarfs are the dense cores of ash that remain after a low-mass star (one up to about 8 times the mass of the sun) reaches the end of its life. An iron core-collapse supernova occurs when a massive star -- one more than about 10 times the mass of the sun -- runs out of nuclear fuel and its iron core collapses creating a black hole or neutron star. Between these two main types of supernovae are electron-capture supernovae. These stars stop fusion when their cores are made of oxygen neon and magnesium; they aren't massive enough to create iron. Smart technology is not making us dumber There are plenty of negatives associated with smart technology -- tech neck texting and driving blue light rays -- but there is also a positive: the digital age is not making us stupid says University of Cincinnati social/behavioral expert Anthony Chemero. "Despite the headlines there is no scientific evidence that shows that smartphones and digital technology harm our biological cognitive abilities" says the UC professor of philosophy and psychology who recently co-authored a paper stating such in Nature Human Behaviour. In the paper Chemero and colleagues at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management expound on the evolution of the digital age explaining how smart technology supplements thinking thus helping us to excel. "What smartphones and digital technology seem to do instead is to change the ways in which we engage our biological cognitive abilities" Chemero says adding "these changes are actually cognitively beneficial." ‘Sink into your grief.’ How one scientist confronts the emotional toll of climate change “I was trained to be calm rational and objective to focus on the facts” sustainability scientist Kimberly Nicholas recalls in her new book Under the Sky We Make: How to Be Human in a Warming World. But as research has increasingly revealed how climate change will forever alter the ecosystems and communities she loves she has struggled to address her feelings of sadness. “My dispassionate training” the Lund University researcher writes has “not prepared me for the increasingly frequent emotional crises of climate change” or how to respond to students who come to her to share their own grief. It’s a situation many scientists and professors are facing these days Nicholas writes. “Being witness to the demise or death of what we love has started to look an awful lot like the job description.” But Nicholas says the untimely death of a close friend helped persuade her that the only way forward was to acknowledge that “we are not going to be able to save all the things we love.” Instead she says we have to “swim through that ocean of grief … and recognize that we still have time to act and salvage many of the things we care about.” Scientists quit journal board protesting ‘grossly irresponsible’ study claiming COVID-19 vaccines kill Several reputed virologists and vaccinologists have resigned as editors of the journal Vaccines to protest its 24 June publication of a peer-reviewed article that misuses data to conclude that “for three deaths prevented by [COVID-19] vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination.” Since Friday at least six scientists have resigned positions as associate or section editors with Vaccines including Florian Krammer a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Katie Ewer an immunologist at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford who was on the team that developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Their resignations were first reported by Retraction Watch. “The data has been misused because it makes the (incorrect) assumption that all deaths occurring post vaccination are caused by vaccination” Ewer wrote in an email. “[And] it is now being used by anti-vaxxers and COVID-19-deniers as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe. [This] is grossly irresponsible particularly for a journal specialising in vaccines.” How Dangerous Is the Delta Variant and Will It Cause a COVID Surge in the U.S.? The Delta variant is here. First identified in India this more transmissible form of the novel coronavirus has spread to at least 77 countries and regions and now makes up more than 20 percent of all U.S. cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified it as a “variant of concern.” If vaccination rates fail to keep pace with its spread experts say the variant could lead to new COVID surges in parts of the country where a substantial proportion of the population remains unvaccinated. Studies to date suggest the Delta variant is between 40 and 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in the U.K.—which was already 50 percent more transmissible than the original viral strain first detected in Wuhan China. Delta has quickly become the dominant variant in the U.K. and has led to another surge in cases there despite the population’s high vaccination rate. And it is rapidly becoming more prevalent in the U.S. A preprint study which has not yet been peer-reviewed found that Delta and another variant called Gamma first identified in Brazil are rapidly replacing Alpha which had previously been the most common U.S. variant. As of June 30 estimates suggest Delta is now the country’s dominant variant according to William Lee vice president of science at the genomics company Helix who co-authored the study. “It is the most hypertransmissible contagious version of the virus we’ve seen to date for sure—it’s a superspreader strain if there ever was one” says Eric Topol a professor of molecular medicine and an executive vice president at the Scripps Research Institution. The U.S. is poorly prepared he says. Less than half of the nation’s population is fully vaccinated—and that number is much lower in some states particularly in the South and Mountain West. “We’ve been warned three times by the U.K.” Topol says referring to previous surges in early 2020 and last winter. “This time is the third warning.” AI Designs Quantum Physics Experiments Beyond What Any Human Has Conceived Quantum physicist Mario Krenn remembers sitting in a café in Vienna in early 2016 poring over computer printouts trying to make sense of what MELVIN had found. MELVIN was a machine-learning algorithm Krenn had built a kind of artificial intelligence. Its job was to mix and match the building blocks of standard quantum experiments and find solutions to new problems. And it did find many interesting ones. But there was one that made no sense. “The first thing I thought was ‘My program has a bug because the solution cannot exist’” Krenn says. MELVIN had seemingly solved the problem of creating highly complex entangled states involving multiple photons (entangled states being those that once made Albert Einstein invoke the specter of “spooky action at a distance”). Krenn Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna and their colleagues had not explicitly provided MELVIN the rules needed to generate such complex states yet it had found a way. Eventually he realized that the algorithm had rediscovered a type of experimental arrangement that had been devised in the early 1990s. But those experiments had been much simpler. MELVIN had cracked a far more complex puzzle. Johnson & Johnson says its COVID-19 vaccine protects against delta variant The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective against the highly transmissible delta variant the company announced on Thursday (July 1). Though the analysis was conducted on only a small number of participants and hasn't yet been peer-reviewed it suggests that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine like the Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines may provide a buffer for the U.S. against the highly transmissible variant. The findings were submitted as two separate studies to the preprint server bioRxiv. From drying rainforests to heavier downpours Australia’s climate is changing Australia’s tropical rainforests will dry out marine and land heatwaves will become more frequent and intense and thunderstorms will dump more rain and worsen floods as the globe heats up. These are among the many impacts from climate change that will blight the nation further unless atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases stabilise according to the final report of the federal government’s Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub. […] “It’s clear that climate change is already happening and having impacts” said David Karoly the leader of the Earth Systems Hub that ended its work on June 30. ‘Wasted so much time’: New global panel to say carbon must be pulled from atmosphere The world needs to develop new technologies to suck excess carbon dioxide out of the air because efforts to cut emissions are moving far too slowly said the only Australian-based scientist on a major new international science group. Nerilie Abram a paleoclimatologist at the Australian National University said the new Climate Crisis Advisory Group to be officially launched later on Thursday would aim to provide “the best scientific advice” on the urgency of slashing greenhouse gas emissions. “We’ve wasted so much time” Professor Abram said. “I hope that we are able to make a difference.” Why some biologists and ecologists think social media is a risk to humanity Social media has drastically restructured the way we communicate in an incredibly short period of time. We can discover “Like” click on and share information faster than ever before guided by algorithms most of us don’t quite understand. And while some social scientists journalists and activists have been raising concerns about how this is affecting our democracy mental health and relationships we haven’t seen biologists and ecologists weighing in as much. That’s changed with a new paper published in the prestigious science journal PNAS earlier this month titled “Stewardship of global collective behavior.” Seventeen researchers who specialize in widely different fields from climate science to philosophy make the case that academics should treat the study of technology’s large-scale impact on society as a “crisis discipline.” A crisis discipline is a field in which scientists across different fields work quickly to address an urgent societal problem — like how conservation biology tries to protect endangered species or climate science research aims to stop global warming. The US power grid isn’t ready for climate change In Portland Oregon this week the recorded official temperature reached 115 degrees Fahrenheit power cables for the city’s streetcars melted sagging overhead wires forced the light rail to shut down and more than 6000 people lost electricity. But it’s far from the first time extreme weather has caused serious problems with the power grid in recent months. During the winter storm that hit Texas in February nearly 5 million people lost power. In June California suggested that residents charge their electric vehicles during off-peak hours to save energy. And for the first time ever after power outages hit several neighborhoods during this week’s heat wave New York City officials sent residents an emergency mobile alert urging them to conserve energy. It’s abundantly clear that the power grid in the United States is not ready for the effects of climate change including the extreme weather events that come with it. After all climate change isn’t just increasing the demand for energy to keep people cool or warm amid heat waves and winter storms. It’s also damaging the grid itself. The country is now in a race against time to shift its energy supply toward renewable sources like wind and solar while also needing more and more electricity to do everything from powering more air conditioning to boosting the number of EVs on the road. New York Faces Blackouts as Extreme Heat Strains the Grid On Wednesday afternoon New Yorkers’ phones started shrieking as an emergency alert warned them to conserve power or face the prospect of widespread blackouts. The city along with large parts of the East Coast are blanketed under an oppressive heat wave that is taxing the electricity grid much as the record-setting West Coast heat wave did earlier this week. Amid sweltering temperatures several neighborhoods in New York City have seen electricity outages leaving more than 3000 residents without power data from New York utility company Con Edison shows. The majority of the outages occurred in Brooklyn including the largest one that affected 1700 Con Edison customers in the neighborhood of Williamsburg. In some areas Con Edison has been taking extreme measures in its attempt to keep the grid running as demand skyrockets. On Wednesday afternoon the utility reduced power voltage by 8% to some neighborhoods in the borough of Queens while crews worked to repair power equipment affecting some 64000 customers in more than a dozen neighborhoods. Grocery Stores Couldn't Handle the Pacific Northwest's Historic Heat Wave The record-setting heat wave ripping through the Pacific Northwest right now has already melted critical infrastructure killed hundreds of people across the region and closed countless schools. It came for grocers too. Insider was first to report that grocery stores across Washington state have taken extreme measures to keep up with the historic high temperatures like covering refrigerated goods with plastic or pulling perishables like meat and veggies off the shelves entirely. And that’s before store’s freezers and fridges start to malfunction from the staggering temperatures. Though the worst of the heat has passed for many regions it goes to show just how bad things were. Dinosaurs Were Already in Big Trouble Before the Asteroid More Evidence Suggests A large asteroid wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago but these formidable animals were already in decline by that point in a process that started 10 million years earlier according to new research. Paleontologists have made similar claims before but the new study presents a compelling case while also providing an explanation for the dino downturn. Dinosaurs dominated the world’s ecosystems until the Late Cretaceous but as a new paper published in Nature Communications argues a significant increase in dinosaur extinction rates combined with an inability to replace lost species brought dinosaurs to decline long before an approximately 6-mile-wide (10-kilometer) asteroid struck the Chicxulub region near what is now Mexico. Arctic’s ‘Last Ice Area’ May Be Less Resistant to Global Warming […] Scientists have now shown why ice conditions in the Wandel Sea were vastly different last summer. The warming Arctic climate thinned the ice they say and an unusual shift in winds pushed much of it out of the sea. “As it is typically with extreme events there’s an underlying climate change component” said Axel J. Schweiger a climate scientist at the University of Washington and the lead author of a paper describing the research published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment. The findings have potentially troubling implications for the Wandel Sea and nearby waters north of Canada a region often referred to as the “last ice area.” Because a circular ocean current the Beaufort Gyre tends to keep ice trapped there climate models have predicted that it will likely retain ice as warming causes the rest of the Arctic Ocean to become ice-free in summers perhaps in the next few decades. Shrinking Elephants Once Called Sicily Home Elephants today are confined to the African and Asian continents. But their extinct relatives once roamed far and wide across the planet. When they settled onto islands some species’ evolutionary course changed direction in a dramatic fashion. In a paper published earlier this month scientists found clues to just how much island living can rapidly alter the evolution of these animals. “Evolution on islands is a quite intriguing field of science since it can be seen as an experiment of nature or evolution in action” said Sina Baleka the paper’s lead author and a paleogeneticist at McMaster University in Canada. She and her co-authors hope their findings can offer insights into how species living today are affected by geographic isolation on islands and in other habitats. Modern elephants survived ancient climate change. More than 180 other species including mastodons didn’t The elephants we know and love today may be the ultimate survivors. While there are only three species of elephants now – all of which are endangered and can be found across Africa and Asia – they once belonged to a group called proboscideans that included 185 species living around the world. In the past researchers have blamed humans for hunting these animals to extinction thousands of years ago. But new research suggests that climate change is the likely culprit in the demise of prehistoric mammoths mastodons and early elephants rather than overhunting by early humans at the end of the last Ice Age. Waves of extreme global climate change chipped away at the proboscideans over time eventually causing most of them to go extinct in different parts of the world between 2 million and about 75000 years ago the researchers said. In fossilized dinosaur poop scientists find hidden beetle You might think fossilized feces are only full of crap but new research on one specimen has turned up a hidden treasure: a 230-million-year-old previously undiscovered beetle species. Named Triamyxa coprolithica the tiny beetles are also the first insects to be described from fossilized feces – or coprolites – and were visible by a scanning method that uses strong X-ray beams according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology. Besides the discovery of the beetles in a coprolite the scientific name also refers to the Triassic period which lasted from roughly 252 million to 201 million years ago and the suborder of bugs called Myxophaga – small aquatic or semiaquatic beetles that eat algae. NASA preparing to switch glitchy Hubble Space Telescope to backup hardware if needed As NASA continues to diagnose a computer glitch on the Hubble Space Telescope engineers are preparing to turn on some of the observatory's backup hardware. The main computer on the venerable telescope shut down unexpectedly on June 13; since then the operations team has been working to identify and troubleshoot the problem which is turning out to be rather elusive. More than two weeks into the process and while continuing to work to pinpoint the root cause of the issue NASA is now preparing to potentially move the telescope to backup hardware according to a statement released on Wednesday (June 30). "In parallel with the investigation NASA is preparing and testing procedures to turn on backup hardware onboard the spacecraft" agency officials wrote in the statement. "The telescope itself and science instruments remain healthy and in a safe configuration." NASA's Perseverance rover is taking its own wheel for Mars drives NASA's Perseverance rover is picking up the pace on Mars thanks to technology that helps the robot avoid running into trouble on its otherworldly drives. That technology called AutoNav is a navigation system that maps terrain and plans routes without the rover needing to rely as heavily on guidance from Earth. AutoNav is four or five times more powerful than equivalent technology tested on NASA's previous Mars rover Curiosity which means Perseverance will be able to take more direct routes and travel faster in turn allowing the rover to do more science in the same amount of time. "We're going to be able to get to places the scientists want to go much more quickly" Jennifer Trosper project manager for the rover at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California said in a NASA statement. "Now we are able to drive through these more complex terrains instead of going around them: It's not something we've been able to do before." A Grisly Skin Disease Is Creeping Into the American South Three years ago Laura Gaither and her family spent their summer vacation in Panama City Beach Florida. One afternoon while rinsing sand off her feet the 35-year-old Alabama resident felt something biting her legs and noticed tiny black bugs on her skin. […] Gaither started doing her own research and learned about a flesh-eating disease called cutaneous leishmaniasis (pronounced leash-ma-NYE-a-sis). This skin disease is caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania parasites. It can be transmitted to humans through the bite of some sand flies after the flies themselves have been infected by animals—usually rodents in the United States—whose blood the insects feed on. Sand flies thrive in hot sandy beaches and in rural areas and they had been particularly abundant in Florida in 2018 Gaither was told during her visit. Leishmaniasis Gaither learned is common in tropical and subtropical countries like Brazil Mexico and India. Looking through peer-reviewed papers she saw pictures of leishmaniasis wounds that looked a lot like her own: craterlike ulcers coated with a thick yellowish pus. […] Americans it turns out can be exposed to Leishmania parasites without leaving the country. The parasites are currently endemic in Texas and Oklahoma and new studies suggest that they might be present in other states including Florida. While reported cases of leishmaniasis contracted in the U.S. are currently negligible they may soon be on the rise: As climate change pushes rodent and sand-fly habitats northward scientists caution that in the future an increasing number of U.S. residents could be exposed to different varieties of the flesh-eating parasite. Why Are Gamers So Much Better Than Scientists at Catching Fraud? In the competitive pursuit of speedrunning gamers vie to complete a given video game as quickly as humanly possible. It’s a sport for the nerdier among us and it’s amazingly popular: Videos streaming and recording speedruns routinely rack up seven-figure view counts on Twitch and YouTube. So when one very prominent speedrunner—a U.S. YouTuber with more than 20 million subscribers who goes by the nom de game “Dream”—was accused in December 2020 of faking one of his world-record runs of the block-building game Minecraft the online drama exploded like a batch of TNT. Specifically Dream reported that he’d finished Minecraft in just over 19 minutes faster than all but four players had ever managed it because of an incredible stretch of good luck. Moderators at the website speedrun.com who preside over such world-record attempts begged to differ. According to their impressively detailed probability analysis Dream’s luck was just too good. He was the equivalent of a roulette player who gets their color 50 times in a row: You don’t just marvel at the good fortune; you check underneath the table. […] Two weeks before Dream’s confession and halfway around the world another fraud scandal had just come to a conclusion. Following a long investigation Japan’s Showa University released a report on one of its anesthesiology researchers Hironobu Ueshima. Ueshima had turned out to be one of the most prolific scientific frauds in history having partly or entirely fabricated records and data in at least 84 scientific papers and altered data and misrepresented authorship on dozens more. Like Dream Ueshima would eventually come clean and apologize—but only after a data sleuth had spotted strange anomalies in his publications. Many of his papers have already been expunged from the scientific literature. Scorching Heat in Siberia and Europe – Record Low Ice Coverage in Arctic Ocean’s Laptev Sea While record-breaking heat enveloped the Pacific Northwest in June 2021 other parts of the Northern Hemisphere also saw early-summer temperatures climb. […] One of the hot spots parked over central and eastern Europe. On June 23 ground stations in Moscow measured an air temperature of 34.8°C (94.6°F)—the city’s hottest June temperature on record. Helsinki Finland also saw its hottest June day on record (31.7°C/89.1°F) and national records for the month were set in Belarus (35.7°C/96.3°F) and Estonia (34.6°C/94.3°F). According to Jennifer Francis a scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center the heatwave is the result of a persistent northward bulge in the polar jet stream. “This is associated with a blocking pattern in the jet stream that has been prevalent over Scandinavia this year and contributed to unusually warm conditions there especially in Finland” Francis said. Scientists Reveal Causes of Concrete and Asphalt Deterioration Scientists reveal that the deterioration of modern concrete and asphalt structures is due to the presence of trace quantities of organic matter in these structures. Cement and asphalt are vital to modern construction materials; cement is used for the construction of various buildings and structures while asphalt is primarily used for highways and runways. They have been widely used for these purposes since the 1800s. It has been observed modern concrete structures and asphalt structures tend to deteriorate much faster than historical structures but the reason for this phenomenon was unknown. A team of scientists from six institutions including Akihiro Moriyoshi Emeritus Professor Hokkaido University have revealed that the presence of trace quantities of organic matter in modern concrete structures and asphalt pavements drive the deterioration of these structures. Their findings which include novel methods to assess deterioration were published in the journal PLOS ONE. A $26-billion plan to save the Houston area from rising seas When Hurricane Ike made landfall in 2008 Bill Merrell took shelter on the second floor of a historic brick building in downtown Galveston Texas along with his wife their daughter their grandson and two Chihuahuas. Sustained winds of 110 mph lashed the building. Seawater flooded the ground floor to a depth of over 8 feet. Once in the night Merrell caught glimpses of a near-full moon and realized they had entered the hurricane’s eye. Years earlier Merrell a physical oceanographer at Texas A&M University at Galveston had toured the gigantic Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier a nearly 6-mile-long bulwark that prevents North Sea storms from flooding the southern Dutch coast. As Ike roared outside Merrell kept thinking about the barrier. “The next morning I started sketching what I thought would look reasonable here” he said “and it turned out to be pretty close to what the Dutch would have done.” These sketches were the beginning of the Ike Dike a proposal for a coastal barrier intended to protect Galveston Bay. The core idea: combining huge gates across the main inlet into the Bay from the Gulf of Mexico known as Bolivar Roads with many miles of high seawalls.  I cover a lot of climate disasters. To an extent I’ve learned to compartmentalize.But hearing about people who collapsed in the street as they tried to walk to cooling shelters this week the little box labeled “outrage and grief” broke open for me.https://t.co/BoGa1STarz  1.

Don't try to tell me climate isn't infrastructure.  Let’s be clear: $1 billion spent on clean energy would create twice as many jobs as $1 billion spent on defense.It’s time to put the needs of the people over wasteful spending at the Pentagon.  How bad will it get?The "Atlas for A Green New Deal" paints a picture that is both alarming and hopeful.#citylabarchive https://t.co/mISV3rGtsf  Cartoon pic.twitter.com/VBBMKAQfcg  Maybe it’s time we talked about how these billionaires building their own space programs to personally escape the climate apocalypse and political crises are spending the money we have every right to and is necessary to actually address those problems.
