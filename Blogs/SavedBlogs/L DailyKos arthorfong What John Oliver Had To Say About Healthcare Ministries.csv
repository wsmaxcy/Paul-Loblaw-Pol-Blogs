L, What John Oliver Had To Say About Healthcare Ministries, arthorfong, 2021-06-28, If anyone caught last night's John Oliver on HBO the comedian dove deep into healthcare sharing ministries that some people have touted as replacements for health insurance. That they are not and Oliver leaves you in no doubt as to why. The episode is on YouTube which you can check out below: Healthcare ministries are religious organizations usually Christian where believers come together and share healthcare costs. But not just Christian they also exist in many immigrant religious communities where these places of worship act like community centers and provide vital aid for healthcare costs to their congregations. These have existed for decades but have come to prominence now since the Affordable Care Act which the Republicans deride as Obamacare included them as exemptions in the law's mandate. In fact because of the law healthcare ministries have exploded from 200000 to over a million. Because they aren't technically insurance company they are free to decline healthcare to people who pay into them based on anything--including pre-existing conditions. They can also decline healthcare for substance abuse and mental health issues. That leaves a million people exposed in the current system. Imagine being LGBTQ+ and having someone deny you much needed psychological healthcare for issues surrounding your identity. Or being declined necessary drugs for gender reassignment because it offends the morals of the church.  As amusing as John Oliver's segment was this is an issue that reflects the short-sightedness of the ACA. Some of these ministries are huge and people pay thousands into them often getting nothing in return in their time of need.  These ministries are growing. As Oliver comically showed in places like Florida almost any organization can become a healthcare ministry. People just need to share a vaguely defined set of beliefs and ethics. To demonstrate he pointed his viewers to www.freedomfromhealthcare.org which is attached to a fake church he created back in 2015 to demonstrate the unfair tax exemptions for churches - Our Lady of Perpetual Health. It's about time we had a proper free at the point of use healthcare system for everyone.
