L, How New Disasters Upend Old Successes:Climate Disruption is Undermining the Clean Air Act., DrMarmot, 2021-04-25, The Clean Air Act whose most important provisions were enacted in 1970 is one of the greatest achievements in American history a civil rights milestone whose legacy should make every American’s chest swell with pride.  The numbers are abstract but nevertheless tell a spellbinding story. In 2020 alone the Clean Air Act’s mandated reduction in fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 and smaller) and ground level ozone pollution prevented:            * 230000 adult deaths            * 280 infant deaths            * 200000 heart attacks (Acute Myocardial Infarctions)            * 180000 cases of Acute Bronchitis            * 2400000 cases of exacerbated asthma.             * And much much more. The health effects of the Clean Air Act are so profound that they have increased the average American Lifespan by 1.6 years. Health outcomes are only one positive effect of the Clean Air Act. Over its history the law has improved our lives in ways as diverse as reducing noise pollution—a concern that desperately needs to be revivified—and the clearing of viewsheds. These and the Act’s many other benefits far outstrip the costs of producing them.  The Clean Air Act also harkens back to a time when bipartisan government action could achieve great things. Legislating in the wake of the massive Earth Day protests the Senate passed the Clean Air Act 73-0; the House lost only one vote passing it 374-1. Richard Nixon signed it into law.  But the Clean Air Act is no longer working as it once did. Climate disruption is overwhelming this pillar of environmental law. The Clean Air Act that helped make industrial civilization tolerable is being overrun by the civilization-threatening changes wrought by a hotter more unstable planet.  To grasp the scale of how climate disruption threatens environmental improvement it is important to understand how such improvements are made even without the passing of new legislation. (One symptom of conservative dominance of recent American history: the USA has not passed major environmental legislation since 1980 at the tail end of the Carter administration.) Despite the conservative attack on environmental policy our air has become substantially cleaner over time. This is due to a phenomenon some political scientists have called Green Drift: the ability to use existing legislation to promulgate new regulations. Updating statutes executive branch policymaking use of the courts to enforce existing statues bureaucratic routines and public expectations have all contributed to a green administrative state in which important environmental gains can be wrought even in the absence of new legislation. This is possible because of the expansive nature of the Clean Air Act: it not only addressed a long list of specific pollutants but also “air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”  And yet climate disruption threatens even the piecemeal and incremental improvements hard won through the bureaucratic processes that constitute green drift.  This sad phenomenon is made clear by the American Lung Association’s most recent “State of the Air” report. The document acknowledges that “from the beginning the findings in ‘State of the Air’ have reflected the successes of the now-50-year-old Clean Air Act.” However “in recent years …the findings of the report have added to the evidence that a changing climate is making it harder to protect human health.” The problems are severe and widespread. The report states that in 2021 “More than four in ten Americans (41.1%–more than 135 million Americans) are living in the 217 counties across the nation with monitors that are capturing unhealthy levels ozone or particle pollution.” Though this number continues to decline—mostly due to lessened ozone pollution— “this year’s report finds an increase of close to 1.1 million people living in areas with unhealthy levels of short-term particle pollution compared to last year's report.” The difference is the negative disruptions of the climate. Paul Billings the national senior vice president for public policy at the American Lung Association explained to Sierra magazine that “the main thing that’s different is climate change. We had four years of an administration that didn’t want to enforce the Clean Air Act and compliance lagged during that time. But the big driver was the changing climate: hotter weather driving more days with conditions that are conducive to higher ozone levels and the impact of wildfire that is driven by the drought from global warming.” The American Lung Association report explains the links between climate disruption and lung health: “Climate change enhances conditions for ozone pollution to form and makes it harder clean up communities where ozone levels are high.” A warmer drier more volatile climate also “increases the risk of wildfires that spread particle pollution in the smoke.” And that particulate pollution causes a variety of health problems including early death heart attacks strokes and emergency room visits lung cancer asthma and even lower newborn birth weights. The worsening pollution of our air affects all Americans—indeed all living things—negatively but not equally. Many of the worst outcomes of poorer air quality hit racial minorities and poor people the hardest. The report notes that “people of color are over three times more likely to be breathing the most polluted air than white people.” 70 million non-white people lived in counties that earned a failing grade from the Lung Associated for ozone or particulate matter pollution. 13 American counties failed all three measures used the Lung Association to measure air quality. Those counties account for 20.7 million people or 6.3% of all Americans. Of those 20.7 million Americans most cruelly affected by polluted air 14 million are people of color. Overall “people of color were 61% more likely than white people to live in a county with a failing grade for at least one pollutant and over three times as likely to live in a county with a failing grade for all three pollutants.” The effects of air pollution are also more dire for people with existing health concerns. People suffering from asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) lung cancer cardiovascular disease and smokers are more vulnerable to dire health outcomes instigated by and exacerbated through air pollution. Because of the systematic racism in American society people of color already suffer from these diseases in greater proportion than whites. To make matters even worse people of color have poorer access to health care and thus are doubly disadvantaged in trying to remedy their health problems. Nonwhites then suffer from pollution in greater proportion than whites have more severe existing health problems that are exacerbated by air pollution and have less access to adequate health care that might help alleviate their health problems.  Climate disruption then is not only undermining our already inadequate environmental progress but is undermining our already inadequate racial progress as well. As always the climate and other environmental issues are not just about nonhuman nature but also are about human bodies and how those bodies are socially positioned. The environment is in our bones and in our society. When we sicken the natural world we sicken ourselves.  For those interested the American Lung Association has a petition calling upon the Biden Administration to “champion clean air for all.” You can sign it here.
