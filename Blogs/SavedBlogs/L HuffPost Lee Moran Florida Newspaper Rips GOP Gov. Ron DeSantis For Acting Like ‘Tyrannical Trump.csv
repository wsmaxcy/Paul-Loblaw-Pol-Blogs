L, Florida Newspaper Rips GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis For Acting Like ‘Tyrannical' Trump, Lee Moran, 2021-05-07, The editorial board of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel tore into Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday for signing a controversial bill that restricts voting rights. In a lengthy editorial the newspaper accused DeSantis — who only gave Fox News access to the signing ceremony — of acting increasingly “like his role model the tyrannical Donald Trump who picked petty fights with news outlets and cherry-picked reporters who tossed softball questions.” It was “another revealing glimpse of life under the iron-fisted rule of DeSantis in Florida a place where the doors are shut tight to anyone who might question his wisdom or challenge his authority” and the “latest sign of DeSantis’ authoritarian grip” on the state the newspaper said. “Like Trump DeSantis keeps revealing his thin skin and his willful attacks on the press are dangerous in a free society” the editorial added calling the voting law “oppressive.” “Shame on Republicans for this law which will only make it harder for lawful votes to be counted and will undermine public faith in Florida elections” it added.
