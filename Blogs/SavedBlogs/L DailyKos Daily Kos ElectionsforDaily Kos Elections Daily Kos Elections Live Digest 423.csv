Joe Manchin the most conservative Democratic in the chamber endorsed Republican incumbent Lisa Murkowski. Manchin previously crossed party lines by backing Maine Sen. Susan Collins last cycle; neither Murkowski nor Collins supported Manchin during his 2018 re-election bid. FL-Sen FL-Gov: Democratic Rep. Val Demings on Thursday reiterated her interest in running for Senate or governor adding “It's next year right and so I'd need to make that decision soon for sure by mid-year. And we're almost there now.” Demings did not indicate if she was leaning towards one statewide race over the other. MO-Sen: The Kansas City Star recently asked former NASCAR driver Carl Edwards if he was interested in seeking the Republican nomination for this open seat and he did not rule out the idea. Edwards said “I don’t have an active campaign going on” before he talked about his belief “in the founding principles and individual freedom and liberty and sustainability of our way of life.” He added “There might be a day when I’m able to help with that.” FL-20: Palm Beach County Commissioner Mack Bernard said Thursday that he would not compete in the still-unscheduled special election for this safely blue seat. KS-03: 2020 Republican nominee Amanda Adkins earned an endorsement Friday from 4th District Rep. Ron Estes for her second campaign against Democratic incumbent Sharice Davids.  OH-01: Franklin Mayor Brent Centers filed FEC paperwork Thursday for a potential campaign for the Cincinnati-area seat currently held by his fellow Republican Rep. Steve Chabot. Centers previously said he planned to enter the race in early May. New York City NY Mayor: The city Campaign Finance Board on Thursday approved former White House Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan for matching funds.  The Board said the previous week that it was “deferring its decision” as it sought “further information” about a super PAC that has received at least $3 million from the candidate's father but it cleared Donovan for public financing following its review. With this development all of the notable Democrats competing in the June primary have received matching funds except former Citigroup executive Raymond McGuire who is not taking part in the program. Meanwhile attorney Maya Wiley received an endorsement on Friday from EMILY’s List. The field also includes two other pro-choice women former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia and nonprofit executive Dianne Morales. Manhattan NY District Attorney: Former State Chief Deputy Attorney General Alvin Bragg recently picked up endorsements from two prominent labor groups ahead of the crowded June Democratic primary: the healthcare workers union 1199 SEIU and 32BJ which represents building and airport employees. CA-AG: The state legislature on Thursday overwhelmingly voted to confirm Democratic Assemblyman Rob Bonta to replace Xavier Becerra who resigned last month to become U.S. secretary of health and human services as California attorney general. Bonta who has made a name for himself as a criminal justice reformer is also the first Filipino American to hold this post.  Bonta already faces a challenge from Republican Nathan Hochman a former federal prosecutor in his 2022 campaign for a full four-year term. The bigger threat in this very blue state though could come from Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert a Republican-turned-independent who is publicly considering a bid Politico writes that Schubert who attracted plenty of attention in 2016 after the Golden State Killer was apprehended has also “hammered California’s unemployment fraud failures and has excoriated [criminal justice] reformers.” Schubert though would need to get through the top-two primary before she could focus on Bonta and it’s far from guaranteed that she’d be able to advance if Hochman or a different Republican emerges as Team Red’s frontrunner. IA-Sen IA-Gov: Democratic state Auditor Rob Sand recently told Iowa Press that he was thinking about running for the Senate governor or for re-election in 2022 and that he didn’t have a timeline to decide. Sand won this post in 2018 by unseating a Republican incumbent 51-46 even as GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds was prevailing 50-48. CA-Gov: Former reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner announced Friday that she would compete as a Republican in this year’s likely recall election against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. In addition to Jenner the GOP field includes former Rep. Doug Ose 2018 nominee John Cox and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and could still expand further. Jenner who would be the first transgender person elected statewide anywhere has not sought office before though she’s not completely new to politics. She was a vocal Donald Trump supporter in 2016 although Politico recently reported that she didn’t cast a ballot at all that year; Jenner also did not vote in 2018 when Newsom was elected governor.  Jenner insisted in 2017 that while Trump has “made some mistakes” on LGBTQ issues she didn’t regret backing him but she finally acknowledged the following year that she’d been wrong. That public break however didn’t stop Jenner from hiring multiple high-level Trump campaign personnel for her bid or accepting help from former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. NH-Gov: 2020 Democratic nominee Dan Feltes told the Concord Monitor that he had “no intention right now of putting my name on the ballot in 2022” though he didn’t rule out a second bid for governor.  Feltes who was state Senate majority leader at the time raised a credible $1.7 million last time for his bid against Republican Gov. Chris Sununu but the popular incumbent defeated him in a 65-33 landslide. Sununu has yet to announce if he’ll run for a fourth two-year term or challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan instead. ME-02: The Bangor Daily News takes a look at the potential Republican field to take on Rep. Jared Golden in this 52-45 Trump seat a northern Maine constituency that is the reddest Democratic-held congressional district in America. So far though the only notable politician who appears to have publicly expressed interest so far is state Rep. Mike Perkins who said Thursday he was forming an exploratory committee 2020 nominee Dale Crafts meanwhile said he wasn’t ruling out a second try. Crafts who is a former state representative was decisively outraised by Golden last time and major outside groups on both sides dramatically cut their ad buys in the final weeks of the race in what Politico characterized at the time as "a sign of no confidence" in the Republican. Golden ended up prevailing 53-47 which was far closer than what almost any publicly released poll showed. State Sen. Lisa Keim and former state Rep. Alex Willette said they wouldn’t run but the Bangor Daily News writes that former Rep. Bruce Poliquin who lost this seat to Golden in 2018 did not respond to questions about his plans. Poliquin spent much of 2019 talking about seeking a rematch against Golden but he ultimately announced that while he was "itching to run again" he had to skip that race to care for his elderly parents While Democrats control the governorship and both houses of the legislature redistricting isn't likely to alter Maine's congressional boundaries all that much. The state requires two-thirds of each chamber to pass a new map and there are more than enough Republicans to block any districts they view as unfavorable. If the legislature deadlocks the state Supreme Court would take charge of redistricting. NV-04: 2020 candidate Sam Peters has announced that he’ll once again compete for the Republican nomination to take on Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford. Peters who is an Air Force veteran and businessman lost last year’s primary 35-28 to former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Horsford went on to beat Marchant 51-46 as Joe Biden was carrying this northern Las Vegas area seat by a similar 51-47 spread.  TX-06: The progressive firm Data for Progress has released a survey of May 1 all-party primary that shows Republican party activist Susan Wright the wife of the late Rep. Ron Wright in first with 22%.  2018 Democratic nominee Jana Lynne Sanchez leads Republican state Rep. Jake Ellzey by a small 16-13 margin in the contest for the second spot in an all-but-assured runoff with a few other candidates from each party also in striking distance. Former Trump administration official Brian Harrison and Democrat Shawn Lassiter who works as an education advocate are at 10% while 2020 Democratic state House nominee Lydia Bean is at 9%.  The only other poll we’ve seen all month was a Meeting Street Research survey for the conservative blog Free Beacon from mid-April that showed a very tight four-way race. Those numbers had Sanchez and Wright at 16% and 15% respectively with Ellzey at 14% and Harrison taking 12%. Data for Progress also polled a hypothetical runoff between Wright and Sanchez and found the Republican up 53-43. This seat which includes part of Arlington and rural areas south of Dallas supported Trump only 51-48 in 2020 after backing him 54-42 four years before but Republicans have done better downballot. TX-15: 2020 GOP nominee Monica De La Cruz-Hernandez’s second campaign picked up an endorsement Friday from Sen. Ted Cruz. De La Cruz-Hernandez who held Democratic incumbent Vicente Gonzalez to a shockingly close 51-48 win last year is the only notable Republican currently in the race for this Rio Grande Valley seat which backed Joe Biden only 50-49 after supporting Hillary Clinton by a wide 57-40. WA-04: Far-right ex-cop Loren Culp announced Thursday that he would challenge Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse who is one of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump in January. Culp who was the GOP’s 2020 nominee for governor made it very clear he’d be making his campaign all about that vote: After accusing the incumbent of having a “spine made of jelly” Culp without offering any evidence accused Newhouse of making “some kind of deal” with Democrats. Newhouse was already facing intra-party challenges on his right from state Rep. Brad Klippert and businessman Jerrod Sessler in next year’s top-two primary and more could still join. It’s possible that a crowded field of opponents could split the anti-Newhouse GOP vote in the 4th District and allow the congressman to advance to a general election with a Democrat but that’s far from assured. This 58-40 Trump seat is red enough that Newhouse went up against a fellow Republican in both 2014 and 2016 and this eastern Washington seat will almost certainly remain very conservative turf after redistricting. Culp may also be prominent enough to emerge as Newhouse’s main foe especially since Klippert did not report raising any money in the time between his January launch and the end of March. (Sessler entered the race in early April.) Culp himself served as the small community of Republic which is located in the neighboring 5th District in 2018 when he made news by announcing he wouldn't enforce a statewide gun safety ballot measure that had just passed 59-41.  Culp's stance drew a very favorable response from far-right rocker Ted Nugent who posted a typo-ridden "Chief Loren Culp is an Anerican freedom warrior. Godbless the freedom warriors" message to his Facebook page. Culp soon decided to challenge Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and he quickly made it clear he would continue to obsessively cultivate the Trump base rather than appeal to a broader group of voters in this blue state. That tactic helped Culp advance through the top-two primary an occasion he celebrated by reaffirming his opposition to Inslee's measures to stop the pandemic including mask mandates. Inslee ended up winning by a wide 57-43 but Culp responded by saying he’d “never concede.” Instead he filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Kim Wyman a fellow Republican that made allegations of “intolerable voting anomalies” for a contest “that was at all times fraudulent.”  The state GOP did not welcome Culp’s refusal to leave the stage though. Some Republicans also openly shared their complaints about Culp’s campaign spending including what the Seattle Times’ Jim Brunner described as “large unexplained payments to a Marysville data firm while spending a relatively meager sum on traditional voter contact.”  Culp also gave himself a total of $48000 for lost wages and mileage reimbursement a sum that Brunner said “appears to be the largest-ever for a candidate in Washington state.” Republicans also griped that Culp had spent only about a fifth of his $3.3 million budget on advertising a far smaller amount than what serious candidates normally expend. Culp’s attorney ultimately withdrew the suit after being threatened with sanction for making “factually baseless” claims. Culp himself responded to the news by saying that while the cost of continuing the legal battle would have been prohibitive “It doesn’t mean that the war’s over … It just means that we’re not going to engage in this particular battle through the courts.”  Newhouse for his part responded to Culp’s new campaign by reaffirming that he’ll be running for a fifth term next year. Newhouse brought in $288000 during the first quarter for his campaign and he ended March with $528000 to defend himself.
