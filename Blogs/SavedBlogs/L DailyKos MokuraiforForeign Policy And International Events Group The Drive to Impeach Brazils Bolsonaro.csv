L, The Drive to Impeach Brazil's Bolsonaro, MokuraiforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-07-05, If you have paid any attention at all you know that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is as Trumpish as they come claiming to be outside politics then trying to impose authoritarianism and totally botching Brazil’s anti-covid response. But he doesn’t have a sound experienced opposition. Instead Guilhereme Boulos is trying to make it up as he goes along having run as a Socialist and now allying with a far-right party. This is more like Israeli politics than the US. Well you have to start somewhere. The Brazilian protest leader determined to bring Bolsonaro’s ‘genocidal’ government down - video The Guardian follows Guilherme Boulos who ran against Bolsonaro in the last elections as he leads thousands through the streets of São Paulo calling for the country’s president to be impeached. The pressure is mounting on Bolsonaro as he faces a scandal over allegedly corrupt Covid vaccine deals and public rage over his handling of a pandemic that has killed more than half a million people. Boulos has helped lead and organise two mass demonstrations already in the past month and will be at the forefront of a third protest this Saturday. Tens of thousands of people are expected to turn out.or Click through for the video of Boulos which DK will not accept for embedding. Or view it here. Both are in Portuguese captioned in English.

Guilherme Boulos Two years into Jair Bolsonaro’s controversial presidency Brazil’s fragmented left has mostly struggled to unify behind a leader to challenge the far right. Guilherme Boulos has begun to change that bolstered by a November run for mayor of São Paulo. Born and raised in the city—the largest in South America—Boulos has worked for two decades as a community organizer in poor neighborhoods. A month before the first round of voting he was polling in fourth place as a minority-party candidate with just 10% of the expected vote. But by winning over young people and energizing voters disillusioned with the mainstream left Workers’ Party Boulos beat out Bolsonaro’s preferred candidate and others to make it to the second round. In the end he lost the election—winning 40.6% of the vote to the center-right incumbent’s 59.4%—but analysts said his shock performance in the influential city established him as an ascendant figure in Brazilian politics and gave the left a new path forward. Many expect Boulos to run for President in 2022 and to play a major role in rebuilding the left’s strength in the meantime. “This isn’t something that ended [with the election]” Boulos told a Brazilian newspaper after his loss. “Our campaign is the start of a new cycle.” Pressure mounts on Bolsonaro amid rising anger over vaccine corruption scandal  Tens of thousands to demand Bolsonaro’s removal from office after incendiary reports on allegedly corrupt deals to acquire vaccines. Jair Bolsonaro has been plunged into arguably the most treacherous moment of his presidency as the Brazilian leader faces a snowballing scandal over allegedly corrupt Covid vaccine deals and mounting public rage over his handling of an epidemic that has killed more than half a million people. Tens of thousands of protesters are expected to return to the streets on Saturday to demand Bolsonaro’s removal from office – the third such mass demonstration in just over a month. On Wednesday a curious coalition of left- and rightwing opponents submitted a fresh petition for Bolsonaro’s impeachment after the Brazilian media published incendiary claims about supposedly dodgy dealings to acquire coronavirus vaccines. “Now is the time to bring down Bolsonaro” said Guilherme Boulos a prominent leftist who signed the impeachment request and is among the organizers of this weekend’s rallies which unusually some rightwingers have said they will join. The plot thickened on Tuesday when the Folha de São Paulo newspaper reported claims that a health ministry logistics chief had sought a multimillion-dollar bribe for the procurement of 400m AstraZeneca vaccines from a company called Davati Medical Supply. The official who reportedly demanded $1 per dose was subsequently fired. Bolsonaro had survived previous crises thanks to his loyal support base and the backing of the “centrão” a powerful bloc of self-serving ideology-lite centre-right parties. But given the profoundly traumatic impact Covid has had on South America’s largest country it is unclear he will manage to dodge blame this time. “This is the most significant moment of political erosion Bolsonaro has faced” Boghossian said. Many observers doubt however that Brazil’s Vaccine-gate will cause Bolsonaro’s administration to crumble immediately. The influential president of Brazil’s lower house Arthur Lira would need to approve any impeachment process and has repeatedly indicated he will not. Polls show support for Bolsonaro is collapsing but remains considerable. Well Everything is impossible until it isn’t. Nelson Mandela who faced a much higher level of impossibility than this when serving a life sentence for terrorism. Former President Lula da Silva could have whomped Bolsonaro in a free and fair election (ha) but was not allowed to run in 2018 due to an entirely improper and illegal conviction for corruption that Brazil’s Supreme Court eventually threw out. What will happen next time is entirely up in the air between Bolsonaro and his operatives some corrupt judges and some honest ones and with the lingering hit to Lula’s reputation from his bogus criminal conviction. Socialists don’t think much of Boulos as a Leftist these days. Brazilian pseudo-left leader Guilherme Boulos seeks political accommodation with far right On April 18 Guilherme Boulos the foremost figure within the Brazilian pseudo-left held a private political meeting with the president of the Republicanos party Marcos Pereira a federal House deputy. The Republicanos’ leadership includes two sons of Brazil’s fascistic President Jair Bolsonaro who are elected officials—Senator Flávio and Rio de Janeiro Councilor Carlos—and serves as a political front for the businesses of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (IURD). The IURD is a neo-charismatic church which is based in Brazil but has international branches and is firmly aligned with Donald Trump’s faction of the US Republican Party. A raging pandemic is adding 3000 victims a day to a total of almost 400000 dead. This has been combined with a skyrocketing of social inequality with 60 percent of Brazilians facing food insecurity and over 20 million thrown into poverty even as the billionaires have increased their wealth by 72 percent over the past year of mass death. Oy. So who can you work with in Brazil? Remember that in the U.S. FDR Liberals used to have to ally with the Southern segregationist Democrats until Truman desegregated the military starting in 1948 and the Southerners began to bolt to the Republicans whose children began to fall away by the millions. It has taken more than sixty years to sort that mess out so that the U.S. has a clearly Progressive super-majority party and a clearly fascistic conspiracy-driven minority one and the fight between them is nowhere near over. When Boulos was running for Mayor of São Paulo as a straight-up Socialist it was different. Then it was just the Homeless Workers' Movement/Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto MTST “Our Task Is to Defeat Bolsonarism and Put an End to His Authoritarian Project” Translated interview with Guilherme Boulos. Through direct confrontation and negotiation with the government the MTST struggles to reduce Brazil's housing deficit by staging squatters' occupations in abandoned government buildings in Brazilian cities. According to the MTST there are over 5 million housing units available in abandoned buildings in Brazil. As ever if you aren’t confused you aren’t paying attention.
