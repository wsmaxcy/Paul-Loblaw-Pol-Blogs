L, Sheriff Blasts Cyber Ninjas After They Demand Access To Government Passwords, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-10, Cyber Ninjas the private company conducting the GOP 2020 election "recount" in Arizona now wants access to government internet routers and passwords. The Maricopa County sheriff blasted the demand as ‚Äúmind-numbingly reckless and irresponsible‚Äù and a threat to law enforcement. Via Huffington Post: Sheriff Paul Penzone (D) said in a statement that providing router information to a shadowy private company led by a conspiracy-embracing CEO would compromise sensitive and highly classified law enforcement data and equipment. ‚ÄúThe Senate Republican Caucus‚Äô audit of the Maricopa County votes from last November‚Äôs election has no stopping point‚Äù Penzone said. ‚ÄúNow its most recent demands jeopardize the entire mission of the Maricopa County Sheriff‚Äôs Office.‚Äù  [...] In response to Senate subpoenas last week county attorney Allister Adel explained in a letter that turning over the requested routers or ‚Äúvirtual images‚Äù of routers not only poses a significant security risk to the sheriff‚Äôs office it also ‚Äúputs sensitive confidential data belonging to Maricopa County‚Äôs citizens ‚Äî including Social Security numbers and protected health information ‚Äî at risk as well‚Äù reported the Arizona Republic.
