L, GOP Rep. Paul Gosar Ripped By His Own Sister: ‘Despicable And Disgusting’, Ed Mazza, 2021-07-05, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) who has espoused conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 insurrection and defended those who attacked the U.S. Capitol as “peaceful patriots” is being called out publicly by his own sister.  “He uses it ... to fundraise and I find that even more despicable and disgusting” Jennifer Gosar said on CNN over the weekend. She said her brother should be held “criminally accountable” if reports of his involvement with the organizers of the insurrection are true.  CNN’s Pamela Brown asked Jennifer Gosar what she would say to her bother.  “I wouldn’t communicate with him” she said. “I don’t align myself with the Oath Keepers the Proud Boys or any other hate group” she added referring to some of the extremist groups involved in the Jan. 6 attack. Paul Gosar has also repeatedly been linked to white nationalists.  “Why would I ally with him just because we share DNA?” she said.  She said she has tried to reach him in the past but “nothing’s worked.” Now she just wants him held accountable.  Six of the congressman’s siblings including Jennifer Gosar endorsed his opponent in 2018. Several of them also appeared in an ad earlier this year calling for him to be held accountable over the insurrection.  See Jennifer Gosar’s latest interview below.
