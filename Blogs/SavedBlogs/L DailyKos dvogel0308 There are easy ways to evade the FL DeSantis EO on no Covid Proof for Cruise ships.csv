L, There are easy ways to evade the FL DeSantis EO on no Covid Proof for Cruise ships, dvogel0308, 2021-07-07, First of all you could just start the cruise from another place outside FL but assuming you still wanted to leave out of FL here are some ideas that DeSantis cannot touch... 1. His EO will only extend to the state of FL they can decide to sell tickets from anywhere else in the world to whoever they want and with whatever restrictions they want including requiring proof of vaccination.  They cannot check proof of vaccination during embarkation process in FL however. 2. They could charge a $50 per day Covid Cleaning fee for all passengers and waive that fee for anyone fully vaccinated.  Nothing that DeSantis could do about that. 3. They could put onerous restrictions on unvaccinated passengers like submitting to a daily COVID test at sea (again not in FL waters) segregated dining and access to pubic areas.  They could restrict land excursions to those who are fully vaccinated (as long as they are not doing a land excursion in FL) 4. They could require any unvaccinated persons to buy trip insurance and interruption insurance in case they get sick and need to be medivacced off the ship at their discretion. I am sure if I had more time I could be more creative...peace
