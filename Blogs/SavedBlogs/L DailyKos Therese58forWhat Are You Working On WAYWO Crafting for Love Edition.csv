L, WAYWO: Crafting for Love Edition, Therese58forWhat Are You Working On?, 2021-04-18, I’ve been sewing all my life. I started learning hand sewing at the age of 5 from a very dear Benedictine nun who was my kindergarten teacher. I remember sewing uneven running stitches on a piece of cloth using the stripes as guides. A few years later I attended the summer sewing classes held by Singer and made a simple dress in blue-on-white dotted Swiss fabric with little ruffles at the shoulders. From there I went on to sew more elaborate items - dresses pants blouses stuffed animals quilts etc. etc. My mom wasn’t a sewer – she abandoned sewing in high school home ec when she made an accidental beyond-repair cut in an almost-finished blouse. She did go on to be an accomplished knitter who made clothes and blankets for us as well as hundreds of baby hats for preemies which were donated to hospitals. Mom was always supportive of my craft endeavors even when they were kind of messy. She’s passed on to me the love of crafting for others which I have been doing for many years. While my kids were growing up I sewed homemade Halloween costumes (e.g. my daughter’s pink “whoopie cushion” and disco dancer outfits of which sadly no photos survive). When they stopped asking for these I fell out of the sewing habit. We don’t have a space to dedicate to crafts and it was a hassle setting up the sewing machine on the dining room table. However since my grandson was born 3 years ago my interest has picked up and I’ve had fun again sewing for him and the rest of the family.  I’m proudest of the christening suit I sewed for him from silk dupioni as it was a more complicated project than I’d done in years. There was some spitting and swearing involved as I worked my way through the instructions but everyone thought the results looked lovely.   There’s also an Elmo suit I made for his first birthday – he looked adorable - too bad the fleece fabric turned out to be a little too warm for a bright June day!  Last summer I sewed two pairs of shorts from cool fabrics (elephants and safety pins) that he enjoyed wearing. Now I have a 11-week-old granddaughter and I anticipate more sewing goodness. Just wish I had more time! (If I get to retire in a few years…ah. Bring on the new projects.) Before the baby arrived I sewed two flannel receiving blankets which her mom has been putting to good use.   I just bought pink seersucker fabric which will be made up into a summer dress for her. Of course I’m also planning her christening gown which will be of silk taffeta. It looks like the pattern is less complicated than the suit for her brother (thank goodness no tricky snap bands for the legs just a full skirt). I’ve chosen the fabric and will order it soon. I hope it will be beautiful.  Who else enjoys crafting for family and friends? What delightful items have you made?
