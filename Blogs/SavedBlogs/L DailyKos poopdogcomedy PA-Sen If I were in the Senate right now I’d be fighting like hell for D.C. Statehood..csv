L, PA-Sen: "If I were in the Senate right now I’d be fighting like hell for D.C. Statehood.", poopdogcomedy, 2021-05-03, Received this e-mail today from Lt. Governor John Fetterman’s (D. PA) U.S. Senate campaign: My friends where in the world can you find five Wawa locations zero Sheetz locations (?) and more than half a MILLION taxpayers without voting representation in Congress? Washington D.C. The fact is that it is home to nearly 700000 people including a majority of Black and Brown residents who have built families lives and livelihoods in the District. Yet the people of D.C. have been *deeply* disenfranchised by their lack of representation in Congress throughout history. The GOP loves to cry wolf on D.C. statehood but we all know they’re terrified of what will happen when the oppressed are finally heard. So I’m telling you right here right now: It is far past time to stop this racist policy of “taxation without representation” and give the people of D.C. the political representation they deserve by making Washington D.C. the 51st state. If you’re with me will you sign my Official D.C. Statehood petition now?  The good news is that there’s a loooot of momentum growing behind D.C. Statehood. It’s been growing for years and it’s coming to a head now. The U.S. House of Representatives just passed legislation to make Washington D.C. the 51st state which is great news. Now it’s up to the Senate to take up this bill and work to get it passed. The Senate GOP may very well try and block it. If they do Senate Democrats should abolish the filibuster to get it done. If I were in the Senate right now you can bet that I’d be fighting like hell for D.C. Statehood. On a landmass that *literally* has more residents than bonafide states like Wyoming and Vermont absolutely no voter should be taken for granted. Please sign my Official D.C. Statehood petition now and let’s show just how powerful support is for representation for ALL Americans. No taxation without representation my friends.
