L, Arizona Legislative Districts 11 and 21, gboros, 2021-07-06,  Today I am going to look at two of Arizona’s legislative districts: LD 21 which is located in northwestern Maricopa County (Phoenix suburbs) and LD 11 which is located in the southeastern part of the state and covers portions of Pima County (home to Tucson) and Pinal County. (Note: I am using the broad term “legislative” district as opposed to “house” or “senate” district because Arizona’s State House and State Senate districts cover the same geographic regions with 2 house representatives and 1 senator representing each area.)  Both LD 11 and LD 21 moved a few points to the left at the presidential level between 2012 and 2016. Specifically LD 11 went from supporting Mitt Romney by about 19 points to supporting Donald Trump by around 14 points while LD 21 experienced a smaller swing to the left with Romney carrying the district by around 17 points (making the district not as red as LD 11 to begin with) and Trump carrying it by around 15 points four years later. In the 2018 midterms the Democrats made considerable progress in LD 21 with Democrat Kyrsten Sinema losing the district by around just 4 points in the U.S. Senate Race (outperforming Hillary Clinton in the district by over 10 points) while winning statewide by a little more than 2 points. By contrast in LD 11 Sinema’s improvements were considerably smaller as she lost the district by a fairly significant 10 points margin. There are potentially a few reasons why Sinema did considerably better in LD 21 than in LD 11. It should be noted that at the time of the 2018 U.S. Senate Race Sinema was the sitting representative for Arizona’s 9th Congressional District (CD) which is located in the Phoenix area while her Republican opponent Martha McSally was the sitting representative for Arizona’s 2nd CD which is located in the Tucson area. Perhaps Sinema had a geographic advantage in LD 21 while McSally had a geographic advantage (therefore a disadvantage for Sinema) in LD 11. Throughout the 2018 midterms we have also seen several instances of “mean reversion” where Democrats have underperformed (relatively) in historically Republican leaning areas so maybe Sinema was able to perform better in LD 21 than in LD 11 simply because the former district wasn’t as red to begin with.  Joe Biden on the other hand did slightly better in LD 11 than in LD 21 as he lost the former district by just under 8 points and the latter district by about 9 points. Note that Biden actually outperformed Sinema by a few points in LD 11 despite underperforming her statewide. (He won AZ by less than half a percentage point.) By contrast in LD 21 he underperformed her by over 4 points (which is more than he underperformed her by statewide). Given that Biden’s largest gains over Clinton tend to come from places that are trending blue the fastest (i.e. those where Clinton outperformed Obama the most) it makes some sense that Biden did better in LD 11 (than in LD 21) given that LD 11 swung more to the left (from 2012 to 2016). Interestingly Biden's improvements relative to Clinton were roughly the same in both districts (he outran her in both districts by around 6 points) so it doesn’t seem as though his performance in LD 21 was all that weak but rather that Sinema’s performance in the district was particularly strong.  Next it might be interesting to look at Dem Mark Kelly’s performance in these two districts in the 2020 U.S. AZ Senate Race. Kelly lost LD 21 by around 5.5 points performing in-between Biden and Sinema (but much closer to Sinema) and lost LD 11 by around 6.5 points outperforming both Biden and Sinema. Note that Kelly outperformed Biden statewide (he won by little more than 2 points roughly the same margin as Sinema) so it’s not too surprising that he outran Biden in both of the districts. However it should be noted that Kelly’s over-performance relative to Biden was greater in LD 21 than it was in LD 11. (Kelly’s stronger district was LD 21 while Biden’s stronger district was LD 11). Historically Republican-leaning areas that are trending blue at the top of the ticket still tend to be a bit redder down-ballot (due to ancestral Republican strength) so again maybe it was easier for Kelly to outperform Biden by more in LD 21 given that the district wasn’t as red to begin with. With regards to Sinema it should be pointed out that Kelly had the same Republican opponent as she did (McSally). However unlike Sinema Kelly is based in the Tucson area so neither he nor McSally should have had a geographical advantage over each other in either district. Therefore the fact that Kelly underperformed Sinema in LD 21 but outperformed her in LD 11 also doesn’t seem too surprising.   Finally the various demographics of LD 11 and LD 21 are also worth discussing. Interestingly according to recent Census estimates the two districts have extremely similar ethnic/racial breakdowns with Hispanics making up just under 27% of both districts’ total populations and Non-Hispanic Whites making up around 63% (of both districts’ total populations). However LD 11 has a higher percentage of college-educated individuals (bachelor’s degree or higher) than LD 21 (33.4% vs 22.7%) as well as a higher mean income. (The mean incomes for LD 21 and LD 11 are $71K and $85K respectively.) Given that LD 11 is a better educated and more affluent district it makes sense that the district has moved more to the left at the presidential level (than LD 21) in the past two cycles but not necessarily down-ballot given that Trump’s unpopularity may not translate to other Republicans and that affluent voters may still be concerned with traditional issues such as taxes.  Thanks to Daily Kos Elections (for the 2012 2016 and 2018 calculations as well as the 2020 Pres calculations.) I computed the 2020 U.S. Senate calculations myself.
