L, Tucker Carlson Doubles Down On White Supremacist Rant After Calls For His Firing, Josephine Harvey, 2021-04-13, Fox News host Tucker Carlson doubled down on his defense of a white nationalist conspiracy theory Monday after outrage over his comments last week. The Anti-Defamation League called on Fox News to fire Carlson Friday after he invoked on-air the “great replacement” theory a racist far-right doctrine that imagines white people are intentionally being replaced with immigrants and minorities. Carlson seemingly emboldened by his network’s decision to stand behind him replayed his original comments Monday night. “It was true and therefore worth saying” he said. “America badly needs a national conversation about it.” He then took his comments a step further insisting that “Demographic change is the key to the Democratic party’s political ambitions” and that “Democrats plan to change the population of the country” in order to win elections.

Carlson routinely flirts with overt white supremacist and anti-immigrant rhetoric on his show one of America’s most-watched programs.
