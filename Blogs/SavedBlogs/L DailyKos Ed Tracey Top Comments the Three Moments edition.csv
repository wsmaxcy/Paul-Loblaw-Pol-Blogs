In this space I seldom write about direct politics …. others with more knowledge time and organizational experience do it much better. Yet as we reach the 100-day mark of the Biden/Harris administration I’m ready to reflect on three moments from FormerGuy that have a particular hold on me. The first two are not his most outrageous statements nor the most consequential … and the third was made in private (and not revealed until much later). Rather they exemplify the willingness of others to either fawn over (or exploit) him. As such most reading this will come up with different examples than me. Cool beans and feel free to list your own in the comments. Most of his most horrific appearances were him doing things he already said he would do or were unsurprising. Here are just one schmuck’s thoughts.  One — the televised Cabinet meeting introductions  This goes back to June 12th 2017 — five months after Inauguration — when FormerGuy convened his first full Cabinet meeting in public before the cameras and microphones. Yet all that took place in public (before the cameras and microphones were shooed out-of-the-room) were his opening remarks and statements from his minions. FormerGuy spoke of how no president had accomplished more than him in such a short time …. although he did allow that perhaps FDR (during the Depression) might have. The GOP congress had not enacted anything of substance of course. Yet this was routine par-for-the-course banter from him. It was what followed that made me cringe …. the Cabinet/other key post members could simply have done what they were asked: to state their name and position and (perhaps) goals. Or they could have said what an honor it was to serve the nation the American people the citizenry etc. Instead they added fawning tributes .. that can best be summed up as: Three stand out (though not nearly  the most fawning examples): (Jeff Sessions) — “Mr. President it’s great to be here and celebrate this group ……….... and it’s an honor to be able to serve you”. Of course three months earlier he had recused himself (due to lying to Congress)  from any investigation of the 2016 campaign leading to Bob Mueller (and the Wrath of Don). The day after this Cabinet meeting he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee: earning further wrath and the Jeffster was forced-out after the 2018 midterm elections. (Reince Priebus) — “Mr. President we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.”  The Chief-of-Staff was blessed to last in that post …. another six weeks and in his “resignation” letter picked-up where he had left off: "It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this President and our country. I want to thank the President for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the President's agenda and policies”.  There was however one lone hold-out on high-praising Dear Leader: (Jim Mattis) — “Mr. President it’s an honor to represent the men and women of the Department of Defense. We are grateful for the sacrifices our people are making in order to strengthen our military so our diplomats always negotiate from a position of strength. Thank you”. (Admittedly having the troops to cite made it a bit easier to stop at “thank you”). If you are still unfamiliar with all of this ….. here is the evidence.  Two — the promised revival of coal jobs  Part of the construct of “economic anxiety” label was that Trump Digs Coal and “We are going to put the miners back to work.” To be sure that promise was not the only reason residents of coal country voted for him — one former miner was described as saying “It was Trump’s personality and background that made (him) believe he was presidential material” — yet it surely played some sort of role. That this revival did not happen — indeed the decline has continued unabated — needs little more mention here. What irked me about this (in particular) was the catering to one man: the coal magnate Bob Murray. He was given a chance to present a wish list for the end of as much industry regulation as possible to accompany the generic corporate tax cuts he would also be receiving. How Don Blankenship was sentenced to a year in jail (while Murray was not charged for a Utah mine collapse he tried to blame on an earthquake) … baffles me. Alas I cannot locate a video of this ….. yet I do recall seeing on TV a joint public appearance with Murray and then-President Trump where he was boasting about all the jobs that were going to be coming back ... when Murray felt compelled to add “Well I don’t know about that”. All I was able to find was Murray admitting (on Fox Business) that it was not possible to do it (not even FormerGuy). Sure enough: in October 2019 Murray Energy filed for bankruptcy — and the following year Bob Murray filed for black lung benefits (after fighting safety regulations aimed at reducing that very debilitating disease) — before his death last October at the age of eighty. The reason why I cite this … is because it taps into a more general gripe of mine: that in order to create more jobs a right-wing grab bag must be implemented. Tax cuts eliminate safety regulations institute tariffs jawboning (and if you can add deep social spending cuts as well even better). Companies want to hire we’re told ... but due to bone-crushing taxation and "economic uncertainty” ... they can’t. Again I cannot locate this …. but there is a quote from a CEO which (I believe) was the former head of Alcoa the late Paul O’Neill who — as George W’s first Treasury Secretary — became a thorn in his side. (Also unlike Murray he made worker safety a priority in his corporate life).          It went (something) like this: Companies only add new hires when the existing workforce can no longer provide the goods and/or services to meet demand. If a company’s demand is (relatively) stable a tax cut will boost profits … so why incur additional payroll? I recall more than one US Senator complaining about corporate welfare saying that if you went down that road: it had to be tied to employment with clawbacks essential. Otherwise stock buybacks financing an offshoring program and executive compensation is more attractive. Here’s hoping that Wisconsin governor Tony Evers was able to win enough Foxconn clawbacks. I have little expectations this reality will sink-in ….. but I can dream can’t I?  Three — the recorded Woodward interview on Covid-19  When reports of the incoming pandemic started to resonate in early 2020 I was certain that FormerGuy didn’t have the intellectual capacity to understand this. I also suspected he already latched-on to a snake-oil sales pitch (such as hydroxychloroquine) or an item he had a financial stake in. (Or all of the above).   And then …. this audiotape with Bob Woodward.  I have nothing to add to that …. except this. Had FormerGuy handled Covid in even a mediocre way (rejecting lockdowns yet asking people to wear masks and socially distance) and had a simple medium-size Infrastructure Plan passed … mercifully I don’t have to ponder what mighta been. Let’s close with this aptly-named 1970 instrumental by Traffic — and feel free to add any remarks from last night’s address or the first 100 Days.   Now on to Top Comments:  From  eyesoars: From trespekes: From  FishOutofWater: Highlighted by artofhelp: And from Ed Tracey your faithful correspondent this evening ........
