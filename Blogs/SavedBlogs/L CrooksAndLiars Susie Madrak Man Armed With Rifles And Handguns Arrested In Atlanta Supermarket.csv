L, Man Armed With Rifles And Handguns Arrested In Atlanta Supermarket, Susie Madrak, 03-25-21, Via the Washington Post: Charles Russell was shopping for an Instacart order inside a Publix supermarket in Atlanta on Wednesday afternoon when he saw a man with a rifle walking into a bathroom. “I saw an AR-15” Russell told WSB-TV referring to a similar style of semiautomatic weapon that a gunman used to kill 10 in a Boulder Colo. supermarket on Monday. “This kind of startled me just again with events that recently happened in the grocery store up in Colorado.” Russell told a store manager about the gun and an employee phoned police who arrested Rico Marley 22 after he exited the bathroom the Atlanta Police Department said in a news release on Wednesday. Officers found at least five firearms in Marley’s possession including two long guns and three pistols police said. They also found body armor ammunition and a knife according to a police photo of the weapons WSB-TV reported. This is a picture I obtained of the 6 guns and ammo found on the 22 year old suspect at the Atlantic Station Publix today. Police have said he was found with 5 but there appears to be one more handgun. Intentions of the suspect are still unknown.  https://t.co/gMZBvbwWT8 pic.twitter.com/kQG9VgSfOx — Matt Johnson (@MattWSB) March 25 2021 A local reporter who looked into Marley’s background said he has a criminal record out of DeKalb County from three years ago for a simple assault charge that was dismissed on a technicality. Marley had a weapons carry license on him Wednesday. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
