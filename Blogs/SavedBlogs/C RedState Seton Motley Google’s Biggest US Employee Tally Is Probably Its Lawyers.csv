C, Google’s Biggest US Employee Tally Is Probably Its Lawyers, Seton Motley, 2020-12-01, One of the VERY many downsides of Big Tech taking over this country?  The very few employees they hire. Obviously retail overlord Amazon is an exception.  They have to hire some US employees to delver all the Communist Chinese products they sell. But in conjunction with government officials their Big Tech cronyism and their China Virus lockdowns – Amazon is well on the way to murdering every US retailer except them. But most Big Tech companies – like Google Facebook and Twitter – are mostly a bunch of computer servers.  With a few hyper-compensated hyper-Leftist partisan executives.  And some computer programmers to keep the servers up and running – and getting ever better at consuming our minds and existences. And Big Tech doesn’t even want to hire US citizens for those few programming gigs.  So they instead hire lawyers to get even more Big Government cronyism out of the government officials they own. Tech Giants Led by Amazon Facebook and Google Spent Nearly Half a Billion on Lobbying Over the Past Decade: “Tech giants now spend as much or more as big banks pharmaceutical manufacturers and oil giants the records show led by Amazon Facebook and Google…. “Google for example dedicated roughly $150 million to lobbying over the past decade far more than any of its peers over that period….” Lawyer lobbyists do charge exorbitant hourly rates.  But $15 million per annum still hires Google a LOT of lawyer lobbyists. And for what are Big Tech lawyer lobbyists lobbying?  Even at the height of US citizen unemployment because of the Big Tech-enriching government lockdowns? Not hiring US citizens. Google Amazon Other Big Tech Companies Speak Out Against Trump Work Visa Restrictions: “Nearly 2 of 3 approved H-1B applications in 2019 were for ‘computer-related occupations.’” Big Tech Companies Band Together To Fight Trump’s Immigration Freeze When Big Tech’s lawyers aren’t lobbying to not hire Americans – they’re suing to not hire Americans. Big Tech Joins Chamber of Commerce Lawsuit to Import Foreign Workers While 26M Americans Jobless Big Tech is also awful about Intellectual Property (IP) and its protection – unless it’s theirs being stolen of course. Intellectual Property: Everyone Loves Getting Paid for It – Everyone Hates Paying for It Contained therein is a litany of lawsuits filed by Big Tech companies in defense of their IP.  And another litany of lawsuits filed against Big Tech companies for stealing other peoples’ IP. Lots and lots of Big Tech lawyers hired.  To defend Big Tech’s mass heists from actually productive people. When Google defends its IP – they’re very serious.  And incredibly hypocritical. Ex-Google Exec Sent to Prison for Stealing Robocar Secrets: “A former Google engineer has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to…one count (of)…stealing trade secrets.” Meanwhile: Almost inarguably no company anywhere on Planet Earth is a bigger IP thief than Google. Google’s Business Model – Is Theft Google’s IP Theft Entrenches Its Monopoly Power The Evidence Google’s Systematic Theft is Anti-Competitive No entity on Planet Earth rivals their IP theft – save the Communist Chinese government.  With whom Google is quite happy to work. Google’s Thieving Collaborations with Communist China and Apple – Don’t Speak Well for Google All of which is lots and LOTS of Google lawyers hired.  All to defend Google’s mass heists from actually productive people. Of course Big Tech is happy to assist Google steal IP.  Especially when the theft victim is a comparatively small tech company – which insists on standing up to Google’s ongoing rolling massive IP heists. Thieving Big Tech Teams Up Against Routine Big Tech Outlier Oracle Because a tech company defending IP – is an awful outlier look for thieving Big Tech. And a tech company successfully defending IP – puts a damper on future heists by thieving Big Tech. Google: ‘If You Don’t Let Us Steal – People Will Stop Making Things for Us to Steal’ IP-thieving Big Tech hires a big bunch of lawyers – to back the play of IP-thieving Google’s even bigger bunch of lawyers.  All in defense of Google’s quite obvious IP theft: “Google v. Oracle America: “‘(A) current legal case within the United States related to the nature of computer code and copyright law. The dispute centers on the use of parts of the Java programming language’s application programming interfaces (APIs) which are owned by Oracle within early versions of the Android operating system by Google. Google has admitted to using the APIs….’ “Stop right there. “Google admits they used Oracle’s Java.  In fact Google used 11500 lines of Oracle’s Java code. “And Google used Oracle’s Java – to build its Android mobile operating system (OS).  Which is now the planet’s #1 most used OS.  They’ve maybe made a trillion dollars with it. “Google and Oracle were negotiating terms for licenses for Google’s use of Oracle’s 11500 lines of Java code.  Until one day Google…just stopped negotiating. “Google then released its Android OS.  With Oracle’s 11500 lines of Java – but without any licenses to use it. “And Oracle’s decade-long lawsuit ensued – which has now arrived before the Supreme Court.” How totally obvious is Google’s heist? The Email Where Google Admits They Stole the Intellectual Property to Build Android: “‘Lawyers defending Google against a patent and copyright lawsuit brought by Oracle are trying desperately to keep a particular engineer’s e-mail out of the public eye-but it looks like they’re unlikely to succeed. “‘The e-mail from Google engineer Tim Lindholm to the head of Google’s Android division Andy Rubin recommends that Google negotiate for a license to Java rather than pick an alternative system…. “‘The second paragraph of the email reads: “‘“What we’ve actually been asked to do by Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] (Google’s founders) is to investigate what technical alternatives exist to Java for Android and Chrome. “‘“We’ve been over a bunch of these and think they all suck. We conclude that we need to negotiate a license for Java under the terms we need.”’ Oops. So comparatively tiny tech company Oracle (Market Cap: $177 billion) is forced to waste a decade – and tons of money hiring a whole lot of lawyers. To attempt to defend itself against the massive heist of Big Tech Super Thief Google (Market Cap: $1.2 trillion). And we do mean MASSIVE. Google Stole Android and Probably Made a Trillion – They Should Pay Oracle Nine Billion Google has more than nine billion dollars in its petty cash drawer. But the money isn’t the main point.  The precedent is. A legal loss by Google’s armada of attorneys on a case of their stealing IP? Will mean Google’s armada of attorneys are more likely to lose future cases of their stealing IP. Which means Big Tech’s armadas of attorneys are more likely to lose future cases of their stealing IP. And then Google and Big Tech might have to…consider not stealing IP. The horror…the horror. And then what will become of all the lawyers?
