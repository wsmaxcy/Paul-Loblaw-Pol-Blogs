C, The Week in Bernie Memes, Steven Hayward, 2021-01-24, Okay it’s official: The Bernie Sanders Lawn Chair Memes have taken over the world. They’ve rocketed to the top of the socialist charts the best showing since 1917. This is the first time in recorded history that socialism has ever produced anything in abundance (except misery of course). Chris Christie’s beach chair escapade has been eclipsed and needless to say eclipsing Christie is no simple task! So this calls for a special TWiP edition to keep up because at the exponential growth rate of Bernie Memes by next Saturday Bernie Memes will take up fully half of the world’s cloud storage capacity.               The most fitting place for him.               Don’t cross the streams!     Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
