And yes excess deaths are pretty much what we always thought they were. But at least some of our excess vaccine might be dispatched abroad after all. Siri what is chutzpah? Should Chernobyl be a protected UNESCO World Heritage site? Simon says no book deals for Trump officials. Schuster concurs. Good news on the policing front: retrained Newark NJ cops didn’t fire a shot in all of 2020—and crime dropped. (Almost) bad news on the (sort-of) policing front: CA National Guard pilots were reportedly asked to keep a fighter jet at the ready to intimidate protesters. Alaska Airlines needs you to calm down ma’am. Reapportionment is happening. And it’s not quite as bad as expected. And needn’t necessarily be done as poorly as expected.
