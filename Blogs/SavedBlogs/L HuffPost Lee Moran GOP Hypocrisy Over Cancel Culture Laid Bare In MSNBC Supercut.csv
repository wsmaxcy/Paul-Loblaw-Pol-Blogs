L, GOP Hypocrisy Over 'Cancel Culture' Laid Bare In MSNBC Supercut, Lee Moran, 2021-05-12, MSNBC’s Brian Williams on Tuesday demonstrated how conservative complaints about so-called cancel culture are “just a culture war talking point.” “The 11th Hour” anchor aired a montage of GOP lawmakers and Fox News personalities whining about people being canceled. He contrasted it with the GOP’s imminent purge of Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from House leadership because she rejects ex-President Donald Trump’s election lies. “It’s hard to figure out what exactly to call this dynamic suddenly making somebody disappear” Williams said of Cheney’s looming ouster. “There’s a term for it. Oh yeah it’s the dynamic Republicans have been railing against.”
