L, Just Sayn' Rudy got a well deserved Razzie Award for Borat movie so I looked him up on IMDb, HalBrown, 2021-04-25,  I watched “The Out of Towners” staring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn with John Cleese in a small supporting role the other day and was surprised to see that Rudy Giuliani had a cameo playing himself. I won’t explain the circumstances in case you want to watch it. It is on Hulu. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie even though Rotten Tomatoes gave it 28/32% ratings. Today Salon published a story with a clever subtitle: I was wondering how many other movies and TV shows Rudy had cameos in so I looked him up on IMDb. What I found made interesting reading. (Donald Trump beats him in the cameo department.) I thought the last paragraph in his mini-bio calling him a liberal Republican was noteworthy: Giuliani a liberal Republican made a very poor showing in the 2008 race for the Republican Presidential nomination. His career is hardly through and history has yet to write its final pages on the former mayor of New York City. This also jumped out: “….history has yet to write its final pages on the former mayor of New York City.” Here are my bullet points (with my emphasis added) from the Trivia about him: The last of six quotes shows a Trumpian ignorance of the English language: [arguing for the invalidity of the 2020 election result] In the plaintiffs' counties they were denied the opportunity to have an unobstructed observation and ensure opacity. I'm not quite sure I know what opacity means. It probably means you can see right? At least he admits he’s not quite sure of the meaning of opacity when he defines it with the opposite of its meaning.
