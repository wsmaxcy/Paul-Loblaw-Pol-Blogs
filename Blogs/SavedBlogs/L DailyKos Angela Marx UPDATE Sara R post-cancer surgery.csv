L, UPDATE: Sara R post-cancer surgery, Angela Marx, 2021-04-29, Just a brief update on Sara R.  Biopsy results are back — no metastasis found! Which means they can detect no spread of the cancer at this time which is the very news all of us had been hoping for.   The oncology surgeon is pleased with the margins on the mass they removed.  The grafted skin is healing well checked by doppler regularly.  Sara is off the trach and is able to whisper a bit.  They let her eat REAL FOOD (okay applesauce) yesterday. The best of all — they may release her for home care TOMORROW on Friday!  Ann (winglion) has the house well in hand and spent most of two days wiping down and cleaning the entire home with a team in early today to really make sure it’s clean to reduce chances of any infections when Sara gets home.  I bought and had a small TV (32 inch) delivered and it’s already set up in Sara’s bedroom.     UPDATE for the UPDATE:  Sara herself just called me!!!  She’s sounds tired but is SO EXCITED to be going home on SUNDAY.  She sends her gratitude for all of the kind and loving words and thoughts of her friends here at Daily Kos which helped her immensely thru this ordeal.
