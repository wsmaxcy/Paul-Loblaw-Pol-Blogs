L, Follow the Example of Stacey Abrams. Deep Canvassing is the Key to VICTORY in 2022, Yosef 52, 2021-04-26, All of us here on DKos worked our hearts out for victory in 2020 and we succeeded in partnership with millions of others in ridding America of the most dangerous corrupt and incompetent “president” in the nation’s history. But arguably the person who did the most to save the American democratic republic was the incomparable Stacey Abrams. She and her organization again in partnership with committed Democrats of every description pulled off the seemingly impossible: not only winning Georgia for Biden but knocking off 2 Republican Senate seats in a run-off election the kind of election we almost never win in the South. How? Well yes we had an extensive air attack no doubt about it. But the key to victory was the Democratic ground game. Stacey Abrams and company canvassed Georgia to within an inch of its life achieving an ASTOUNDING voter turnout. It is this kind of effort we will need all over America STARTING NOW to retain control of the House and increase our control of the Senate (both of which we can do). The Republicans are already counting their chickens:  Democrats had best wake the hell up.While you think it’s about policy the GOP knows it’s about politics ground level bloody-minded knife-fighting politics.House GOP retreat: Lawmakers giddy about 2022 takeover https://t.co/Q6YGz3cnd7 via @politico  They think they’ve got this in the bag. I say: WE’LL DAMNED WELL SEE ABOUT THAT. There can be no let down in our GOTV efforts. We need to personally contact in a direct face-to-face manner every potential Democratic voter we can find. There must be no letdown as we saw in the disastrous 2010 midterm election. We must treat this as if it were a presidential year. And we have important work to do. THE HOUSE:  In California I see the potential for a gain of 5 Democratic seats. District numbers/boundaries will change depending on the re-map but I see Districts 21 22 25 39 and 48 as potential gains. (Take a look here and see what you think.) In New York I see the potential for a gain of 3 Democratic seats. Again the re-map will change things but I see Districts 2 11 and 22 as eminently flippable. (Take a look here.) In Iowa I see the potential for a gain of 2 Democratic seats in Districts 1 and 2 (one of which was decided by 6 votes in 2020). Yes Iowa. As in don’t write off Iowa. Tell me where you see possibilities of flipping Republican seats from R to D. THE SENATE: In 2022 there are 34 Senate seats up. Some 20 of these are Republican 14 Democratic. (Ballotpedia has a beautiful map and summary right here.) In my view Florida Pennsylvania Ohio North Carolina and Wisconsin are all prime targets. And we need to defend Raphael Warnock in Georgia. This is DOABLE. We have a chance to kick the vile hypocrite Marco Rubio out. We have a chance to throw out the vile TRAITOR Ron Johnson. We can do this. We can give President Biden a Senate that will be a reliable partner. Tell me YOUR Senate race priorities. GOVERNORSHIPS Our prime target is the horrible Ron DeSantis in Florida. Don’t listen to the naysayers and doomsayers who are spreading the lie that DeSantis is unbeatable. DeSantis can be removed. It will take huge efforts but it CAN be done—if we want it badly enough. Remember DeSantis is Trump with more intelligence. He’s already being groomed for 2024. We need to take him OUT. In Georgia Brian Kemp needs to GO. Let’s toss him out! In Arizona Doug Ducey is term limited. Let’s grab this seat! We need to defend Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan. Let’s do it! Tell me governor’s races YOU want to target. The Republicans have big plans. Little Lindsey Graham is making noises about impeaching Vice President Kamala Harris. The Republicans are ready to launch a whole series of bogus investigations. And of course crippling the Biden presidency is their #1 goal—even if it hurts America in the process. In fact they’re hoping that it DOES hurt America to turn people against President Biden. Oh and letting the Republicans win next year means that the Republicans got away with this: To which I say HELL NO!
