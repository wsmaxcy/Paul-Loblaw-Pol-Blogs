L, 'Here We Go': SCOTUS To Hear Mississippi Abortion Case , Frances Langum, 2021-05-17, Here it comes.  Now that Mitch McConnell has stolen one Supreme Court seat and filled two more with Heritage Foundation/Federalist Society loyalists NOW they're taking a major abortion case.   They've been sitting on this case for eight months waiting for their majority moment.  Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization v. Dobbs declares a 15-week gestational ban on abortion.  Until Amy Coney Barrett arrived on the high court such a ban was deemed unconstitutional.  This case has been tee'd up specifically and on purpose now that Barrett sits in a SCOTUS seat.  We MUST un-pack the court by adding justices who are not beholden to right wing nut jobs.  Who could have possibly imagined that dark-money ringer and accused rapist Brett Kavanaugh and theocratic shill Amy Coney Barrett would... oh wait everyone imagined it. https://t.co/5SQBGUrOdp ‚Äî Steve Silberman (@stevesilberman) May 17 2021 To be clear the Supreme Court is only poised to overturn Roe because of Amy Coney Barrett. Roberts sided with the liberals in a 5‚Äì4 abortion decision last summer (albeit begrudgingly and with qualifications). With Barrett's confirmation the court flipped against Roe and Casey. ‚Äî Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) May 17 2021 Angry Black Lady read the room last October.  Worth the click. In October I wrote about how Mississippi filed a brief with the Supreme Court that basically said "Dear Amy Coney Barrett Roe v. Wade makes me sad. Help." Weird part is that it was filed on pink scented paper. Very Legally Blonde. https://t.co/760eVw4ztE #TeamLegal ‚Äî ‚öìÔ∏èüö¢Imani Gandy üö¢‚öìÔ∏è (@AngryBlackLady) May 17 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
