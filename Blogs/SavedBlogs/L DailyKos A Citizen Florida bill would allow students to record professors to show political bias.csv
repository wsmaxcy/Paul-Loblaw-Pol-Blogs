L, Florida bill would allow students to record professors to show political bias, A Citizen, 2021-04-26, Guardian: Florida bill would allow students to record professors to show political bias  Republicans in Florida have stepped up their assault on what they call “Marxist professors and students” in the state’s public universities and colleges with a bill that encourages the reporting of lecturers perceived to be stifling “viewpoint diversity” on campus. The bill currently awaiting the signature of the Florida governor and Donald Trump ally Ron DeSantis will allow students to make recordings of lectures without their professors’ consent and present them as evidence of political bias. ***** “It’s a common joke [among] conservative students that they have to tailor some of their essays to make them more progressive or left-leaning to get a better grade. When there’s at least anecdotal evidence that people are concerned about action against them for their political viewpoints it’s an issue we’d like to collect some data on.” So Florida is going to have students acting as spies to weed out thought crimes. I doubt this law would be used against conservative professors — conservative views are going to just going to be seen as freedom of thought while liberal ideas will be reported as thought crime. This is Stalinist. They want professors to police their thoughts for fear that they will be turned in.  And the thing with conservative students claiming that their essays are being rejected that’s because they’re using falsehoods as fact. Just because Fox News says it doesn’t mean it is true. Conservatives just want a world where their ideas are unchallenged and they never hear anything other than conservative thought. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune for example gets called “The Red Star” and “Left of Mao” — they run George Will’s columns but conservatives hate it because you might read someone vaguely liberal. They want a “Ditto Rush” world.
