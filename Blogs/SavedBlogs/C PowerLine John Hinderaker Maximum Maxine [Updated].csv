C, Maximum Maxine [Updated], John Hinderaker, 2021-04-18, Maxine Waters one of the House’s most senior and looniest members is in Brooklyn Center Minnesota firing up the rioters there. In this clip she urges them to be more confrontational and to stay in the streets. She also demands a guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. Not guilty of manslaughter–“oh no no not manslaughter!”–but murder.  pic.twitter.com/O7EwvCtM3D — CrimeWatchMpls (@CrimeWatchMpls) April 18 2021  
I don’t suppose Mad Maxine has any idea what the evidence in the trial has been but her demands illustrate the impossibility of Derek Chauvin getting anything like a fair trial. UPDATE: The New York Post editorializes that Waters should be removed from office for inciting violence. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
