L, Top Dem GOP Senators Say They’re Working On $800 Billion Infrastructure Compromise, Nick Visser, 2021-04-19, Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Sunday they were working together on a revised $800 billion infrastructure package as part of a bipartisan effort to pass the legislation rather than see Democrats push it through alone over the outcry of Republicans. President Joe Biden unveiled a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure package last month that would be paid for in part by raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the global minimum tax. Republicans have largely rejected the bill for that reason while also blasting bill inclusions they say go beyond the scope of infrastructure. In an interview with Fox News Sunday Coons and Cornyn said they’d rather work together on a moderate package and go from there echoing other moderates’ calls for a negotiated bill. It’s unclear if other Democrats will buy into the smaller package which falls far short of what many in the party want to see. We should roll up our sleeves and find ways that both parties can support investments in infrastructure and U.S. competitiveness.

But the president has also said he’s “not open to doing nothing.” Last week Coons said he thought it was “likely” Democrats would pass large portions of Biden’s infrastructure plan via a process known as budget reconciliation which only requires a simple majority in the chamber. Democrats hold 50 votes in the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker and they have already used the process to pass the president’s massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package. “I do think it is likely that we will end up passing a lot of the president’s American Jobs plan through reconciliation” Coons told reporters last week. “But I think we should first do everything we reasonably can to negotiate bipartisan bills with our colleagues.”
