L, Friday News Dump: Tuckums Still Trying To Kill His Own Viewers And Other News, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-07, I've been watching Fox News strategy for a long long time and with Tucker literally pushing his audience to well kill themselves I conclude that 1) They no longer care about their viewing audience because they're old and dying off and 2) They see Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson as their future in maintaining political power and nihilistic young right-wingers love it. Profit! Remember: Fox doesn't make their profits off their anemic advertising. They make it from the cable companies who pay significantly more for Fox than other news channels because every time they try to change that lucrative arrangement Fox sics their angry viewers on them with a cry of "Big Tech is trying to stifle our voice!" Sean Hannity used to rule Fox. But in the post-Trump era Tucker Carlson is king | By Oliver Darcy https://t.co/6sIruoBp1H ‚Äî SafetyPin-Daily (@SafetyPinDaily) May 7 2021 What's important to understand here is Tucker is less in the persuasion business than the permission-and-modeling business. He's there to train his audience in the art of bad faith and make them feel good about using it. https://t.co/ooHYJc1jll ‚Äî Amanda Marcotte (@AmandaMarcotte) May 7 2021 Tucker Carlson is a public health threat. https://t.co/gj4cFtwQhg ‚Äî RC Di Mezzo (@rcdimezzo) May 7 2021 He got himself vaccinated as soon as he could.But every night on his #1 rated cable news show he scares the shit out of his audience when it comes to the vaccines and tells his audience NOT to get vaccinated.Tucker Carlson is a coward. ‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) May 6 2021 Big Pharma's lobbying juggernaut @PhRMA has all the time in the world to complain about the Biden admin trying to save lives and Democrats' efforts to reduce drug prices but can't spare a word about Tucker Carlson's relentless disinformation campaign.Why is that @steveubl? https://t.co/00ic5gZFJt pic.twitter.com/gDEhXir5mf ‚Äî Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) May 7 2021 ******************************************************************  NEW: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO says if @GovRonDeSantis won't let them  require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for passengers they'll take their cruise ships out of Florida. via @taydolven https://t.co/5fAvYMnzVc ‚Äî Mary Ellen Klas (@MaryEllenKlas) May 6 2021 Axios notes that 45‚Äôs hold over the GOP has only *grown* since Jan 6.The party is fully in thrall to a vulgar ignorant petty grifter who lost them both Congress and the White House readily jettisoning core positions on trade and foreign policy to do so.https://t.co/j7oXcOh0ov ‚Äî Helen Kennedy (@HelenKennedy) May 7 2021 Restaurants that laid people off right at the beginning of the pandemic that are now ramping up hiring and not realizing that people don't want to be abandoned again.
