C, Shapes of things (11), Scott Johnson, 2021-01-15, A reader working for a global tech company writes to offer the following speculation on the meaning of “full retro” in Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s comments here:  [I]t is possible that Dorsey is referring to a part of the “agile” software development methodology called a retrospective or “retro.” A retro is a meeting or series of meetings that look back on a project or portion of a project in order to assess what went right and what went wrong and to then use that information to adjust how you work going forward. If that is what he is actually referring to it is a fairly benign statement –only indicating that he plans on getting together with some folks to look at what they did how they did it and whether or not they should do something different going forward. It seems like a provisionally reasonable explanation though I am not sure it sufficiently takes account of the context. As I say more to come. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
