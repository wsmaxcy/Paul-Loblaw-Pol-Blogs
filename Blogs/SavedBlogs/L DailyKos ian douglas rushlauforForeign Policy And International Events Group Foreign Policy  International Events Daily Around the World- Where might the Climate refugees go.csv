L, Foreign Policy / International Events Daily: Around the World- Where might the Climate refugees go?, ian douglas rushlauforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-07-02, Welcome to the daily presentation at “Foreign Policy and International Events Group” aka FP&IE. Join us on todays journey. Share links and stories of your discoveries and thought. Who are we and what we are trying do → Launching A Dailykos Discussions and Republishing Group For International or Foreign Policy Stuff We use sources and links that might not be familiar to most kossacks what with this being a Foreign Policy and International stuffs group and all. So press right mouse button on links and open in new incognito/private tab/window to reduce your tensions somewhat. Last week I wrote a diary about staggering extremes of heat experienced in what are supposed to be the coldest places on Earth. And I posed some questions: What happens when in a few decades the geophysical characteristics and climate of a place is altered precipitously? What happens to the humans the animals the plants the land itself? In that diary I shared a reference to a term that was new to me- ecocide: This week legal experts defined and put forward a new proposed category of international crime - ‘ecocide.’ If taken up by Parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) it would become the fifth category of offences to be prosecuted under the court alongside war crimes crimes against humanity genocide and the crime of aggression. This landmark move is symbolic of a global trend in increased proposals and developments in environmental law. New solutions approaches and ideas to the planetary crisis are emerging and governments are increasingly putting nature and front and center including recognizing the rights of nature.  More and more climate migrants are showing up at borders. Laws need to catch up"The World Bank projects that climate change will drive 143 million people in Latin America Africa and South Asia alone to leave their homes by 2050.” https://t.co/qBdduUKji7 pic.twitter.com/Fr5177k0CU  No one knows exactly how many climate migrants exist now or how many people will become climate migrants in the future but current estimates are high. In the coming years the rapid pace of climate change combined with a global population nearing 8 billion people is likely to create unprecedented stress around the world. Recent studies show that dry spells and drought are already associated with increased migration. Disasters caused more than 23 million people a year to relocate over the past decade the majority of them within their own countries according to the World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Global Climate Report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that this will increase as global warming intensifies. The World Bank projects that climate change will drive 143 million people in Latin America Africa and South Asia alone to leave their homes by 2050. Many come from poor regions that have contributed little to global warming.  As more climate migrants cross borders seeking refuge laws will need to adapt Climate change is upending people’s lives but when droughts floods or sea level rise force them to leave their countries they often find closed borders & little assistancehttps://t.co/2br7l7imrn Tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions) of climate refugees will need to be resettled in the decades ahead as much of the world becomes uninhabitable. Where will they go? “For much of the population who are forcibly displaced in #refugee contexts #climatechange is a contributing factor” says ⁦⁦⁦@TowerAmali⁩ founder & director of the advocacy organization ⁦Climate Refugees”🙏🏽 ⁦@clurelisa⁩ @grist⁩ https://t.co/9Q9jwgFztb  Whether it’s within or across national borders most migrants’ journeys will end in cities. Urban areas house 56 percent of the world’s population (that’s expected to reach 70 percent by 2050) 60 percent of its refugees and 80 percent of internally displaced people. Outside of planned relocation efforts it’s difficult to pinpoint which cities will experience the greatest influx or which places might be hit by disasters that will cause displacement. That combined with the barriers of working within and around national and international immigration policy limits the degree to which cities can prepare. “Denying climate change or denying that millions of people will migrate because of climate does not allow for that preparation” says Thanu Yakupitiyage a migrants-rights activist who is the U.S. communications director for 350.org (and 2020 Grist 50 honoree).  82.4 million #refugees are forcibly displaced due to #climate #conflict & #persecution ⬆️4% during the #Covid19 pandemic. Yet 160 states closed borders 99 making no exceptions for protection. Many were expelled; facing harsher restrictions in global lockdowns #WorldRefugeeDay pic.twitter.com/NzCO8zQSs5 As I noted in last week’s diary and not surprisingly the immediate practical effects of climate change are impacting the world’s most vulnerable populations first and most severely: Preparing for a Warmer World: Towards a Global Governance System to Protect Climate Refugees Frank Biermann and Ingrid Boas Global Environmental Politics 2010 Distinguishing between climate refugees migrants and emigrants according to the degree of “voluntariness” of their relocation would artificially minimize the scale of the problem and could create different levels of protection and support without much basis in political legal or ethical criteria. A large group of people who managed to relocate in time because of information from climate scenarios experiences with repeated extreme weather events or political intervention such as through resettlement programs would be denied the status of “refugees” but would rather be classified as people who voluntarily opted to leave their land. This could place these people outside any (future) global governance mechanism that regulates the recognition protection resettlement and compensation of people who have to make way to climate change. In sum adopting voluntariness as a defining criterion would be either analytically not useful or morally dubious. (pg. 65) It is likely that most refugees from extreme weather events and sea-level rise will come from Africa and Asia. Asia is at high risk of extreme weather events and sea-level rise and will also be severely affected by drought and water scarcity. Africa is especially vulnerable to drought and water scarcity but many regions are also at high risk of sea-level rise. Latin America is especially at risk of water stress and drought.

Stepping up collaborative inclusive evidence-based action for #protection & #solutions. #displacement #resilience #adaptation #HumanRights https://t.co/Kwntzj6DFe pic.twitter.com/TbYCniqUs3  Refugees and IDPs are often highly exposed and vulnerable to climate-related shocks and environmental degradation.20 In hosting areas and in areas of return climate and environmental risks may add to humanitarian and protection needs and operational complexities including through onward repeated and protracted displacement as well as through restricting freedom of movement and access to humanitarian assistance. Climate shocks and environmental degradation may also aggravate existing tensions or conflict further exacerbating vulnerabilities and displacement… Those without the means and resources to anticipate and adequately prepare and whose governments may be unable or unwilling to adequately protect them tend to have the greatest needs for protection. Most remain within their countries of residence but some cross international borders and many may be caught in prolonged or repeated cycles of displacement.
