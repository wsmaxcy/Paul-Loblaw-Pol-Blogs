C, Sunday morning talking heads , Allahpundit, 2021-04-18, This morning on the Sunday shows brings us a visit from not one but two Ghosts of the Republican Party Past. George W. Bush makes a rare return to national politics on “CBS This Morning” where he’ll discuss his op-ed this week on how to solve America’s immigration crisis. Fifteen years ago he championed legalization for illegals and 15 years later nothing’s changed: One place to start is DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Americans who favor a path to citizenship for those brought here as children known as “dreamers” are not advocating open borders. They just recognize that young men and women who grew up in the United States and who never knew any other place as home are fundamentally American. And they ought not be punished for choices made by their parents… As for the millions of undocumented men and women currently living in the United States a grant of amnesty would be fundamentally unfair to those who came legally or are still waiting their turn to become citizens. But undocumented immigrants should be brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which legal residency and citizenship must be earned as for anyone else applying for the privilege. Requirements should include proof of work history payment of a fine and back taxes English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and civics and a clean background check. We should never forget that the desire to live in the United States — a worldwide and as powerful an aspiration as ever — is an affirmation of our country and what we stand for. Over the years our instincts have always tended toward fairness and generosity. The reward has been generations of grateful hard-working self-reliant patriotic Americans who came here by choice. He’ll be asked to explain what makes him think there are enough Republican votes in the Senate to make this happen post-Trump when there weren’t enough pre-Trump. Elsewhere John Boehner will chat with “Meet the Press” and “State of the Union” about his new book in which he describes what a pain in the ass the tea party was how much he hates Ted Cruz and his … complicated feelings about the last Republican president. Other than Bush and Boehner this morning it’s basically Fauci Fauci and more Fauci. He’ll appear on “This Week” “Meet the Press” “Face the Nation” and “State of the Union” to try to stop the bleeding in public confidence in Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine after the FDA’s controversial decision to “pause” it over blood-clot fears. He’ll also give us a sense of when we can expect J&J back on the market. Hopefully this week. But maybe not. Finally UN ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield a.k.a. “the Ambassador of Blame America First” will join “Face the Nation” to explain why she made her own country sound worse in a speech to the UN Human Rights Council than the various degenerate regimes that populate that body. The full line-up is at the LA Times.
