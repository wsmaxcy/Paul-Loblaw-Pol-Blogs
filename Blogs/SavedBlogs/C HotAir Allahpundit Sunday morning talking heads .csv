C, Sunday morning talking heads , Allahpundit, 2021-04-11, America’s neverending “Infrastructure Week” is the chief topic on this morning’s Sunday shows as Team Biden tries to convince the public to spend a few trillion more dollars before Democrats lose control of government next year. It’ll be energy secretary Jennifer Granholm for “This Week” and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on “State of the Union” and “Fox News Sunday.” (Buttigieg’s placement on Fox is no coincidence as he gained a reputation among lefties for having performed especially well there during campaign interviews last year.) If you can’t catch them today no worries: They’ll be on every Sunday from now until a bill passes to hammer the message that a giant social-welfare slush fund is actually “infrastructure” somehow. The juicier parts of this morning’s programming will happen on other shows. “Face the Nation” is the one to watch as Gretchen Whitmer and Liz Cheney are both scheduled. Whitmer will be pressed on the freakish spiraling outbreak in her home state and why she hasn’t yet ordered a lockdown. She’ll also take the opportunity to once again beg the White House publicly to send extra doses of vaccines to Michigan to speed up immunization. Hopefully she’ll be pressed about this: When Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) last week asked White House officials if they would consider sending more vaccine doses to her state during a deadly surge the state appeared not to have ordered 360000 doses then available — a single-day snapshot that nonetheless puzzled federal officials who advised her to work with experts to make sure Michigan’s supply was being deployed effectively. Is Michigan short on vaccines or is Whitmer’s administration just slow to deploy its existing supply? As for Cheney she’ll be on to make the case against the White House’s infrastructure plan but will doubtless also be asked about the uh predicament in which her nemesis Matt Gaetz currently finds himself. She’ll probably dodge questions about the criminal investigation into his conduct by reminding everyone that he’s innocent until proven guilty but I’m curious to see how she reacts to a question about him allegedly showing off nude pics of his sexual conquests to colleagues. Had she ever heard rumors about that? What does she think of that behavior? If other members of the caucus confirm it should he be punished somehow? The other guests of note this morning are all Republicans. “Fox News Sunday” will host Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. John Thune. Abbott will discuss the exploding migrant crisis at the border and his state’s steady decline in COVID cases after he lifted its mask mandate a move Biden derided at the time as dangerous “Neanderthal” thinking. Thune meanwhile will be asked about Trump’s influence over the Senate GOP and next year’s primaries mindful of the fact that Trump has called for Thune himself to be ousted from office. Finally Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson will chat with “State of the Union” about his decision to veto the state’s new law banning gender transition treatments for minors. (That veto has now been overridden.) The full line-up is at the AP.
