L, June Jobs Report Destroys GOP Talking Points, John Amato, 2021-07-02, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  The US economy added 850000 new jobs in June beating Wall Street's predictions and crushing Republican talking points. "From a market perspective this was an all-out positive jobs report” said Seema Shah chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in a CNBC report.  “The improvement today likely reflects a slight easing of the labor supply constraints that have been holding back the jobs market in recent months as well as continued momentum from the economic reopening." As Duncan wryly states "+850K jobs means job killing inflation!" Still there's never a bad time for Republicans to claim tax cuts are the answer to all our problems. Senator Chuck Grassley's latest tweet became an instant laughingstock.

Do you really think anybody believes this discredited Reaganomics crap anymore? https://t.co/2VI0RgxMaN — Thom Hartmann (@Thom_Hartmann) July 2 2021 Others piled on: Seems unlikely- the last Q1 of Trump’s presidency- before covid came was already showing weakness. Tax breaks for the wealthy don’t stimulate the economy. https://t.co/u8gBDR3rXR — Prairie Godzilla (@KatemootAdams) July 2 2021  pic.twitter.com/OZlgMcNj22 — #RIPGOP ™ (@_ReaalAmerican_) July 2 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
