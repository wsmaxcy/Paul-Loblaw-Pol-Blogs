L, Previous guy's insurrection part Deux needs his suing his way back onto Twitter & Facebook, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-07-07, One key to the second Trump insurrection is his return to Twitter and Facebook with something something about Google because ‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äù is the latest Trump demon meme.¬† Because GOP traitors like Chip Roy have called for 18 more months of chaos there‚Äôs more Trumpian lawfare nonsense and nuisance that serve as a delaying action while the actual prosecution lumbers on in other areas. More dangerous is the attempt by trumpians to consolidate enough military force to make another futile attempt to overthrow the elected government. Trump‚Äôs delusion is that the National Guard in the US operates¬†like national guards in other nations more susceptible to military coups. This is a delusion fueled by some vets especially Oath Keepers and other trumpists in some police forces. Trump believes that the token efforts of GOP governors to send law enforcement to the southern border in Texas will signal a quasi-military force pre-positioned to execute a coup. He likely thinks that every anti-vaxxing member of the military counts toward his anti-democratic unconstitutional¬†‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô army. Another element of that is Trump trying to get back on Facebook and Twitter to mobilize RW public opinion. The problem is that using ‚ÄúSection 230...¬†a section of the United States Communications Decency Act that generally provides immunity for website platforms from third-party content.‚Äù is looking for a technicality going back to 1996 that likely could not be ruled on by SCOTUS immediately if at all.  It's an instrument to control the press that might be more easily enforceable under martial law bringing us back to attempts to subvert the constitution with seditious military force. It only works if there‚Äôs enough chaos and an understanding of Putin‚Äôs hybrid war principles. Press suppression comes after vote suppression and comes after seizing power. Since 1/6 we‚Äôve been lucky that with all the moving parts that the trumpist insurrectionists¬†failed because they were incompetent. Had they taken hostages killed more people and set off their pipe bombs things might have been different  You might think they should but legally that is not the case. The title of 230 contains the phrase "Protection for private blocking and screening".. guess what it's designed to protect. It's protects traditional editorial functions.  I support Twitters First Amendment right to ban users and remove content. Even if done in a biased way. The way I see it...Moderation is a company saying "you can't do that here".Censorship is the Government  saying "you can't do that anywhere".  Federal troops primarily National Guardsmen have been stationed at the border for three years now at a cost of $840 million to the Defense Department. https://t.co/hHnqf1sCIN  To date the US has spent over $15 billion on the militarization of police. How did local police get all of these military weapons and why do they need them? pic.twitter.com/cVkwDtbjv8  Trump spoke in ‚Äúcode‚Äù again. He wanted 10000 troops on 6 January he just didn‚Äôt want to save¬†any Democrats hence those deployment delays and a blame-shifting lie about telling Pelosi anything.  NEW: Trump expressed so much interest in using active duty troops in response to the protests after the killing of George Floyd that White House aides drafted a proclamation for him to sign to invoke the Insurrection Act.  w/@maggieNYT https://t.co/KDls4HcYcJ Trump said he requested "10000 National Guardsmen" for his Jan. 6 rally but Pelosi "rejected it." A news article reported that Trump told the acting defense secretary the night before the rally that he thought 10000 National Guard troops would be needed but he did not make any clear request for 10000 troops. Pelosi‚Äôs spokesman said she was not consulted about the National Guard before Jan. 6. And the former House sergeant-at-arms who reported to Pelosi testified that he had no discussions about National Guard troops with any congressional leaders before Jan. 6. Without evidence to back it we rate Trump‚Äôs statement False. www.politifact.com/... For all the chaos criminality and consequential incompetence we endured during his presidency that we know about we still have only scratched the surface as to all the bullets we narrowly dodged.  This Oath Keepers indictment is wild. They were just waiting for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act.‚Äúwe will also have well armed & equipped QRF1 teams on standby...in [case] the President calls us up as part of the militia to to assist him inside DC.‚Äùhttps://t.co/bCoZ8tjT4c pic.twitter.com/u0peXIQAlr  I've had my work featured on MSNBC before but I've never been a guest -- and I'm excited to say that changes tonight! Please tune in to @thereidout w/ @JoyAnnReid at 7:15 EST. I'll be discussing my viral Chip Roy clip and breaking another big story... üòÄhttps://t.co/D09muLU37d   For every Republican member of Congress who was ushered out of the chambers as Trump‚Äôs mob was seizing the Capitol on 1/6 shame on them for whitewashing what happened to THEM.  I‚Äôve skimmed former guy‚Äôs complaint against Facebook and it‚Äôs every bit as stupid as you‚Äôd think it is.  Yeah so you‚Äôd think   TIME reports that Erik Prince met with Ukrainian associates last year to discuss a $10 billion plan to make weapons and hire Ukraine‚Äôs combat veterans into a private military company.The status of Prince's plan is unclear per the report.https://t.co/Wr3kVUFJVi  You know Matt Gaetz is rushing out to file that bill. üòí   .@AlanDersh has turned into such a pathetic performative sniveling sycophant. It is one of the dumbest lawsuits ever filed and has ZERO chance of succeeding which he knows. What a scumbag. I still can‚Äôt wait for Ghislaine to eventually rat him and his orange faced hero out. https://t.co/KNKvJKwc0W    Trump‚Äôs lawsuits against Facebook Twitter YouTube and their CEOs for banning him from their platforms are doomed to fail because private actors are not subject to First Amendment. I will discuss with @AliVelshi @peterbakernyt and @roninsana at 11 pm ET on @11thHour on @MSNBC.    Tomorrow I‚Äôm suing Fox News for not having me on every day and the NY Times for not publishing my OpEds because First Amendment.Awww just kidding. Unlike delusional Dershowitz I read the First Amendment and it does not apply to private sector companies. https://t.co/rispvQuxDk
