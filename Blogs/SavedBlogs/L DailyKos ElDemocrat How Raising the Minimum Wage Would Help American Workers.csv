L, How Raising the Minimum Wage Would Help American Workers?, ElDemocrat, 2021-04-29, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that will raise the hourly minimum wage to $15 for federal contractors by 2022. “The executive action will increase the pay of hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers” said the White House. The current minimum wages act sits at $7.25 has not been raised in a decade.  Raising the minimum wage to $15 hourly has been a top priority of many Democrats and it would help many Americans especially the people of color get access to better healthcare housing and pull-out millions of American families out of poverty. The cost of living in the US is increasing significantly and many citizens feel that rising costs of living is the biggest threat to their financial security. Income is at the top of the list if we look at the conditions that impact health. An inadequate income leads to psychological stress and by raising the minimum wage can reduce people's risk of mental illness and children’s mental health. The intention of the minimum wage was to create a minimum standard of living to protect the health and well-being of workers. It would increase the income of 17 million workers. It is an opportunity to reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. Half of the Americans get their health insurance through their employer. Health care is getting more expensive for both the individuals and the employers. For example if an employee is working 2000 hours per year a $1 increase in the minimum wage would result in $1 decrease in employer-provided health insurance. Minimum wage policy has long been discussed as a mechanism for raising income and alleviating poverty. I can tell you that a well-paying job translates to a longer life. For example researchers in 2016 found that 1% of rich men in the U.S. lives 14.6 years more than the 1% of poor men. Study after study has linked higher income to better health. Inequality in the US remains one of the biggest concerns of all time and raising the minimum wage would help eradicate that. It would increase the standard of living decrease poverty rate and help close racial and gender gap in the United States.  Raising the minimum wage will also stimulate consumer spending help businesses and grow economy. Overall it will have a positive impact on American economy and help American workers fight poverty and financial inequality.
