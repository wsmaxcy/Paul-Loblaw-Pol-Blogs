L, Vaccine Reluctance and its Solution, Old Verger, 2021-04-19, The current Covid vaccination campaign has one ultimate objective: to obtain herd immunity. And at that point life can return to normal. And now the vaccines are widely available for anybody who wants them. Our way out is here. Unfortunately  a lot of people (mostly Republicans) don’t plan to get vaccinated. And many of those same people refuse to wear a mask or follow the other CDC mitigation guidelines. It’s not a good situation because vaccination is the best way to end the pandemic. O.K. so be it. It’s not the only way. There are other things we can do to bring about herd immunity. These steps can slow the spread of the virus in lieu of universal vaccination. Yes unvaccinated people will die. But that comes about as a result of their own choices. And their deaths will also help the rest of us to reach the ultimate goal of herd immunity.
