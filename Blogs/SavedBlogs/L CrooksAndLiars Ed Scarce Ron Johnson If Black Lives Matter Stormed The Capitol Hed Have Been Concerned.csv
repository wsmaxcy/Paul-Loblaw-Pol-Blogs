L, Ron Johnson: If Black Lives Matter Stormed The Capitol He'd Have Been 'Concerned', Ed Scarce, 03-13-21, Wisconsin's embarrassment outdid himself in a radio interview this week saying "had the tables been turned and President Trump won the election and tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and antifa I might have been a little concerned." The riot left 5 dead and 140 police officers injured as well as a vandalized Capitol building but Ron Johnson would have felt threatened if Black people had done it. Newsflash for Ron Johnson Black people would never do what those "patriots" did because they'd have been shot dead on the spot. Meanwhile his "patriots" just blatantly attacked the American system of government and fully expected to get away with it without any consequences whatsoever. Wisconsin get rid of this asshole. Enough. Source: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel MADISON - U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is facing accusations of racism after saying the supporters of former President Donald Trump who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January didn't worry him but that he might have been concerned if they had been supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.    "I knew those were people who love this country that truly respect law enforcement would never do anything to break the law so I wasn't concerned" Johnson said about the predominantly white crowd that marched to the U.S. Capitol to overturn a presidential election and triggered an assault that left five people dead 140 police officers injured and windows smashed.  "Now had the tables been turned and Joe — this is going to get me in trouble — had the tables been turned and President Trump won the election and tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and antifa I might have been a little concerned" Johnson said during an interview with syndicated radio show host Joe "Pags" Pagliarulo. Blatant racism from @RonJohnsonWI here. He says he wasn’t worried on 1/6 because the majority-white insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol “love this country” but says if they were Black Lives Matter protestors he would’ve been concerned for his safety. #WISen pic.twitter.com/V3gm4cLw8v — American Bridge 21st Century (@American_Bridge) March 12 2021 Senator Ron Johnson saw the Auschwitz Hoodie Guy and felt comforted that the rioters loved their country. Had that guy have had dreads and a Colin Kaepernick hoodie Ron would have hid under his desk. — Mr. Newberger (@jeremynewberger) March 13 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
