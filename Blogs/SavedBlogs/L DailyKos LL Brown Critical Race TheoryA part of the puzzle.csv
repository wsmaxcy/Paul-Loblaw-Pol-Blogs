L, Critical Race Theory:A part of the puzzle, LL Brown, 2021-06-27, Sitting in air conditioning and bored so I tune in to NewsMax for some input from the wild side. The talking head in the suit is spouting CRT blather and how it becoming an plague upon the people of iowa. One would think he was warning of biblical  grasshoppers or cornworms.  The screen shows the above slide and next thing he sounds like Sen McCarthy and John Wayne warning about communist under my bed.  Not having a quick grasp of the graph and the "indoctrination" and the kerfufil & CRT I went duck/ducking. Mostly I was puzzled what phrases got his knickers all twisted. Seems like Newmax is all upset about some material prepared to assist teachers in helping ALL of the students about comprehend the current state of events. Most of the material appears to have been de-webbed but FOX news did preserve a copy of the PDF were the above slide came from. static.foxnews.com/…  The next link is an article from education week.   " What Is Critical Race Theory and Why Is It Under Attack. " www.edweek.org/… I don't have a good handle CRT trope from MAGAland yet however I get the sense it will add to a long hot summer. Hopefully this might help some others understand what's a foot in MAGAland.
