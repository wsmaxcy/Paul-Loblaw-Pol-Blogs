L, Kimmel Remembers When Trump Said He'd 'Do Something Else' If He Lost, Frances Langum, 2021-06-11, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  As we say on The Professional Left Podcast "memory is the liberal superpower." We also note that the right-wing's favorite whine is "no fair remembering stuff!"    pic.twitter.com/8T0tyqOJ1l â€” Charming Bastard (@StarlingBuchan1) June 7 2021 So thank the gods for Jimmy Kimmel's staff who put together "This Week in Covid History" as a reminder of where we were one short year ago. A year ago this week the segment's favorite target Laura Ingraham was harping on where the second wave of Covid19 was?  (It was weeks away LAURA.)   And Joe Biden speaking as a candidate from the tv studio in his home (fun fact: just like Hannity's) noted that Trump would cheat to win the 2020 election and declare any loss illegitimate.   To which RNC's Ronna Romney McDaniel said poppycock and how dare he indulge in conspiracy theories!   Thanks Jimmy Kimmel and staff.  You're superheroes against the memory hole.   Jimmy Kimmel's: One year ago: "This Week in Covid History" is as terrific as David Letterman's "Great Moments in Presidential Speeches" montage of W. Bush's of struggle with English language. Amazing the CRAZY we've forgotten in one year ðŸ¥´ â€” Diana Arlet (@diana_arlet) June 3 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
