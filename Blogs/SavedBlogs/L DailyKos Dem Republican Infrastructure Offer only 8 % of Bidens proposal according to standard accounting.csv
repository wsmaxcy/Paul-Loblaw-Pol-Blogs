L, Republican Infrastructure "Offer" only 8 % of Biden's proposal according to standard accounting, Dem, 2021-04-27, Republicans never make serious offers or negotiate in good faith with the Democratic Party leaders. Their objective is never to achieve what’s best for the nation ; their goal is always to obstruct when a democrat is in the White House in order to achieve political victories. We’ve seen this time and again. This was true when President Obama and a Democratic Party controlled Congress was trying to lead the nation out of a republican led terrible recession. It’s true now. We can see that in the percentage of President Biden’s proposal that the republican proposal makes up.   If I want to sell my car for $10000 and someone offers me $2500 that’s not a serious negotiation.  In fact writes columnist Catherine Rampell “this lowball bid is even lower than it first appears once you realize how Republicans rigged the accounting.” The White House took the standard budgeting approach: counting only new money beyond current spending trends. Republicans though are taking credit for this “baseline” spending as their own.   Catherine Rampbell continues:  But in reality Republicans are offering nothing remotely close to a serious or reasonable counter-bid and they know it. This is obvious from their use of an accounting gimmick that inflates their “compromise” and makes it look more similar in size to Biden’s plan. Once you un-cook the books and use apples-to-apples budgeting rules to compare the proposals you’ll realize that what the GOP has offered is mere pennies on the dollar of what Biden has requested. Specifically Republicans have offered to tender 8 cents of new spending for every $1 Biden wants. Even less in some cases.  See the White House proposal had been framed as new infrastructure money on top of whatever the government was already expected to spend on roads bridges airports broadband etc. if existing laws and programs continue without changes. (Budget wonks usually call this “baseline” spending.) The Republican plan by contrast takes credit for all this already scheduled spending when calculating its total. That’s significant because the “baseline” spending (roughly $379 billion over the next five years) represents almost all of what Republicans have offered up. Once you strip out this already expected spending the entire GOP plan is a mere $189 billion of new money.  If we want a serious effort at improving our infrastructure which is not only badly needed but will also boost the economy then we can’t waste negotiating with ourselves or waste time by taking seriously offers from republicans which were not made in good faith.
