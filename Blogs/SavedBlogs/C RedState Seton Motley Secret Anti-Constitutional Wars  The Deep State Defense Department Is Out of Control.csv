C, Secret Anti-Constitutional Wars?  The Deep State Defense Department Is Out of Control, Seton Motley, 2020-11-16, A little over a month ago we wrote this: The Deep State Military-Industrial-Complex Looks to Expand Its ‘Unwarranted Influence’: “On his way out the (White House) door in 1961 (Dwight) Eisenhower gave his famous Military-Industrial-Complex speech.  In which (in part) he warned: “‘We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions…. “‘In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence …by the Military-Industrial-Complex…. “‘Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime…. “’We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes…. “‘The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists.  And will persist.’ “This is Eisenhower – predicting the Deep State Swamp.  Which is some serious Nostradamus-esque shot calling.” We wrote this – because of this: “Implications of a Government-Run 5G Network: “‘The Pentagon’s recent Request for Information resurfaces a costly and unfeasible idea that the Trump administration has considered in the past: a government-built and operated 5G network. “‘Calls for a nationalized 5G network are motivated both by a national security and an economic component. “‘Besides the obvious and concerning fact that it would require billions of new tax dollars to deploy there are some serious security implications that deserve further consideration.’ “The Deep State Swamp has kept this terrible idea alive.  Via people Trump should have long ago fired. “Trump Team Mulls Nationalized 5G Network to Counter China: “‘National security officials working for President Donald Trump are considering building a superfast 5G network….’ “Pentagon Awards $600 Million to Spearhead 5G Experiments Across Five Military Bases “They even snuck it into Trump’s reelect platform. “Trump Campaign Proposes ‘National’ 5G “These Deep State clowns – are actually working against the actual ‘Trump Team.’” This is the Trump Administration repeatedly expressing its opposition to government 5G.  And the Defense Department repeatedly moving ahead with it anyway: “(L)anguage in a Sep. 18 request for information from the Defense Department raised the eyebrows of lawmakers across the political spectrum reigniting outrage over an idea – originally floated at the start of 2018 – that the government should build and control 5G networks.” This is Third World banana republic military junta stuff. Pentagon Expanding 5G Efforts DOD Official Says: “The Pentagon is pushing ahead on a variety of 5G projects with more proposal requests on the way despite concerns over what role the Defense Department should have in building and controlling 5G networks.” Note this Big Media outlet doesn’t mention the concerns we Constitutional republic lovers have with the military countermanding multiple direct expressions of opposition from their civilian bosses. How clueless is Big Media about how our President is the military’s Commander-in-Chief?: “A recent survey noted a lack of support from stakeholders was an impediment for federal agencies implementing 5G capabilities but that’s mostly on the civilian side of things.” Ummm…the civilians run the military here in the US.  The civilian opposition – is all that actually matters. Does the Defense Department’s serial unconstitutional insubordination stop here?  Heavens no. US Envoy to Syria Brags About Lying to President Trump About US Troop Levels: “Throughout his presidency President Trump has tried to end the ‘Forever War’ we have going on in Southwest Asia and has had precious little success. “Now in the last days of the first Trump administration we are finding out that not only were President Trump’s instructions ignored but he was actually lied to by senior officials. “Four years after signing the now-infamous ‘Never Trump’ letter condemning then-presidential candidate Donald Trump as a danger to America retiring diplomat Jim Jeffrey…(now) acknowledges that his team routinely misled senior leaders about troop levels in Syria. “‘“We were always playing shell games to not make clear to our leadership how many troops we had there” Jeffrey said in an interview. The actual number of troops in northeast Syria is “a lot more than” the roughly two hundred troops Trump initially agreed to leave there in 2019.’” “‘Trump’s…withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria remains perhaps the single-most controversial foreign policy move during his first years in office and for Jeffrey “the most controversial thing in my fifty years in government.”’” Ummm…no.  “The most controversial thing” is you horse posteriors ignoring a direct order from the Commander-in-Chief we elected in part to reduce troops in Syria – and not reducing troops in Syria: “‘For Jeffrey the incident was far less cut-and-dry — but it is ultimately a success story that ended with U.S. troops still operating in Syria denying Russian and Syrian territorial gains and preventing ISIS remnants from reconstituting.’” Get that?  This is the Defense Department initiating unilateral wars. “(D)enying Russian and Syrian territorial gains and preventing ISIS remnants from reconstituting” – means shooting at them. Without the Commander-in-Chief’s order to do so. And in direct opposition to the Commander-in-Chief’s order to get the heck out of there. All of this is Third World banana republic military junta stuff.
