L, Nonfiction Views: Solved: How the World's Cities are Fixing the Climate Crisis, DebtorsPrisonforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-06-29, As much as I’d like it to be true I found the title of former Toronto mayor David Miller’s 2020 Solved: How the World's Great Cities Are Fixing the Climate Crisis to be a bit overly optimistic. I needed to look no further than my own moving day on June 16th from Sedona Arizona where the temperature hit 106 degrees despite the 4500 feet elevation to Phoenix where the temperature that day was 115. Yes I tipped the three moving men well. This is not to say I didn’t find the book interesting and even inspiring. Miller is also the Director of international Diplomacy and Global Ambassador of Inclusive Climate Action at the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group an organization which devotes itself to decreasing our carbon footprint despite its fondness for bloated job titles. The main thesis of Miller and of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is that city governments are better equipped to take quick and effective action against climate change than state and national governments. In general cities have greater direct control over many of the issues that most affect the environment: zoning building codes park spaces utilities traffic patterns waste management public health and more. City governments have a more direct link to the population that elected them than do regional state or national politicians making them more accountable and better able to canvas local issues. City governments are generally more agile in passing regulations than state or national governments. Cities often most directly suffer the consequences of climate change and thus have high motivation to tackle the problem. And the great number of cities increases the number of potential ‘incubators of innovation’ as the expression goes. Their goals are modest: limiting the growth in global warming to the bare-minimum holding pattern of 1.5 degrees Celsius theoretically necessary to stave off total disaster. Their belief that actions taken by cities alone can achieve that goal is based on the fact that the 97 affiliated urban areas  in C40 account for 25% of global GDP and 12% of the population. It’s still very challenging. The book devotes several pages to Austin Texas and the work they’ve done starting with the 2007 City Council resolution to “make Austin the leading city in the nation in the effort to reduce the impacts of global warming.” They have indeed achieved some remarkable goals and instituted some great policies and yet a few months after the book was published the city suffered devastating blackouts along with much of Texas during the ‘historic’ freezing temperatures this past winter.  Leaving aside the idiot conservatives who expressed glee in the belief it discredited alternative energy policies the blackouts demonstrated how events can overtake even good policies and intentions. Solved is filled with dozens of examples of actions and experiments being undertaken by cities around the world. Vancouver is creating embedded emissions standards for builders (that is the emissions created by the manufacture of the construction materials used beyond simply standards for the energy efficiency of the building itself.) London has vowed to allow only zero-emission buildings by 2050 and has engaged in a rapid deployment of vehicle charging stations. Accra Ghana has expanded garbage transfer stations to serve impoverished areas of the city that had relied on emissions-producing informal dumps; at the same time they worked to find employment for the informal waste collectors who labored within that system. In Addis Ababa Ethiopia where 60% of the population normally goes to its destination on foot but which is also experiencing sprawling informal growth the government is trying out ways to create a more compact and connected city via inexpensive public transportation denser housing and employment hubs.  The ethos of the C40 group emphasizes working with communities to ensure equitable and sustainable development: C40 mayors will lead in taking action for jobs and an inclusive economy by: C40 mayors will continue to take the lead in acting for resilience and equity providing fundamental public services for all that underpin a fair society and strong economy and that are resilient to future shocks by: C40 mayors will lead in taking action for health and well-being – giving public space back to people and nature reclaiming our streets and guaranteeing clean air to ensure liveable local communities by: C40 mayors alongside a global coalition of businesses civil society organisations climate activists and residents are already building a green and just recovery. Their agenda calls on national and regional governments central banks and international financial institutions to join them by: It all sounds good and I appreciate the devotion expertise and optimism Miller sets forth in Solved. But it’s definitely sometimes tough to share that optimism. Here in Arizona our former home in Sedona has been choked by wildfire smoke for over a week and in a preliminary prep stage for evacuation from the Rafael Fire. Just weeks ago the nearby town of Cornville was threatened by a wildfire. Phoenix has been experiencing record-breaking heat. The multi-year drought in the Southwest continues and Lake Mead is at extremely low levels. There’s so much that needs to be done and so little time.
