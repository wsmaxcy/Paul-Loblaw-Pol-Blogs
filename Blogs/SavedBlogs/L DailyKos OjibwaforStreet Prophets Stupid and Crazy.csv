L, Stupid and Crazy, OjibwaforStreet Prophets, 2021-05-04, Welcome to the Street Prophets Coffee Hour cleverly hidden at the intersection of religion and politics. This is an open thread where we can share our thoughts and comments about the day. Here on Daily Kos we sometimes see Republicans described as stupid and/or crazy. Let’s look at the etymologies of these two words. The word stupid came into English in the 1540s with the meaning of “mentally slow lacking ordinary activity of mind dull inane.” The etymology of stupid traces its origins to the Middle French stupide which came directly from the Latin stupidus meaning “amazed confounded dull foolish” which is from the verb stupere meaning “be stunned amazed confounded.” Going back farther in time stupid appears to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European *stupe- meaning “hit” which is from the root *(s)teu- meaning “to push stick knock beat.” The use of stupid to mean “lack of intelligence” evolved later as a secondary meaning. The word crazy entered into English in the 1570s with the meaning of “diseased sickly” and a decade later it had acquired the meaning of “broken impaired full of cracks.” Later it acquired a meaning of being “deranged demented and of unsound mind.” Crazy was formed from the verb craze which had come into English in the late 14th century as crasen or craisen which had the meaning of “to shatter crush break into pieces.” Some sources indicate that craze was originally a German word perhaps from the Old Norse verb *krasa meaning “to shatter.” While it may have an Old Norse origin it appears to have come into English from the Old French crasir which stems from the Old Norse. This is an open thread—all topics are welcome. It might be fun to nominate the politician you feel best illustrates each of these words.
