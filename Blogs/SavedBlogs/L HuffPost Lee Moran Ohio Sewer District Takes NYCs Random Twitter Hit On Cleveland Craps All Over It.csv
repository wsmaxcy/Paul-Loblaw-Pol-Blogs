L, Ohio Sewer District Takes NYC's Random Twitter Hit On Cleveland Craps All Over It, Lee Moran, 2021-07-03, Whoever was running the official New York City government Twitter feed on Friday began the Fourth of July weekend in an unusual way by taking a seemingly out-of-nowhere shot at Cleveland. “A gloomy day in New York City is still better than a sunny day in Cleveland” the government’s official account wrote alongside an image of the Big Apple’s iconic skyline.

Some commenters speculated it was in response to the billboards that appeared in New York in March urging businesses to relocate to Ohio. But the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District which operates in Cleveland didn’t take the tweet sitting down. “Doesn’t NYC have a sewer utility for this kind of crap” the district fired back later lightheartedly requesting to “file a report” with New York City Environmental Protection. doesn’t NYC have a sewer utility for this kind of crap https://t.co/piprdFzC9Q @NYCWater i’d like to file a report Others chimed in too: Figure out how to count your election results then get back to me https://t.co/0MpBfEULSW NYC woke up today and chose violence https://t.co/NGJlOM6rhA DeBlasio’s intern really going for it as the clock ticks down https://t.co/RFPftoo5kU Guess what state a lot of that steel is from? https://t.co/k4tXlq1gRq same energy https://t.co/eJlxDKoTef pic.twitter.com/MTp1UXFZ8N Do not kick Cleveland. https://t.co/30Cymp5T6w pic.twitter.com/GfUdqKk4wX DeBlasio really firing off everything in his drafts before he leaves office https://t.co/rBp4bciVsX Wait why is this happening lol https://t.co/uLjwMqD5LL Tell me your city is insecure without telling me your city is insecure. https://t.co/GuV3Rz79Ij I love @nycgov..but this is meaner than a rat stealing pizza on the subway! https://t.co/ICdj3UFBTj If I worked for the Cleveland tourist bureau I would see this tweet as a huge win. New York City has announced they see The Cleve as a rival. https://t.co/6kNGdZBeiM i’d argue the NYC government should invest more in fact-checking election results than throwing shade https://t.co/gsJUTnGpaQ failed states always turn to nationalism. https://t.co/J3pjE3T9oG Get some new material or someone better to run that account. https://t.co/Vvf1sXaXd9 pic.twitter.com/Z82vELK87D
