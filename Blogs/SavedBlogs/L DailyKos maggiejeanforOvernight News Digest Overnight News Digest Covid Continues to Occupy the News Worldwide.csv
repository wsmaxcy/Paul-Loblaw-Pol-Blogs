The Guardian The EU will reopen to holidaymakers from countries with low Covid infection rates such as the UK and to anyone who has been fully vaccinated by the start of June under a European Commission plan.

EU borders would be reopened by the start of June at the latest the officials said with agreement due to be sought from member states this month. The requirement to undergo Covid testing before or after arrival or to quarantine could still be enforced by individual states but an official said: “Hopefully with the situation improving and the vaccination rate immensely picking up we will also see a gradual phasing out of these additional conditions.” C/NET Intel on Monday announced a $3.5 billion upgrade to a chip manufacturing plant in Rio Rancho New Mexico that will boost a processor stacking technology called Foveros.

Al Jazeera US President Joe Biden is pushing to reinstate Iran’s nuclear deal and weeks of talks in Austria appear to be bearing fruit. Israel however continues to see its security jeopardised by a potentially nuclear Iran and is trying to thwart negotiations any way possible. The Mossad spy agency chief Yossi Cohen – a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – met Biden on Friday and according to one media report pressed the US president not to sign back on to the nuclear accord unless “improvements” were made. An unnamed senior Israeli official is quoted as saying Biden responded that the United States “is not close” to returning to the Iran deal Axios reported. Israel’s opposition to the nuclear agreement seems to go beyond words however with Iran accusing it of assassinating its top nuclear scientist and sabotaging its main nuclear facility Natanz in a series of attacks. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.

The Rev. Al Sharpton gave his second eulogy in two weeks for a Black man killed by law enforcement pressing officials to release body camera footage and painting the ongoing outcry over policing as the latest chapter of the civil rights movement in America.

It's a statistic that may surprise many: Just one year ago child COVID-19 cases made up only around 3% of the U.S. total. On Monday the AAP said children represented 22.4% of new cases reported in the past week accounting for 71649 out of 319601 cases. The latest report drawn from data collected through April 29 illustrates how children's share of coronavirus infections has grown in recent weeks. Experts link the trend to several factors – particularly high vaccination rates among older Americans. The U.S. recently announced 100 million people were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But other dynamics are also in play from new COVID-19 variants to the loosening of restrictions on school activities.

New York Times The Food and Drug Administration is preparing to authorize use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine in adolescents 12 to 15 years old by early next week according to federal officials familiar with the agency’s plans opening up the U.S. vaccination campaign to millions more people. Some parents have been counting down the weeks since Pfizer announced results from its trial in adolescents showing that the vaccine is at least as effective in that age group as it is in adults. Vaccinating children is key to raising the level of immunity in the population and bringing down the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. The clearance in the form of an amendment to the existing emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine could come as early as late this week. If it is granted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory panel is likely to meet the following day to review the clinical trial data and make recommendations for the vaccine’s use in adolescents. Washington Post Rep. Liz Cheney made clear Monday that she will continue to publicly denounce former president Donald Trump over his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen imperiling her position in House Republican leadership as GOP members continue to rally around Trump.

But Cheney (R-Wyo.) brushed aside those warnings Monday after Trump issued a statement attempting to commandeer the term “Big Lie” commonly used to refer to the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him by asserting that the term should now refer to President Biden’s election victory.
