L, Thorstein Veblen: Prophet of Social Doom, cprof, 2021-07-06,                              Thorstein Veblen: Prophet of Social Doom                                              By   Aaron P Donsky    Thorstein Veblen was a social/economist doing most of his writing during the first quarter of the 20th century and like   his contemporary John Maynard Keynes was less concerned with how economies achieve equilibrium and more with the forces of change.  But his work was and still is convoluted and difficult to read. He generally remembered for his phrases like “conspicuous consumption” in discussing the habits of the social elite ( Theory of the Leisure Class chapt. 6)  He was also a prophet who envisioned modern society involving into a growing struggle between increasing numbers of international corporations and the technology these organizations needed to prosper. He saw neither of them having much concern for the ordinary consumer.  This paper addresses this issue and its  relevance to the 21st century                                                                                                                                                                               The Essence of Veblen’s Thought On The Inherent Problem of The               Business Enterprise Technology and Civilized Society When Veblen wrote in the early 20th century he concluded that the struggle for societies in both free enterprise and socialist countries was not fundamentally political economic or militaristic but for both would be between those who invested in the corporate means of production (goods and services) and those who maintained the mechanical (now digital) mechanisms that made things work. He put it in the following way: When the question is cast up as to what will come of this conflict of institutional forces-called the Social Problem-it is commonly made a question of remedies. What can be done to save civilized society----two antagonistic factors may prove the stronger in the long run is something of a blind guess but the calculable future seems to belong to the one or the other. {Theory of the Business Enterprise  (Chapt 4) The machine process( now digital) gives no insight into questions of good and evil merit and demerit except in point of material causation nor into the foundations or constraining force of law and order (Theory of the Business Enterprise Chapt 4)  The two Classes (controllers of means of production- corporate Business) and those that operate the mechanical-(digital mechanisms) have an increasing difficulty in understanding one another… (Theory of the Business Enterprise Chapt 5} The Thinking required by the pecuniary occupations {who control the corporate means of production) proceeds on grounds of conventionality whereas that involved in the industrial occupations (mechanical/digital) in the main (on cause and effect) (Theory of the Business Enterprise Chapt 5)  The Fundamental Issue for Civil Society in the 21st century Using Veblen’s logic the survival of modern industrial society is not a matter of political militaristic or economic factors i.e. will not rest on which society will achieve more political approval from its constituents or provide more/better goods/services or have the strongest military machine.  He saw these issues as a reflection of a more fundamental social problem—the increasing thought difference between those that run the business enterprise (which are corporate investors) and those who operate the fundamental processes of enterprises for the corporate investors the digital technologists. Specifically Veblen tells us -Neither group understands the thinking processes of the other -Neither group is primarily concerned with needs or welfare of the larger population. The corporate investors relate their priorities to maximizing return on investment and the digital technologists to maximizing machine efficiency. -The corporate investors are largely conservative in their thinking relying primarily on what has worked in the past while the technologists are driven by change. -The irony is that each increasing needs the other to function effectively. Digital technology depends on innovation and innovation requires increased investment. -Political military and economic issues can be viewed as a reflection of the inability to resolve the deep social problem between these two groups leading to social conflict while the real fundamental problem (the thinking processes of each) goes unresolved.  Reflections of the Unresolved Social Problem in Contemporary Society The inability to resolve this Social Problem has consequences for us all. -Technological advances in complexity and applications to human life have come at the expense of loss of individual privacy with little concern for the needs of the consumer. -International corporations grow in number and investor wealth with little to no major improvement in poverty and health conditions through much of the world. -Nations fundamentally attempt to resolve political and economic issues related to corporate and or technological action on a national level when both corporate and technological issues are increasingly occurring on an international stage. -Attempts at resolving differences between investors and technologists in the political economic or military arena produce no lasting results. -In the case of both international corporate investors and technologists nations call for them to exercise self-regulation which is futile given the thought processes and fundamental goals of each of the two groups.  A Direction for Possible Resolution of the Social Problem Veblen could not see an easy resolution particularly in a world populated by nation-states. The digital nature of technology has begun a continuing movement to globalization which provides a direction not easily seen in the early 20th century. Globalization itself provides the possibility of a new stage for examining the importance of consumer interests beyond those of corporate investors and technologists. -All corporate policies including investments and priorities could be regulated on a global level when they have international impact. The regulation could be done by an International body such as a revised United Nation where every nation has equal influence. -Technological development which impacts corporate business practices that affect the lives of consumers could be made to conform to international guidelines developed by the same international body regulating global corporations.
