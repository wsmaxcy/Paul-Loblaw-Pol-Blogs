L, RAGING BULLSH!T: Tucker Carlson Hosts Candace Owens's Rancid Post-Verdict Rant on Fox News, News Corpse, 2021-04-21, On Tuesday night Fox News presented another episode of Tucker Carlson's White Power Hour. The program featured Carlson's regularly scheduled incendiary and racist hostility along with guest Candace Owens who joined him to deliver a nauseating harangue on the guilty verdicts for George Floyd's killer Derek Chauvin. Throughout the interview Tucker nodded approvingly (though still maintaining his resting confused a-hole face). And through much of the segment he played stock footage of burning buildings from Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Why? Because Fox News wants their audience to think that there were civil disturbances happening currently in response to the verdicts. It's their way of inciting fear among their dimwitted and hateful viewers. Carlson began his interview by belittling the verdicts that he claimed were the result of viewing "a murder case through the lens of politics." "When you you get to that point" Carlson warned "haven't you already given up civilization?" That's a good question considering that it is Carlson who is forcing the case to be viewed through a political lens. And his idea of abandoning civilization is when his white supremacist authoritarianism is threatened. It's not the first time that Carlson has equated the loss of white power to the end of civilization. For her part Owens contributed another of her aberrant self-hating racial rants. It was a long painful soliloquy of deranged hate mongering that utterly dismissed the verdicts and the entire trial that the whole country watched (except for Fox News viewers because they chose not to air most it). Owens started off with a bizarre allegation of "mob justice" which she is falsely attributing to the media to citizens exercising their First Amendment rights and even to the jury itself (video below). Owens is lying about the video not being shown in context with other video. There were numerous videos from multiple perspectives including the body-cams worn by the police. She's also dismissing the testimony of the eyewitnesses and the medical experts. She's even dismissing the testimony of the police officers including the Chief of Police Chauvin's boss. But she wasn't through. She still had to malign Floyd personally and assassinate Floyd's character: Now Owens is lying about the fentanyl. A toxicologist at the trial testified that the fentanyl in Floyd's system was not enough to be fatal. He told the court that "Mr. Floyd died from a low level of oxygen and this caused damage to his brain." But Owens still wasn't through. She went on to make some ludicrous charges about the motives of the media and Democrats: It is peak audacity for Owens to blame Democrats for inciting riots (which they never did) after she defended the Trump Insurrectionists that attacked the Capitol on January 6th. They literally sent "soldiers" (armed Oath Keepers and Proud Boys) to assault and even murder members of Congress as they endeavored to carry out their constitutional duties. Owens closes by falsely claiming that Democrats are "celebrating" the Chauvin verdicts. Virtually every prominent Democrat who has commented publicly has said that this is not a celebratory moment. It is a solemn occasion that must remain focused on the lives lost. And it is just the beginning of a struggle for equity and justice. And for Owens to baselessly charge that the trial wasn't fair is - like Trump's "Big Lie" about election fraud - a purposeful call to arms for more of the violence that produced the deadly Capitol riots.
