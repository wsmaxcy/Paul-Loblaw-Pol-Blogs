L, List of U.S. Congress incumbents who are not running for re-election in 2022-Ballotpedia, mjbos, 2021-07-06, Most voters don’t pay attention to elections this far in advance but maybe that needs to change. As of July ‘21 18 members of Congress have announced they will not seek re-election. 10 members are retiring: five Senators all Republican are retiring. In House three Democrats and two Republicans are retiring. Eight House members are running for other offices three Republican's two Democrats.  Net impact on House is five seats on each side of aisle will be open. In Senate Senate seats in PA NC OH MS AL will be open due to retirement. Democrats will have a shot in three: PA NC OH. Demings will give Rubio a run in FL. Grassely’s constituents want him to go away so Johnson in WI has not announced one way or another however his approval rating is just 35%. Domestic terrorist who occupied the WH is doing his damnedest to screw Lisa Murkowski in AK. I count 6 Senate seats that Democrats have a shot at even if some of them are not great today. We have over 16 months until midterm election plenty of time to jack up the effort to turn all 6. These additional seats gets us to 56 which would make Manchin and Sinema irrelevant. ballotpedia.org/...
