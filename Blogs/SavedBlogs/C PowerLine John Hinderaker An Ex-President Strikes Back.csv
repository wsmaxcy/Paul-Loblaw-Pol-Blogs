C, An Ex-President Strikes Back, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-29, President Trump has had it with taking shots from Dr. Fraudci and most recently Deborah Birx. Today he sent out this email telling his side of the story. Quotable quote: “…Dr. Fauci who said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate…” Based on their interviews I felt it was time to speak up about Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations which I fortunately almost always overturned. They had bad policy decisions that would have left our country open to China and others closed to reopening our economy and years away from an approved vaccine—putting millions of lives at risk. We developed American vaccines by an American President in record time nine months which is saving the entire world. We bought billions of dollars of these vaccines on a calculated bet that they would work perhaps the most important bet in the history of the world. Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx moved far too slowly and if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression. Families and children in particular would be suffering the mental strains of this disaster like never before.  In a fake interview last night on CNN Dr. Fauci who said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate it was a “roller” tried to take credit for the vaccine when in fact he said it would take three to five years and probably longer to have it approved. Dr. Fauci was incapable of pressing the FDA to move it through faster. I was the one to get it done and even the fake news media knows and reports this. Dr. Fauci is also the king of “flip-flops” and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible. He fought me so hard because he wanted to keep our country open to countries like China. I closed it against his strong recommendation which saved many lives. Dr. Fauci also said we didn’t need to wear masks then a few months later he said we needed to wear masks and now two or three of them. Fauci spent U.S. money on the Wuhan lab in China—and we now know how that worked out.  Dr. Birx is a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as “pseudo-science” and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and in fact would ask not to be in the same room with her. The States who followed her lead like California had worse outcomes on Covid and ruined the lives of countless children because they couldn’t go to school ruined many businesses and an untold number of Americans who were killed by the lockdowns themselves. Dr. Birx was a terrible medical advisor which is why I seldom followed her advice. Her motto should be “Do as I say not as I do.” Who can forget when Dr. Birx gave a huge mandate to the people of our Nation to not travel and then traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving—only to have them call the police and turn her in? She then embarrassingly for her resigned.  Finally Dr. Birx says she can’t hear very well but I can. There was no “very difficult” phone call other than Dr. Birx’s policies that would have led us directly into a COVID caused depression. She was a very negative voice who didn’t have the right answers. Time has proven me correct. I only kept Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx on because they worked for the U.S. government for so long—they are like a bad habit! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
