Beijing is engaged in multiple efforts to cultivate its local semiconductor talent but knows that the fastest way to achieve self reliance in the technology is to poach talent from Taiwan – where the engineers not only speak the same language they have experience working in the world’s most advanced chip fabs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) the world’s largest contract chip maker has borne the brunt of that poaching and it seems that the company’s founder 89-year-old Morris Chang who retired nearly three years ago has had enough “I call on the [Taiwan] government society and TSMC to keep hold of it tightly” he added. 📙✒📒 UK-Bangladesh: UK government and general direction in recent times given the Brexit fiasco a sober look at the state is UK government and a rough evaluation at Dhaka Tribune an op-ed by Nizam Alam that starkly states OP-ED: Fool Britannia Does the UK have its priorities straight? Global Britain is one of Boris Johnson’s favourite catchphrases. Theresa May used it first in 2016 to declare the UK is not going to become inward looking after Brexit and under Johnson the phrase has become ever more prominent. Do not fret about losing freedom of movement among the EU27 the mantra proclaims look instead at the freedom the UK will gain to deal with other faster growing parts of the global economy. (Even if evidence for any freedom gained remains scarce on the ground.) 2021 is the year it all comes good according to Johnson. The UK has done relatively well in making procuring and delivering vaccines. Only naysayers will bother to mention the UK had the biggest GDP drop among G7 nations last year as well as 150000 Covid deaths. 📚✒📙📒 Myanmar-ASEAN: After the ASEAN special summit to discuss Myanmar coup and military attrocities over at The Diplomat an evaluation of what exactly was achieved at the summit. Assessing the Outcome of ASEAN’s Special Meeting on Myanmar On Saturday the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held its much-anticipated emergency summit to address the ongoing crisis in Myanmar. In the three months since the military seized power and deposed the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi the country has ground to a halt amid nationwide protests and escalating violence by the security forces which have claimed the lives of at least 753 people according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). The junta has also throttled communications cutting off internet every night for more than two months and banning mobile internet and public wifi connections. At the end of Saturday’s meeting leaders from the 10 ASEAN member states including Myanmar’s junta leader Sen. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing established five points of consensus about the Myanmar crisis. First that there should be “an immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar”; second that the parties in Myanmar should seek a peaceful solution to the crisis via “constructive dialogue”; third that Brunei this year’s ASEAN Chair will appoint a special envoy to mediate in the Myanmar crisis; fourth that ASEAN will provide humanitarian assistance to the country; and fifth that the special envoy will travel to Myanmar to meet with all parties in the crisis. 📚✒📙📒 Vietnam: With the power struggle between various powers over at Modern Diplomacy a look at Middle Power Conundrum: The Case of a Rising Vietnam The Indo-Pacific is a dynamic concept that has come into the picture of great power politics. In the last two decades an Indo-Pacific identity is increasingly becoming synonymous to a single maritime construct. Countries in the region are driven by geo-economic and geo-political interests with a constant presence of external payers. Due to its strategic relevance China is pushing forwards its expansionist agenda by striking a historical chord and threatening interests of smaller states in the region. Vietnam has been one of the victims as well as the one to stand up against China’s advances. According to realist theory in international relations scholarship a country can be categorized as a middle power depending upon a state’s military strength economic capabilities and geostrategic position. Due to the power gap diplomacy as a foreign policy tool is used often to participate in international politics and exert influence among regional players. Vietnam has taken charge of ASEAN Chairmanship three times since its entry and been part of significant regional building mechanisms to strengthen its commitment towards three pillars of ASEAN community. Its strategic location growing economic and military strength makes Vietnam an important player in the region. This article makes a case for Vietnam as a rising middle power in the region that has the potential to play a prominent role in Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of its growing economy interpersonal relations leadership role in ASEAN and regional security order amidst escalating Chinese threat. Leading the ASEAN Economy In the aftermath of Doi Moi reforms Vietnam focused on the development of a multi-sector economy. In 1989 it exported rice for the first time and today is the 4th largest rice exporter in the world. In the aftermath of Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 the country registered a strong 8.5% GDP growth rate. In 2008 it was removed from the world’s least developed countries (LDCs) and since then has been registering a consistent growth rate above 5%. 📚✒📙📒 Trinidad&Tobago: Over at Global Voices an example of issues facing what used to be tourist hotspot beach destinations Could the sargassum plaguing Tobago's beaches be an opportunity? Several beaches in Tobago have once again been rendered unrecognisable by large clusters of sargassum seaweed washing ashore. The issue was recently highlighted by researchers from Trinidad and Tobago's Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) who were in Tobago to conduct monitoring work. The IMA advised via its social media pages that its team had “noticed a significant amount of sargassum” washing up on the shores of Little Rockly Bay located along the island's Atlantic coast where the impact of the brown macro-algae is most acutely felt. As the sargassum issue has continued to evolve into a seasonal crisis for many Caribbean islands dependent on tourism people have begun asking questions about the origin of the phenomenon: Why it is happening? Is it possible to stop it? Can sargassum seaweed be put to good use? The answers may surprise you. 📚✒📙📒 South America: Over at Eurasia Review a longish analytical read What Comes After Commodity Super Cycle And Pandemic? Policies To Tackle Poverty And Inequality In Latin America – Analysis  Latin America entered the pandemic as one of the most unequal regions in the world. And like much of the rest of the world it will come out of the pandemic poorer and more unequal. Early estimates suggest that 19 million more people in the region have fallen into poverty and inequality increased by 5 percent compared to pre-crisis levels. Large scale public support in many countries prevented an even worse outcome but this pushed public debt levels from 68 to 77 percent of GDP. This will likely limit governments’ ability to tackle longer-term legacies of the pandemic once the recovery gains traction. And yet the outlook for poverty and inequality in the region could be brighter than it appears for two reasons: (i) resurgent commodity prices; and (ii) the opportunity provided by the pandemic for a broader political and social consensus on necessary reforms.
