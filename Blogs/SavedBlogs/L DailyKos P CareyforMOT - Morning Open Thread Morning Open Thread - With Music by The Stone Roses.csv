Good morning everyone and welcome to Friday’s Morning Open Thread—which if you’re reading this means you’ve made it through another week. The day seems to be starting out well here. No rain until about noon and the highs are going to hover just above the mid-80s. For the second time this year I needed to add a couple pounds of Freon to my air conditioning system Wednesday which is unusual; there is a tiny leak somewhere I haven’t yet found (despite multiple efforts) but usually I need to supplement it once every other year. This is what the unusually hot days do when they stack back-to-back-to-back as they’ve been prone to do since May. The rainfall—the shear amount of water we’ve taken on this year alone—is staggering even for a place like the semi-tropical wetlands where I live.  But this short note isn’t about the weather but about what the weather produces. Ice cream. My sister last Sunday called to tell me she was feeling well enough to get out the house and her husband and son were coming to town to get ice cream at a shop in our old downtown that dates to when we were in our early teens. Suffering from chemo brain she forgot my son was in Vegas with his maternal grandparents and invited us to meet them there. I reminded her he was out of town but jumped at the chance to visit Scarlet Scoop and told them I’d meet them there (I was driving in from Kenner near New Orleans) after responding to an emergency call from a regional office of our State Troopers (which had lost all air conditioning following a bad storm).   She and I both got a scoop of spumoni—this place has it’s own recipe—while her son got a scoop of vanilla and my brother in law ordered pralines and cream. A stick of saltwater taffy for my nephew completed the order and we sat at the cafe table and laughed about feeling 13 again. Like so many families when I was growing up the ice cream we had during the summers was homemade on a crank machine so store-bought and exotic flavors were special somehow. She reminded me of the small cups of vanilla we used to get at the summer Catholic fairs. Those single servings came in a waxed paper cup with a tabbed paper top and a flat small oddly-shaped wooden “spoon.” I remember them costing a dime or maybe that is just economic nostalgia. But in any event they were singular treats that she and I both remembered. Particularly the spoon. I can still remember the exact taste of that cheap wood in my mouth (a hint of balsa) the feel of its slightly-rough surface against my tongue and the edges of the handle against my fingers. The utter uselessness of that utensil overall struck us both; it was an awful way to get the ice cream (all of it at least) out the cup and its flatness made each attempted bite just a bit precarious. Still I remember the spoon much more than the ice cream and so did she.  What I realized while we later walked around downtown was that memory of the spoon was a shared one between us and—as it turns out—between plenty of people. I mentioned it to my love a few days later and she laughed and told me her own story of the spoon as have several of my friends when I’ve asked them if they recall those devices: not just the feel and taste but the way they could be slightly curved when you soaked them in your mouth after they had served their purpose how you could methodically split them and use the resulting splinters as toothpicks or just nest them vertically between your teeth and cheek to savor the memory of a cool dollop of fake vanilla-infused ice cream. As near a universal memory around here as I’m going to find. Cheers all and to have lovely day. We’re coming up to a holiday weekend and I for one and looking forward to a three-day weekend.  ❧      ❧ ☕️ Grab your coffee or tea and join us please. What's on your mind this morning?
