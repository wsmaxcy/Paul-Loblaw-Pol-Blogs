L, Kevin McCarthy’s Hot Take On Joe Biden’s Speech To Congress Goes Awry, Lee Moran, 2021-04-29, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) drew scorn on Twitter Wednesday night for his dismissive response to President Joe Biden’s first speech to a joint session of Congress. Biden highlighted his administration’s accomplishments and laid out his goals to transform the American economy in the 65-minute address. He also said he was open to working with Republicans. But McCarthy a Donald Trump sycophant glibly tweeted: This whole thing could have just been an email. Later on Fox News McCarthy repeated the now-debunked falsehood that Biden’s climate plan seeks to limit the amount of red meat that Americans can eat. “It just continues he wants control of your life” McCarthy told prime-time personality Sean Hannity. “He’s going to control how much meat you can eat. Can you imagine that?” Watch the video here: Kevin McCarthy invokes the lie that Biden wants to ban hamburgers pic.twitter.com/ZCbfnJLczj Critics called out McCarthy for his tweet and the tossing of literal red meat to the GOP base: Shhhhh.
