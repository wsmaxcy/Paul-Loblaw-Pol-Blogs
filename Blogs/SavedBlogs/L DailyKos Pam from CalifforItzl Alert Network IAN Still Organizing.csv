L, IAN: Still Organizing, Pam from CalifforItzl Alert Network, 2021-06-29,         Monday: Crimson Quillfeather alternating with ZenTrainer Tuesday: ejoanna Wednesday: Pam from Calif Thursday: art ah zen Friday: FloridaSNMOM Saturday: FloridaSNDad Sunday: loggersbrat Still supervising and offering opinions. When finances allow the carpet will be gone. Hardwood will be beautiful instead of dingy carpets.  The estate/yard/garage sale was successful. People were happy to shop and buy my items. Less clutter earned some $ and the car will soon be parked in the garage. The day of the sale had 95F temps. Maci found a way to play with her favorite shoelace/toy and remain cool.  Supervising a slow human is very taxing. Time for a well earned nap.
