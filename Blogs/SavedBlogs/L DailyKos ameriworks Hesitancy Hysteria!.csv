L, Hesitancy Hysteria!, ameriworks, 2021-04-26, Someone in our government needs to run down the numbers to those fools who are refusing to get COVID vaccinated endangering not only themselves but everyone they come in contact with.  The hysteria about the J&J blood clotting issue is absurd and sure isn’t cause for anyone to not get the J&J shot. Because of this stupidity some folks are now deciding not to get their second Pfizer and Moderna shots for fear of ….???  How dumb is that?  Do we want to end this nightmare or not? Here’s the numbers.  All are as of last week.  It was reported that 15 women had clotting issues and 3  died after getting J&J vaccinations out of approximately 8000000 people who have been vaccinated with the J&J vaccine.  It’s questionable whether or not the vaccine caused the blood clotting and deaths.  Be that as it may just 1 out of 533333 people had clotting issues and only 1 out of 2666667 have died.  I’ll take those odds any day! The U. S. population is roughly 331420000.  There have been 32071760 COVID cases in America or about 1 out of every 10 people.  There have been 572174 deaths from COVID so roughly 1 out of 56 people who contracted COVID died. What all this boils down to is that the chances of getting COVID and dying from it are far far greater than getting blood clots from the J&J vaccine and dying from it.  How much greater you ask? A person is 51630 times more likely to get COVID without the J&J shot then get a blood clot with it!  Also the likelihood of dying from the J&J shot is 4606 times less than dying from COVID! Considering that 1.78% of those who got COVID died from it and only .000038% of those who have gotten the J&J shot died from it what’s the big deal?  Come on Americans put on your big boy and big girl pants and get vaccinated.  It’s your patriotic duty.  Stop wimping out and acting like spoiled brats!
