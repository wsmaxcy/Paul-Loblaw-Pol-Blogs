L, Rep. Paul Gosar Demands To Know Who 'Executed' Ashli Babbitt, Ed Scarce, 2021-06-16, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Gosar had described Babbitt as a patriot "wrapped in the American flag" before she was mercilessly gunned down by a law enforcement officer for trying to break into part of the Capitol building. It's just jaw-dropping to me that any elected Representative would characterize the death of a rioter in this fashion. That Gosar remains in Congress and not under arrest for his role in the riot and with the rioters shames us all.  Liz Cheney called Gosar's remarks "disgusting and despicable." Source: Washington Post In a hearing on Tuesday Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) abruptly turned his questions for FBI Director Christopher A. Wray toward the Capitol police officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt an Air Force veteran who tried to leap through a window during the Jan. 6 insurrection. Gosar demanded to know why the FBI hasn’t disclosed the name of the officer who was cleared of wrongdoing by prosecutors in April. “It’s disturbing” Gosar told Wray while claiming that Babbitt was “executed.” “The Capitol police officer that did that shooting appeared to be hiding lying in wait and then gave no warning before killing her.” Politico's Josh Gerstein spotlighted Gosar's comments which he repeated to others besides FBI director Wray. An investigation by D.C. Police and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C. found that the officer’s actions did not warrant prosecution. — Josh Gerstein (@joshgerstein) June 15 2021 Liz Cheney called Gosar's comments "disgusting and despicable" which is one reason she's not in Republican "leadership"[sic] any longer. On January 6 as the violent mob advanced on the House chamber I was standing near @RepGosar and helped him open his gas mask. The Capitol Police led us to safety. It is disgusting and despicable to see Gosar lie about that day and smear the men and women who defended us. https://t.co/GKsnekHBKx — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) June 16 2021 Rep. Adam Kinzinger called Gosar "sick." You’re sick Paul sadly. Truth is Ashli was manipulated by people like you and breached an area and put lives in danger despite being repeatedly warned not to. The real criminals are the liars abusing people for political power. https://t.co/II87W8J6DD — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) June 16 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
