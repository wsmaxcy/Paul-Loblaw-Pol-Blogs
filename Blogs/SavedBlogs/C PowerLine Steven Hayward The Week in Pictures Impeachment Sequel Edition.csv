C, The Week in Pictures: Impeachment Sequel Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-02-13, Is it merely a coincidence that the Annual Trump Impeachment nearly coincided with Groundhog Day? This really is becoming as regular and tedious as Tom Brady in the Super Bowl. What’s that? Oh. Well at least he’s a Trump supporter which makes sense doesn’t it? Doesn’t everyone who has a supermodel trophy wife support Trump? I think I read that in Trophy Wife Aficionado magazine. (Or is that “MAGA-zine”?)                                               The only thing missing is Barney the dinosaur. Headlines of the week:                      Rare photo of Keith Richards holding Betty White                            And finally. . .  since Disney cancelled Gina Carano this week:   Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
