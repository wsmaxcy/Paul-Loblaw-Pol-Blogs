L, Climate Crisis: Mining the Sky for Carbon, boatsie, 2021-07-06, Scientists have served notice that planting trees may not be an effective way to store carbon to slow down the acceleration of climate change and global warming.  It takes at least ten years for the trees to begin storing CO2 and 100 years for forests to become effective for carbon sequestration. Regenerated soil is a better alternative capable of storing carbon for hundreds of years;  algae hemp and bamboo are other natural sources for carbon storage.( www.dezeen.com/...) The big guns in the carbon revolution however are carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU). CCS removes carbon from the air and stores it underground; CCU removes and utilizes carbon. Companies like Switzerland’s Climeworks believe the end game is not to stop but to reverse climate change. The major threat from increased CO2 is the greenhouse effect. As a greenhouse gas excessive CO2 creates a cover that traps the sun's heat energy in the atmospheric bubble warming the planet and the oceans. An increase in CO2 plays havoc with the Earth's climates by causing changes in weather patterns sciencing.com/... The first CCU facility was opened in Switzerland by Climeworks in 2017. The company sucks the carbon from the air and then sells it for use in fertilizers synthetic fuels and sparkling drinks. "We capture CO2 from the atmosphere" said Christoph Beuttler head of climate policy at the Swiss company. "We're mining the sky because there's too much carbon in it. And it's a sustainable resource.” Climeworks currently operates 14 CCUs and believes the growth of its company can play a significant role in addressing global warming. Atmospheric carbon can be used to make cement. Construction and the ‘built environment’ emit approximately 40% of global emissions with cement itself emitting almost 8% of atmospheric carbon.   Beuttler proposes a carbon negative synthetic cement made from carbon suggesting that buldings from recycled cement would store carbon for quite a long time. Experts say to reverse climate change we would need to remove 33 gigatons of existing GHGs this year and every year moving forward.(www.livescience.com/...)  "Carbon is the most valuable resource in our society" Beuttler explained. "We have built our society on carbon. The problem is that it's coming out of the ground and it adds additional carbon to the atmosphere." "So we capture CO2 from the atmosphere to do two things" he added. "To store it away permanently to achieve negative emissions and to make products from CO2 so you can replace fossil CO2." "You can build polymers you can build oils; anything you can get from oil and gas you can build with that process." www.dezeen.com/...  "You have a way of building materials from the sky rather than from the ground" said Beuttler. "And that's the idea behind this carbon revolution."   "Carbon is very special" Carbon is the most important and versatile element on Earth according to carbon nanomaterials professor Andrei Khlobystov. "Carbon is very special" Khlobystov told Dezeen. "All life on Earth is based on carbon." Khlobystov believes that science is well on its way to developing viable ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere and turning it into useful products. "If you take carbon dioxide remove oxygen atoms and add some hydrogen atoms we can make liquid fuels that we can use to drive cars" he said. "You can also turn it into polymers" he said. "You can make chemicals. We can make ethanol out of carbon dioxide and then use it to make vodka for example." www.dezeen.com/…
