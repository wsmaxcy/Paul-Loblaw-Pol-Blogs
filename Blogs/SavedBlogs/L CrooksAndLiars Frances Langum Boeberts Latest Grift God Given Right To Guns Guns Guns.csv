L, Boebert's Latest Grift: 'God Given' Right To Guns Guns Guns, Frances Langum, 04-27-21, As many of you know I have a master's degree in theological studies.  But Divinity School never taught me about the particular combo of sins that is this Lauren Boebert tweet: Kamala Harris has just called for an assault weapons ban.Every single day these tyrants are coming for our God-given rights.It‚Äôs more important now than ever to stand up and say HELL NO!Pitch in today! We‚Äôre not letting them touch our guns! https://t.co/AzCr1Ff60q ‚Äî Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) April 25 2021 "Kamala Harris has just called for an assault weapons ban.  Every single day these tyrants are coming for our God-given rights.  It‚Äôs more important now than ever to stand up and say HELL NO!  Pitch in today! We‚Äôre not letting them touch our guns!" So there's false witness avarice dissing the sabbath (cuz fk she sent this "h e double-toothpicks" message on a Sunday) and graven imagery all in one. I think my confirmation classes skipped over that part of the Bible. Where exactly does God say owning guns is a right? ‚Äî Amy @ üè† (@amypurls) April 26 2021 Assault weapons? Are God-given rights?Honestly.  That is just nuts.I think God would much prefer not making it easy to take people out by the gross. ‚Äî Kathy NJ (@ecclesias) April 26 2021 Imagine believing "God" gave you gun rights... üòÜüòÖüòÇü§£ ‚Äî Angela Belcamino (@AngelaBelcamino) April 25 2021 28 instances of money grabs this month alone even on Sunday Boebert has her hand out ready to grift for her own personal use. ‚Äî Bumper McGee (@America41051637) April 25 2021 Oh look what time it is grift o‚Äôclock! ‚Äî Brittany (@britknee_00) April 25 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
