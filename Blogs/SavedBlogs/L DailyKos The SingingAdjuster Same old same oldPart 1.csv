L, Same old same oldPart 1, The SingingAdjuster, 2021-04-25, I started this post with Part 2 America 21st Century.  I didn’t mean to disparage Obama.  It was just a statement of when I wrote the song and things were happening beyond his control.  I truly believe he will go down as a great President. This is #1 “The America I Love Is Crying” written during the W. Bush years and aimed directly at that administration.  The way they stole the election bothered me as I know it bothered many others.  I grew up in a small town in upstate New York.  We had values we had our word and a code of ethics.  When the Bush team came in that was all lost on them.  I could go on ad nauseam about that administration  but the point where I cracked was when he addressed the “haves and have mores”.  From this point on they put it in our faces like no one had done before.  This has not stopped Anyway as a real small town American God and country Boy Scout and all I was extremely saddened.  Thus this song.  The America I Love Is Crying Link: johncannonmusic.com/music    The America I love is crying the America I love is crying From the Gulf unto both coasts East and West Through the Heartland to all towns big and small.  We put trust in our leaders to go out and do what’s right Make things better for the people of our land. But their actions are screaming drowning out the words they say And it’s clear they’re working on a different plan.  The America I love is crying the America I love is crying From the Gulf unto both coasts East and West Through the Heartland to all towns big and small.  Now we’re a war with people who had never done us harm all because of a misguided point of view. And the say don’t play the “blame game” every time something goes wrong Would they say that to us if THEY just got robbed?  The America I love is crying the America I love is crying From the Gulf unto both coasts East and West Through the Heartland to all towns big and small.  Now I see all these religions each one claims to be the best Do you really think that God would choose a side? I hear “no child left behind” well at least not ‘till they’re born And they keep us dumb to what is going on.  The America I love is crying the America I love is crying  Now we hear about voter fraud ‘cause even when you win you lose. Don’t you think it’s strange they can’t work that one out? And to vote against yourself is taken to a new ‘art form’ While the corporations write the rules of law  The America I love is crying the America I love is crying From the Gulf unto both coasts East and West Through the Heartland and all towns big and small.  Now they’re closing down the factories sending jobs overseas Dividing into red or blue secret prisons rights abused The White House lying on TV while the press corps lets them off ‘Scot free’ Do you buy your medicine or eat give tax breaks to the elite Issues I can’t even touch there’s way too many way too much Like the greedy war profiteers propaganda selling fear Mothers fathers shedding tears how the hell did we get here?  The America I love is crying
