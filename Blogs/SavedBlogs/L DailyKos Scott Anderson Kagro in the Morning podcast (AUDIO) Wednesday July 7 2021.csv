L, Kagro in the Morning podcast (AUDIO): Wednesday July 7 2021, Scott Anderson, 2021-07-07,  David Waldman and Greg Dworkin celebrate National Tell the Truth Day by delivering just a regular KITM: Haiti President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated forcing many Americans to learn more about Haiti and what has been going on there. Many others won’t bother when they can always pull something out of their butt. People just like lies. Mike Pompeo will tell you lies are much safer than the truth. Matt Walsh knows that the truth is in fact more dangerous than any gun. We all know that’s a lie… but on the other hand who knows what risk truth carries? It is the dianniversary of the insurrection to ratify the Big Lie as truth and the New Lost Cause is such a comfort to Republican candidates and voters that truth and democracy have become an existential threat. Donald Trump is just the Hitler conservatives need to hold onto what they have. Reporters who were at the Capitol still suffer from PTSD. Every Gop state party chairman will remain neutral unless they have a big lie to protect. Truth is sometimes so uncomfortable people would rather die than confront it. Unfortunately the truth is not everyone deserves to catch Covid. Old people understand the truth about the fragility of life and stay safe. Waves come and go but the more people who are safe the more people stay safe. Nikole Hannah-Jones won a Pulitzer prize for her work on the 1619 project. She was about to join the University of North Carolina as a tenured chair but UNC megadonor Walter Hussman threatened to take away his megadonations if Hannah-Jones got tenure so the University pulled the rug out from under her. So Nikole took her talents and $20 million or so and brought them over to Howard University. This is justice for Hannah-Jones but probably did little for any other Black professors out there. Still lessons were learned at the Tulane School of Medicine who are on probation by their accreditor over allegations of racism and lack of diversity.
