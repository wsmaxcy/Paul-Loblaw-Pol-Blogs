L, Virtual Fridays Without Fitzpatrick (VFWF) 13, SteveCickay, 2021-05-08, Virtual Fridays Without Fitzpatrick (VFWF) 13 In Response To Your 05/07/21 Newsletter  “The Puppy Protection Act As a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Animal Protection Caucus I’m committed to ensuring our government is doing its part to promote animal welfare….” What? Puppies again? Come on Congressman I love puppies too but I love democracy as well. And your Republican Party is still engaged in an all-out assault on our fragile system of government. I would therefore expect at least a few words concerning this incredibly existential threat to our political system to be written in your newsletter. But all we hear from you is puppy talk. This week Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis whose political goal in life is to be Trumpier than Trump signed voter suppression legislation exclusively on Fox “News” which constantly continues to feed its listeners the Big Lie that the former president won the election. Similar voter suppression bills are moving through Republican legislatures all across the country. The Arizona Republican legislators have commissioned a phony audit of the already certified and audited Arizona 2020 presidential race to somehow prove to the loser and his Big Lie-fed base that he did not lose the 2020 presidential election in Arizona. Republican leadership in the House is getting ready to remove Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership position for the sin of speaking the truth about the 2020 election; namely that there was no election fraud the former president indeed lost the race and those who support the Big Lie are attacking the foundation of our democracy. You spoke with Chuck Todd last week about the need for political courage in order to accomplish good things the American people need and will therefore remember you for. Congressman there is no political courage in talking about puppies. Everyone loves puppies. Congresswoman Liz Cheney a person I disagree with on almost every political policy issue has exhibited outstanding political courage by standing up to the former president and his Big Lie that has already caused an insurrection death and injury to Americans and continues to wreak havoc on our democracy. I respect her because she has the political courage to stand up publicly for the concept of our democracy within which we should have vigorous policy debates but not about plans and policies to undermine the very foundation of our democracy. She obviously puts love of our beloved democracy over the pursuit of personal power or allegiance to the current insane direction of her fact-free conspiracy-theory-laden Republican Party.  So where do you stand? Yes I know with puppies. But where do you stand on fighting for our democracy? I called your office this week to see if you had made a decision about whether to support keeping Liz Cheney's leadership role in the House. I was told you have no statement yet on this issue yet.  I guess since she is not a puppy you are having trouble deciding what to say. I guess you think her plight is not worth mentioning in your newsletter so you write about puppies. She only is standing up against the Big Lie that is still destroying our democracy. A minor issue I guess for Republicans who are still embracing the Big Lie to curry favor with the disgruntled loser lurking the halls of his country club in Florida. Meanwhile Putin smiles. You tell us about puppies but say nothing about the forces within your Party that aim to destroy our democracy. Where is your political courage? Maybe you can ask Congresswoman Liz Cheney to borrow some of hers for a day or so? I received this week the January 25th edition of the New Yorker delayed no doubt due to another failed strategy the former president planned to use to steal an election victory: the gutting of our Post Office (what are you doing to fix that?). In that issue was a reminder of what the January 6th insurrection was all about. I’ll quote a few paragraphs to remind you what the former president whom you failed to impeach twice and for whom you voted in 2020 did to attack our democracy that day.  Perhaps these facts will cause you to find your political courage so that you will stop talking about puppies and speak out against the dangerous road your Republican Party is taking that will if unchecked lead to the death of our democracy. Maybe you can also find the political courage to speak out against 140 of your own Republican political colleagues who in December also sought to overturn a fair secure democratic election. Now that would be something to remember. AMONG THE INSURRECTIONISTS By Luke Mogelson https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/among-the-insurrectionists “By the end of President Donald Trump’s crusade against American democracy—after a relentless deployment of propaganda demagoguery intimidation and fear mongering aimed at persuading as many Americans as possible to repudiate their country’s foundational principles—a single word sufficed to nudge his most fanatical supporters into open insurrection. Thousands of them had assembled on the Mall in Washington D.C. on the morning of January 6th to hear Trump address them from a stage outside the White House. From where I stood at the foot of the Washington Monument you had to strain to see his image on a jumbotron that had been set up on Constitution Avenue. His voice however projected clearly through powerful speakers as he rehashed the debunked allegations of massive fraud which he’d been propagating for months. Then he summarized the supposed crimes simply as “bulls**t.” “Bulls**t! Bulls**t!” the crowd chanted. It was a peculiar mixture of emotion that had become familiar at pro-Trump rallies since he lost the election: half mutinous rage half gleeful excitement at being licensed to act on it. The profanity signalled a final jettisoning of whatever residual deference to political norms had survived the past four years. In front of me a middle-aged man wearing a Trump flag as a cape told a young man standing beside him “There’s gonna be a war.” His tone was resigned as if he were at last embracing a truth that he had long resisted. “I’m ready to fight” he said. The young man nodded. He had a thin mustache and hugged a life-size mannequin with duct tape over its eyes “traitor” scrawled on its chest and a noose around its neck.  “We want to be so nice” Trump said. “We want to be so respectful of everybody including bad people. We’re going to have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.” About a mile and a half away at the east end of the Mall Vice-President Pence and both houses of Congress had convened to certify the Electoral College votes that had made Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the next President and Vice-President of the United States. In December a hundred and forty Republican representatives—two-thirds of the caucus—had said that they would formally object to the certification of several swing states. Fourteen Republican senators led by Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas had joined the effort. The lawmakers lacked the authority to overturn the election but Trump and his allies had concocted a fantastical alternative: Pence as the presiding officer of the Senate could single-handedly nullify votes from states that Biden had won. Pence though had advised Congress that the Constitution constrained him from taking such action. “After this we’re going to walk down and I’ll be there with you” Trump told the crowd. The people around me exchanged looks of astonishment and delight. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them—because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength.””
