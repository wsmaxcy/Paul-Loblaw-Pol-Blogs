L, Capitol Rioter Proudly Played Video At Dentist's Office, Ed Scarce, 2021-05-20, Another patient turned in Warmus after hearing him bragging about what he'd done on January 6th actually showing others video he had taken. Note to rioters: America is not on your side. Source: Washington Post Less than a week after the failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol a patient at a dentist’s office in western New York couldn’t believe what was being said nearby. During a routine checkup on Jan. 12 a patient listened in as an alleged rioter who was getting his teeth cleaned bragged about his breach of the building according to federal authorities. Daniel Warmus of Alden N.Y. talked of smoking marijuana inside the Capitol and refusing a police officer’s order to leave the building and even proudly played a video from Jan. 6 a federal complaint states. After the patient “overheard Warmus talking about his experience while at a dentist’s office” the person who authorities said wished to remain anonymous alerted the FBI and passed along Warmus’s phone number and home address. That mundane trip to the dentist’s office led to an investigation that concluded this week with Warmus 37 in police custody. Insurrectionist Daniel Warmus who smoked marijuana inside the Capitol was just tracked down and arrested in Alden NY tonight. https://t.co/J2NQHFYgv4 pic.twitter.com/mOn0mgeK1n — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) May 19 2021 The FBI has gotten tips about Capitol rioters from spouses ex-spouses co-workers colleagues former classmates.The one that led to the arrest of Daniel Warmus may be the first to have come from an eavesdropper at the dentist's office. pic.twitter.com/AMAu1LCkHY — Alan Feuer (@alanfeuer) May 18 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
