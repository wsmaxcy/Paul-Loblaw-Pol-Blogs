L, Multiculturalism (Snark), Trenz Pruca, 2021-04-20, Multiculturalism: What is it about the right-wing conservatives and multiculturalism? What are they afraid of? Ultimately what anyone who has an intimate connection with another culture really learns is that they have as little regard for your cultural shibboleths as you have for theirs. Maybe that’s it no one likes to know they are insignificant to someone else’s consciousness. On the other hand I am not particularly turned on by some liberal's rejection of their culture or obsession with its perceived faults. It reminds me of some insecure neurotic going around focused on his or her own inadequacies. And why do many people who should know better gush over another culture’s obsessions? Hell no one goes around loving everybody. There are a lot of people I can’t stand and believe that the world or at least my little piece of it would have been better off had their mother gotten an abortion. And that includes my old college mate Pat Buchanan. Similarly there are a lot of cultures or cultural adaptations I can’t stand. The goose-stepping aspect of German culture for example and a lot of elements of some Arab cultures. That goes for my own slice of pizza with pepperoni Italian-American culture as well. For example I found Jersey Shore revolting but the Godfather somehow ennobling. Perhaps it is because I could more picture myself like Michael shooting someone in the head than spending my days in the gym working on my six-pack like the Situation. Also although I hate to admit it I find myself more turned on by that bag of nuts played by Diane Keaton than by the big busted bimbo that shares my nickname Pookie. So sue me.
