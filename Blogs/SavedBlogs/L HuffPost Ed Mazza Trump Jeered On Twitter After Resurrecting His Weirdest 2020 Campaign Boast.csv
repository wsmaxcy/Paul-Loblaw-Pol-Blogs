L, Trump Jeered On Twitter After Resurrecting His Weirdest 2020 Campaign Boast, Ed Mazza, 2021-07-01, Donald Trump has once again boasted of his ability to pass a test meant to detect dementia resurrecting the famous “person... woman... man... camera... TV” moment of the 2020 campaign.  The former president brought it up on Wednesday when he was with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R):  Person Woman Man Camera TV: It's 2021 and Trump is still bragging about that easy cognitive test. pic.twitter.com/o2EenwQmUy Then it came up again later in the day during an interview with Abbott conducted by Fox News host and Trump superfan Sean Hannity:  And we’re back to talking about the cognitive test pic.twitter.com/uuQg9wDRwN Last year Trump bragged that doctors found it “amazing” that he had passed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) a test that is supposed to be easy as it is not a measure of intelligence but rather a way to look for signs of cognitive impairment.  An example of the test is here. It became one of the most memorable memes of the campaign trail and not in a good way for Trump. So his critics were puzzled about his decision to keep harping on it almost a year later: You get 6 points if you can correctly identify the date and the city in which the test is taking place. Congratulations Mr. President. https://t.co/eL3BX0xLQ3 The dude is doing the "person woman man camera TV" bit again.

We have just 5 words for him: Person Woman Man Camera TV. this is like the 70-year-old guy who won't stop reminiscing about winning the big game in high school only way way dumber https://t.co/slFeJgbw5n It’s shocking that he passed actually. He’s cheated on every other test he’s ever taken. https://t.co/dyGL8Pq9aZ And Britney Spears is the one in a conservatorship. https://t.co/rH2mw6I9vd Person. Woman. Man. Camera.
