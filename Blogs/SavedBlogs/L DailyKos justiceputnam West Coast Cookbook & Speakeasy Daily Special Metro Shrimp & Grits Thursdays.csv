Starting off in the Bistro Cafe many former prosecutors and US attorneys don’t think this is the first search warrant the SDNY has obtained in the Giuliani case.  Then on the rest of the menu the Texas GOP official suing Biden over aid to Black farmers has a history of hateful comments; the first woman of color to lead the US securities watchdog's enforcement division resigned after only five days on the job due to potential conflicts of interest; and the US Labor Board said a retail union's evidence in this months Amazon vote in Alabama 'could be grounds for overturning the vote'.  After the break we move to the Chef’s Table where several former members of the Italian Red Brigades were arrested in France; and a Greek extreme-right lawmaker who fled a thirteen year prison sentence is being held in Brussels while awaiting an extradition ruling.
