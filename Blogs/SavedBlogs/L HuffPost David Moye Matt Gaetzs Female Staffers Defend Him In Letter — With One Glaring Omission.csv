L, Matt Gaetz's Female Staffers Defend Him In Letter — With One Glaring Omission, David Moye, 2021-04-08, Female staff members of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) came out in his defense on Thursday without actually coming out in his defense. The congressman is currently being investigated for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl and paying for her to travel across state lines. So far most of the GOP hasn’t publicly supported Gaetz except for Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and tepidly former President Donald Trump. On Thursday as reports circulated that Joel Greenberg a key figure in the Gaetz investigation was considering a plea deal a group calling itself the “Women of U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz’s office” released a statement defending him as “a principled and morally grounded leader.” Gaetz posted the statement as a series of tweets but it was also sent to reporters from Gaetz chief of staff Jillian Wyant’s email. However Wyant did not sign the statement nor did any of the other female staff members who supposedly support Gaetz: After the shocking allegations last week in the press we the women of Congressman Matt Gaetz’s office feel morally obligated to speak out. During Congressman Gaetz’s time in office we have been behind the scenes every step of the way. We have staffed his meetings. We have planned his events. We have traveled with him. And we have tracked his schedule. Congressman Gaetz has always been a principled and morally grounded leader. At no time has any one of us experienced or witnessed anything less than the utmost professionalism and respect. No hint of impropriety. No ounce of untruthfulness. In our office and under Congressman Gaetz’s leadership women are not only respected but have been encouraged time and time again to grow achieve more and ultimately know our value. Many of us started in entry-level positions and have been promoted to positions of leadership within the office. In our professional ecosystem women are given every opportunity to advance and utilize our talents to help the country in the best possible way. On every occasion he has treated each and every one of us with respect. Thus we uniformly reject these allegations as false. Congressman Gaetz will continue to lead by example and stand for the people of America who have been maligned by the liberal elite. And we will stand with him. While we recognize the scrutiny we will face for making this decision we take comfort in the hope that more Americans and elected officials will stand up and refuse to remain silent. Many Twitter users also decided not to remain silent about the statement. Calling them "The Women of..." as if they were a 1980s Penthouse spread is definitely making your case. https://t.co/d1VbjCU309 possibly it's a band name? Not a single one was willing to put their names to this statement. https://t.co/Bei7trtnZz This statement was not signed by any staffers and it did not specify how many women in Gaetz's office had signed off on it.It ambiguously signed from "The Women of U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz's Office Speak Out in Defense of Rep. Gaetz." https://t.co/lwo76hmTvl He is under investigation by the FBI and the DOJ. They can reject the allegations but they can't reject the facts. https://t.co/q7jwMxWytL All other aspects of this aside it's very funny for a congressperson to post BREAKING news and it's a statement from their office. https://t.co/7ZT7wev77B
