Good evening faithful LGBTQ Literature readers. At the beginning of this month I’d planned something completely different for tonight. I spotted a brand-new book very much within my academic wheelhouse that I’d planned to read and dissect in this month’s diary. Unfortunately Amazon had different plans. Those who read the community diaries I frequent might remember my complaints about not receiving this book from Amazon—not once but twice. I still don’t have the book and I think I’m just going to get it from somewhere else. That’s not much consolation for this particular diary though since I confess that I did not have a Plan B. Tomorrow marks the 52nd anniversary of the Stonewall uprising so perhaps it is more fitting to dedicate this month’s diary to that instead as I have in previous June iterations of LGBTQ Literature. I thought about “reprinting” an earlier diary on Stonewall but as I went looking for that previous diary I realized that I’ve actually published a few distinct diaries related to Stonewall. Some of them were more well-read than others. I thought it might be better to just list and link them here as a kind of Stonewall “index”—in case you haven’t seen one of them or in case you just want to revisit them. Here are the Stonewall diaries in order of publication: 1. LGBT Literature: Stonewall (May 31 2015)—This diary reviews two essential books on Stonewall. The first is Martin Duberman’s Stonewall and the second is David Carter’s Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution. 2. LGBT Literature: Stonewall Reprint (June 26 2016)—This diary is a “reprint” of the first Stonewall diary and a reminder that apparently I have problems with writing new diaries in June. Most of the content is the same but it has an opening that reflects on President Obama designating the Stonewall Inn as the first national LGBTQ monument. Rereading this diary I’m also reminded that I wrote this in the aftermath of the Pulse massacre in what turned out to be a very emotional and traumatic Pride Month. 3. LGBTQ Literature: Stonewall (June 30 2019)—This diary reviews The Stonewall Reader a primary source reader edited by the New York Public Library (with a foreward by Edmund White). The reader features primary sources from both the pre- and post-Stonewall periods. 4. LGBTQ Literature: The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary History (June 28 2020)—This diary reviews The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary History a primary source reader edited by Marc Stein. This particular reader is fascinating not just for its primary sources but for its introduction which delves into a historical and historiographical discussion of Stonewall. I hope you find something new to read or maybe just something interesting to revisit. We’ll be back to original content next month. Happy Pride!
