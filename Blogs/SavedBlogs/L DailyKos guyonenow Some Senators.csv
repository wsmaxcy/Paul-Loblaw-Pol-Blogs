L, Some Senators, guyonenow, 2021-05-10, I was thinking about our Senators in Washington.  It brought to mind a situation where a fairy tale explains it.  Seems there is a reticence to leave a belief behind especially in one group of Senators.  Reading this tale will illustrate what is happening.The Tale is called "The Emperor has New Clothes"  Good chance you have read this when younger.  Just google it!  It is by Hans Christian Anderson and a bit long but easy reading if your get curious to my meaning!  Many will get the point and find it hilarious when applied to my thoughts.
