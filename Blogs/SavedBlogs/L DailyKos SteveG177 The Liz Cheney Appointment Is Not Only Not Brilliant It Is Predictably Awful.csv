L, The Liz Cheney Appointment Is Not Only Not Brilliant It Is Predictably Awful, SteveG177, 2021-07-03, This is re-posted from a post of mine last night as a response to a different diary here with a couple of minor edits.  I felt it deserved its own space.   — I am not at all surprised that Pelosi who I am extremely critical of is putting a Republican onto a committee where the literal fate of the country is at hand.  I mean there are only 5 Republicans that McCarthy gets to appoint (if he wants)—that obviously just wasn’t enough to make it a bipartisan commission.  Any commission that seeks to find whether one political party has active co-conspirators in an ongoing and deadly insurrectionist movement should have as many of its members appointed as possible right?  Appointed by the head of the OTHER party?   Makes perfect sense.  I’m sure Newt Gingrich would have put extra Democrats onto his commissions about alleged Clintonian malfeasance just for the sake of “fairness” right?  I’m sure McConnell would do the same in the Senate. So let’s run through the wonderful things that this accomplishes. 1.  Cheney who is utterly awful on virtually everything will get her name further lionized and rehabilitated by not just the clueless both-siderist MSM but by the Democrats!  What a lovely gift to put her in the history books for being a broken clock.  Maybe her war-criminal father will sign the books for us! 2.  She will be seen as a “moderate voice of reason” shifting the Overton Window of acceptable “moderates” ever further Right.  Why is everything even slightly Leftwing painted as totally impossible and radical by the MSM?  In part because their Serious Adults on the Sunday Shows are “moderates” like The Great Principled Defender of the Republic Liz Cheney and thus even Center-Left PMC Liberals like Corey Booker seem out-of-step with “The Center of Washington” let alone Rashida Tlaib.      3.  Not a single Republican voter or politician will give Pelosi credit for this move nor consider the commission more “legitimate” just because Cheney is on it nor give any credence to anything she says.  Democratic voters already believe Trump is guilty so there’s nothing to gain from either party.  It’s just Pelosi’s utter obsession with coddling the Right whether it be Rightwing Democrats or Rightwing #Resistancers. 4.  This will make the commission 7-to-6 Democrats.  If there are any recommendations that break down by party line is it an absolute certainty that all 7 Democrats will agree?  If not whoops Republicans will get to determine the policy.  Why hamstring our party unnecessarily like this?  No f*cking reason it’s just Pelosi’s latest greatest hit alongside PayGo and means-testing and praise for Pete Peterson and his Entitlement-cutting infatuation. 5.  The only thing that will come out of Cheney’s involvement will be “the president doesn’t get to actually steal the election outright or by mob.”  That will become the only standard.  Hey how about stealing it by voter suppression?  How about stealing it by having billionaires dump in so much money that it totally dupes the average voter?  How about essentially stealing it by not letting the party in power govern at all because every single bill is filibustered?  Oh those will still be ok.  We’ll confine the conversation to the very very least we can possibly do because Liz Cheney agrees with all of the other Republican fascist initiatives.  By the way probably including beefing up security again so that they can crack more skulls of Leftwing and Black protesters exactly like always happens when the Right determines our security protocols.   6.  It will just become a personality fight between Cheney and other Republicans both on and off of the committee.  “Which one is the patriot and which one is the traitor?”  If this commission is supposed to delve into the real reasons for this insurrection including White Supremacy in our police departments massive cynicism among voters the violent tendencies of the Right etc that is all going to be overshadowed.  Instead of theoretically having 8 serious people it will be one less serious person and one more attention-seeker trying to build a brand for herself. 7.  It perpetuates the falsehood that Republicans are an important and necessary part of the conversation and must be included in the most ardent of our priorities.  I mean we can’t possibly actually run AGAINST Republicans as a party we just have to seek their sage advice one more time.  It’s not like she will be just another member she will be the most media-discussed most scrutinized and most revered person on the committee.  Again the message is “look at how reasonable Republicans can be.  Don’t vote for the bad Republicans but you should obviously consider voting for the reasonable Republicans!!!  The Democratic Party who is supposed to be in charge because the voters voted for it?  Oh don’t mind us we found a Republican to trash Trump and clearly a Republican’s opinion about important things like this is worth more than ours!!!  Hey maybe we can get more Republicans to speak up against Trump when it is convenient for them and then we’ll just keep propping up and funding The Good Republicans who hate the big orange baby like we do!  Wait that wasn’t what the Lincoln Grifter Project was?”  So great job once again Speaker Pelosi.  No upside total downside completely unnecessary pandering to a Republican for no reason.  Such a genius to give our party LESS power for the sake of the great Impartial Serious Adult Log In the Sky that no one has cared about but corporate Democrats and the corporate media for 25 years.  But then let’s all call it a masterstroke because “you got one more over on Trump” and trolling is apparently your job not actually fighting for anything.  Maybe Liz Cheney can rip up a speech or clap sideways to really indicate her #Resistance bona fides?  She’s certainly not going to convince anyone that hasn’t already paid enough attention to make a conclusion.  But she’ll probably set herself up nicely for a nice cushy big-money career on CNN for doing this.  Thanks for helping her.
