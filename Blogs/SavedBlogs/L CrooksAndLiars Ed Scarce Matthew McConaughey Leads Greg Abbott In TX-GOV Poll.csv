L, Matthew McConaughey Leads Greg Abbott In TX-GOV Poll, Ed Scarce, 2021-04-19, It's a long ways away but these kind of numbers should give Texas Republicans pause. Greg Abbott's general bungling and indifference to Texans dying from Covid the power grid failure snowstorms etc has created an opening for someone like the actor Matthew McConaughey should he decide to throw his hat in the ring. It won't be easy of course. Republicans have the election machinery in place to bump the numbers up substantially but a popular Democrat versus an unpopular incumbent can make for a winnable race especially with solid organization and grassroots support. One to keep an eye on anyway. McConaughey has expressed interest but who knows if he'll actually run. Seems like a serious paycut. Source: Dallas News Matthew McConaughey commands more support to be Texas’ next governor than incumbent Greg Abbott according to a poll released Sunday by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler. However the film actor and political newcomer could hit potholes in either major party’s primary if he enters next year’s governor’s race the poll found. For months McConaughey has teased political pundits and TV talk show hosts with musings that he might enter politics in his home state. If he were to take the plunge and run for governor the poll found 45% of Texas registered voters would vote for McConaughey 33% would vote for Abbott and 22% would vote for someone else. McConaughey’s double-digit lead over the two-term Republican incumbent is significant. The poll conducted April 6-13 surveyed 1126 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.92 percentage points. Matthew McConaughey may be a viable candidate for Texas governor; poll shows actor ahead of Abbott https://t.co/affWEzuAk5 — David Jolly (@DavidJollyFL) April 18 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
