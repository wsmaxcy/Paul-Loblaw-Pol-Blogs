C, “What Am I Doing Here?”, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-28, We would all like to know the answer to that question Joe. Biden’s dementia proceeds apace: “What am I doing here? I’m going to lose track here.” pic.twitter.com/ojs7g8S7aj — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) February 27 2021  
I assume that Biden is not serving as president in any meaningful sense. Normally he would have delivered an address to a joint session of Congress by this time like past presidents. But he hasn’t done so. The White House says that Biden will give such a speech (not technically a State of the Union as I understand it but functionally identical) at some point but no date has been set. It is doubtful whether he can do it notwithstanding that all he has to do is read. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
