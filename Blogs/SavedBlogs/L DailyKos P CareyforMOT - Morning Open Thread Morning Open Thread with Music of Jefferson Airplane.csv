L, Morning Open Thread with Music of Jefferson Airplane, P CareyforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-07-01,  Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve come to think of this post as one where you come for the music and stay for the conversation—so feel free to drop a note. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. Good morning everyone and welcome to Thursday’s Morning Open Thread.  I do hope you’ve had a pleasant week so far and have managed to avoid the excessive heat in most places or the ungodly amounts of rain in the remaining. Work has been a dance defined by moving crews just ahead of violent storms blooming just off the gulf coast and moving through like a vengeful preacher. Still we haven’t washed away and the only immediate downside of all this water is the number of snakes making it to my yard and patio—a 4’ northern water has moved in temporarily but that’s so much better than the moccasins people are dealing with farther down the bayou.  I like to count my blessings some mornings just to remind myself what a lucky person I am. Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s that your situation could be worse and there are always people living farther down the bayou than you. Cheers everyone and have a wonderful day as we march toward a three-day weekend and bunches of mini-explosive devices in the hands of people too young or too drunk to know better.   ❧      ​​​​​​​ ❧ ☕️ Grab your coffee or tea and join us please. What's on your mind this morning?
