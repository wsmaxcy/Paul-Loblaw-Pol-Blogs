L, Lindsey Graham: People Trying To Erase Donald Trump Will 'Wind Up Getting Erased’, Lee Moran, 2021-05-11, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) put his devotion to Donald Trump on full display once again Monday. Graham talking with fellow Trump sycophant Sean Hannity of Fox News doubled down on his adulation of the ex-president by claiming that trying to erase Trump from the GOP “is insane.” The South Carolina Republican also issued this warning: “The people who try to erase him are going to wind up getting erased.” Graham’s comments came as the GOP plotted to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from House Republican leadership over her opposition to Trump’s lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. “It’s impossible for this party to move forward without President Trump being its leader because the people who are conservative have chosen him as their leader” Graham said. “And you know why they chose him? Because he delivered.” Watch the video here: Lindsey Graham on Trump: "The people who are trying to erase him are going to wind up getting erased.” pic.twitter.com/oNxbjOLeF5 It’s a far cry from Graham’s anti-Trump tweet in 2016: If we nominate Trump we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
