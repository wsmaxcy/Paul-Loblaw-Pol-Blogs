C, Loose Ends (125), Steven Hayward, 2021-02-11, • Tweet of the day from my pal Rebeccah Heinrichs of the Hudson Institute:  I’ll skip over how Biden is eating his own lunch these days. • Spot the blooper here:  Allies? China?? Probably Andrea Mitchell again. Chaser:  Pass the popcorn someone. I’m all out. • Irony alert: 8-Year-Old Calls Out NPR For Lack Of Dinosaur Stories An 8-year-old from Minneapolis recently pointed out a big problem with NPR’s oldest news show All Things Considered. Leo Shidla wrote to his local NPR station: My name is Leo and I am 8 years old. I listen to All Things Considered in the car with mom. I listen a lot. I never hear much about nature or dinosaurs or things like that. Maybe you should call your show Newsy things Considered since I don’t get to hear about all the things. Or please talk more about dinosaurs and cool things. Sincerely Leo Leo: You have this exactly backward. This is NPR we’re talking about. All of their stories are “dinosaur stories.” • From the International Energy Agency: “Over the last four years the United States had the biggest decline in carbon emissions of any of the major signatories to the Paris Climate Accord.” • Finally a nice two-minute compilation of Democratic hypocrisy on “stolen elections” and sanctioning violence:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
