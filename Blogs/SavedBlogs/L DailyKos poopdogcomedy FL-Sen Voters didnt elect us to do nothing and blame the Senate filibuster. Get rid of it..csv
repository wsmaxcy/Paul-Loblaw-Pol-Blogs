L, FL-Sen: "Voters didn't elect us to do nothing and blame the Senate filibuster. Get rid of it.", poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-27, U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Val Demings (D. FL-10) has a must read op-ed in USA Today where she makes a compelling argument to get rid of the filibuster: The filibuster threatens the freedoms of every American.The solution to all our problems is more democracy not less.https://t.co/6HA5JKP456  Many arguments have been advanced to defend the filibuster. That it was established by the Founding Fathers (false). That it fosters bipartisanship (history shows otherwise). That without it we might become a “parliamentary government” (nonsense). Others have argued that the filibuster is a necessary safety net – that while it may be stopping us from passing good legislation now we will want it around when the other party tries to pass bad legislation later.  But the people voted. They chose their representatives. We cannot simply sit on our hands doing nothing during critical national emergencies. It’s true that perhaps the other party will take power and perhaps they will pass legislation that I believe would be bad for middle class families across our nation. But that’s how a democracy works.  As President Franklin D. Roosevelt said “government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials but the voters of this country.” Our Constitution puts its trust in the American people. So do I. Democracy is an act of faith. America was an audacious gamble what former President Barack Obama called the “audacity of hope;” a belief that we the people can build a better future together. Please give it a read and then click here to contact your Democratic Senator and tell them you favor abolishing the filibuster and filibuster reform. Also big things are happening in Florida: The Florida Democratic Party (FDP) is hiring seven field directors across the state as the party looks to increase its grassroots organizing investment this cycle. A document obtained by Florida Politics lays out the new hires which the FDP says “show a commitment to building the sustainable grassroots organizing systems needed to win in Florida.” Florida Democratic Party Chair Manny Diaz also added a statement arguing the hires will help Democrats get a head start on high-profile 2022 contests. “By investing early in statewide grassroots organizing we will meet Florida voters where they are now not just 3 months before each election” Diaz said. “To flip Florida blue we are building a longterm sustainable infrastructure and deploying field staff all across Florida earlier than ever. Our field team is the heart of the foundation necessary to defeat Marco Rubio Ron DeSantis and Republicans up and down the ballot.” Democracy is on the ballot. Let’s flip Florida Blue next year.
