L, A Photo Of The Bidens With The Carters Is Freaking Everyone Out, Lee Moran, 2021-05-05, A photograph of the Bidens and the Carters has gone viral because of the weird way the current occupants of the White House appear to be towering over their predecessors. The Carter Center shared the image from President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden’s recent visit to former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter on Twitter late Monday: We’re pleased to share this wonderful photo from the @POTUS and @FLOTUS visit to see the Carters in Plains Ga.! Thank you President and Mrs. Biden! pic.twitter.com/QcA33iUev4 Photographers suggested the strange effect was caused by a wide-angle lens in a small space or perspective distortion. That didn’t stop late night comedians from riffing on the image Tuesday. “What the fuck is going on in this photo?” asked “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah. “Why do the Bidens look five times higher than the Carters? Is there some dollhouse filter I don’t know about?” “Honestly this is the weirdest picture of a president since any picture of Donald Trump” Noah cracked. Check out the video here: What the f**k is going on with this photo of the Bidens and Carters? Is there some "doll house filter" we didn't know about? pic.twitter.com/UHdOdC8avj “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon said he learned two things from the image ― that the two families are close and “Biden is the size of Jason Momoa.” Watch the video here: People on Twitter also offered funny observations: Honey I Shrunk the Carters looks hilarious. pic.twitter.com/FAJe7iZs6M So many weird photos of the Bidens and the Carters pic.twitter.com/Snf0TyoSCc Why Joe look like a ventriloquist? pic.twitter.com/pUwSaoS4HO pic.twitter.com/aB0UJWCTOi Joe Biden with The Carters. pic.twitter.com/9m1Ka7t3pb There.

I’ve been staring at this photo for three hours. I’ve got to go to bed. Back at it tomorrow. https://t.co/Nv4KVvCNgv This is the theory I’ve been promoting this evening: pic.twitter.com/2QVnY3vDRv Presidents in Wonderland? https://t.co/NGUbPpOzhR David Lynch outtake from which film? https://t.co/pQ1t6tKZ0W Wait. What are they feeding the Bidens at the White House?! https://t.co/zGjQNmZGm7 Right-wingers meanwhile tried to make political capital out of the fact that none of the four were wearing masks in the image ― even though Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines state that “you can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart.”
