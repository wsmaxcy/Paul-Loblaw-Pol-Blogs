C, CRT Is Sacrosanct and May Not Be Questioned, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-31, Critical Race Theory is a poisonous racist anti-American set of doctrines but we are all supposed to pretend we don’t understand that. Criticism of CRT is forbidden or will be if the Left gets its way. Take the case of Georgia where a state representative has questions about the institutions that his constituents support with their taxes: A Georgia lawmaker is trying to find out whether any of the state’s public universities are teaching about white privilege or oppression part of a larger national debate over how colleges should teach about American history and race relations. University System of Georgia Chancellor Steve Wrigley asked the system’s 26 colleges and universities on Jan. 21 to research the information after state Rep. Emory Dunahoo a Gillsville Republican submitted questions on the topic to Wrigley following budget hearings. Some faculty members are bristling at the questions saying they intrude into a professor’s academic freedom and are part of an effort by Republicans to impose their vision of history and social relations. Conservatives though say they’re fighting left-wing indoctrination by professors. State legislatures have oversight responsibility over public institutions but any time they try to exercise that responsibility it is considered dirty pool. Representative Dunahoo’s questions are entirely reasonable: 1) Are any classes within the Georgia public school system or the University System of Georgia teaching students that possessing certain characteristics inherently designates them as either being “privileged” or “oppressed?” 2) Are any classes within the Georgia public school system or the University System of Georgia teaching students what constitutes “privilege” and “oppression?” 3) Are any classes within the Georgia public school system or the University System of Georgia teaching students who identify as white male heterosexual or Christian are intrinsically privileged and oppressive which is defined as “malicious or unjust” and “wrong?” Inquiring minds want to know! Specifically Dunahoo says his constituents. “The request is an attack on higher education” [English professor Matthew] Boedy said. “It perpetrates a pernicious agenda. I don’t know why a state representative who won his district by 40 points needs to throw red meat to his base but this echoes national conservative discourse that has been laughed from the public square by historians and other experts.” So I take it the answers to the representative’s questions are Yes Yes and Yes. Actually it is Critical Race Theory that deserves to be laughed out of the public square. Or better ridden out on a rail.  Liberals are free to be racist and anti-American but it is hard to understand why taxpayers should be expected to support such evils. Certainly if Georgia’s university system were teaching that the Earth is flat that the South won the Civil War or that the Holocaust is a myth no one would suggest that legislators’ interest is misplaced. But the Left fights tenaciously to protect its most important doctrines from scrutiny. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
