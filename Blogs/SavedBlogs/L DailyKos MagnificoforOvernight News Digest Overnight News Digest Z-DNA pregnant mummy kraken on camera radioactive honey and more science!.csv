Some viruses that infect bacteria use an alternative genetic alphabet that’s distinct from the code used by nearly all other organisms — and now two teams have spelt out how the system works. More than four decades in the making the studies show how dozens of these bacteriophages (or just ‘phages’) as they are known write their genomes using a chemical base called 2-] Z for short instead of adenine — the A in the As Ts Cs and Gs of genetics textbooks. “Scientists have long dreamed of increasing the diversity of bases. Our work shows that nature has already come up with a way to do that” write Suwen Zhao a computational biologist at ShanghaiTech University in China and her team in a 29 April Science paper showing how ‘Z-DNA’ is made. Researchers in France described similar insights in a pair of papers in the same journal. Malaria vaccine shows promise — now come tougher trials A vaccine against malaria has shown promise in early clinical trials raising hopes that it might one day prove to be an effective weapon against one of the world’s biggest killers of children. In a trial in 450 children aged 5–17 months the vaccine called R21 was up to 77% effective at preventing malaria over the course of one year — which if confirmed would clear a 75% effectiveness target set by the World Health Organization. The results are presented in a preprint posted on the server SSRN on 20 April. Genetic effects of Chernobyl radiation In two landmark studies researchers have used cutting-edge genomic tools to investigate the potential health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation a known carcinogen from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine. One study found no evidence that radiation exposure to parents resulted in new genetic changes being passed from parent to child. The second study documented the genetic changes in the tumors of people who developed thyroid cancer after being exposed as children or fetuses to the radiation released by the accident. The findings published around the 35th anniversary of the disaster are from international teams of investigators led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) part of the National Institutes of Health. The studies were published online in Science on April 22. Among COVID-19 survivors an increased risk of death serious illness As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed it has become clear that many survivors -- even those who had mild cases -- continue to manage a variety of health problems long after the initial infection should have resolved. In what is believed to be the largest comprehensive study of long COVID-19 to date researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis showed that COVID-19 survivors -- including those not sick enough to be hospitalized -- have an increased risk of death in the six months following diagnosis with the virus. The researchers also have catalogued the numerous diseases associated with COVID-19 providing a big-picture overview of the long-term complications of COVID-19 and revealing the massive burden this disease is likely to place on the world's population in the coming years. Antarctic ice-sheet melting to lift sea level higher than thought study says Global sea level rise associated with the possible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has been significantly underestimated in previous studies meaning sea level in a warming world will be greater than anticipated according to a new study from Harvard researchers. The report published in Science Advances features new calculations for what researchers refer to as a water expulsion mechanism. This occurs when the solid bedrock the West Antarctic Ice Sheet sits on rebounds upward as the ice melts and the total weight of the ice sheet decreases. The bedrock sits below sea level so when it lifts it pushes water from the surrounding area into the ocean adding to global sea level rise. The new predictions show that in the case of a total collapse of the ice sheet global sea level rise estimates would be amplified by an additional meter within 1000 years. One incredible ocean crossing may have made human evolution possible Humans evolved in Africa along with chimpanzees gorillas and monkeys. But primates themselves appear to have evolved elsewhere—likely in Asia—before colonizing Africa. At the time around 50 million years ago Africa was an island isolated from the rest of the world by ocean—so how did primates get there? A land bridge is the obvious explanation but the geological evidence currently argues against it. Instead we're left with a far more unlikely scenario: early primates may have rafted to Africa floating hundreds of miles across oceans on vegetation and debris. Such oceanic dispersal was once seen as far-fetched and wildly speculative by many scientists. Some still support the land bridge theory either disputing the geological evidence or arguing that primate ancestors crossed into Africa long before the current fossil record suggests before the continents broke up. Scientists scour the Amazon for pathogens that could spark the next pandemic When Marcelo Gordo opens the picnic cooler the stench is suffocating. Three dead pied tamarin monkeys their cream-and-caramel-colored coats visible through plastic wrap are curled up inside. Gordo a biologist at the Federal University of Amazonas Manaus explains that a student accidentally unplugged the freezer where he’d stored the monkeys which had been killed on the road and given to him by city officials. Despite the decay they are worth investigating. Inside the spartan necropsy room at a veterinary school here veterinarian Alessandra Nava and two graduate students pull on goggles N95 masks and blue nitrile gloves and begin to cut bits of tissue and collect bodily fluids from the monkeys. They pack the samples into vials to be transported to the Fiocruz Amazônia Biobank a pathogen research collection that Nava helps oversee at the Amazonian regional office of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation a branch of Brazil’s Ministry of Health more commonly known as Fiocruz. There she and others will test the samples for parasitic worms viruses and other infectious agents. Nava and her colleagues are on the front lines of the search for animal diseases that could spill over and infect humans—and perhaps cause the next pandemic.  Sponges can crawl but it costs them bits of their bodies Sea sponges don’t move or so many scientists believed. But researchers report today in Current Biology that deep in the Arctic Sea sponges do creep and they sacrifice pieces of their own bodies to do so. During an Arctic expedition scientists aboard the icebreaker Polarstern surveyed an underwater mountain ridge using a boat-towed camera and a remote-controlled aquatic vehicle. At depths between 1000 and 580 meters beyond the reach of sunlight the researchers observed a thriving community of sponges. They also found snaking trails of spicules—fragments of the sponge skeleton—connected to many of the creatures. The researchers ruled out gravity and currents as likely sponge-moving forces because many of the animals were plopped on the uphill ends of these trails and because the site lacked evidence of strong flows. Instead the sponges are moving on their own the team concludes. The cicadas are back a reminder of how many changes have occurred in our lives in 17 years. It was 2004 and my then-16-year-old daughter Merry stood in the driveway of our Fairfax Station home listening to the din of cicadas gathering in the surrounding woods. “Do you realize Mom” she said “the next time the cicadas come you’ll probably be a grandmother?” I did the math quickly in my head. “You’ll be 33 and your brother will be 36” I said. “I’ll be 66.” Seventeen years. A lifetime for a cicada and a mini-lifetime for a human. How do pelicans glide gracefully above waves? Paper uncovers physics behind maneuvers. One of the pleasures of a trip to the beach is watching pelicans and other birds gliding above the waves as they break along the shoreline. Even on still days they stay aloft without flapping their wings. A paper in the journal Movement Ecology unravels the complicated physics behind the graceful maneuver. Mechanical engineers at the University of California at San Diego wanted to know more about the birds’ moves. So they applied theories from physics and mechanical engineering to help determine how the birds interact with their environment. It turns out the pelicans use updrafts generated by breaking ocean waves to stay aloft without flapping their wings. The waves help them save about 60 to 70 percent of the energy they would ordinarily use while flying steadily. Radioactive Fallout From Cold War Nuclear Tests Is Still Creeping Into U.S. Honey A spring break assignment for geology students has resulted in the discovery of radioactive isotopes in honey produced along the U.S. East Coast and at levels higher than expected. The amount of radiation isn’t considered dangerous but the finding points to the drawn-out legacy of nuclear tests done during the Cold War. Back in 2017 first-year geology students at William & Mary in Virginia were asked to collect food samples during their spring break. The purpose of the exercise was to demonstrate how even 60 years later radioactive fallout from Cold War nuclear tests is still lingering in our foods. The samples yielded the typical traces but things got weird when Jim Kaste the lead author of the new study and an associate professor at the university’s Department of Geology used his gamma detector to scan a sample of honey showing the radioactive isotope cesium-137 at levels 100 times higher than the other foods. The Asteroid Impact Simulation Has Ended in Disaster An international exercise to simulate an asteroid striking Earth has come to an end. With just six days to go before a fictitious impact things don’t look good for a 185-mile-wide region between Prague and Munich. Two years ago the organizers of this event accidentally destroyed New York City and now it’s time for a border region intersecting Germany Austria and Czech Republic to meet the same fate. When I covered the early days of this week’s simulation on Wednesday the gathered experts were weighing their options as a 460-foot-wide asteroid barreled toward Central Europe. This may sound like a grim role-playing game but it’s very serious business. Led by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies the asteroid impact simulation is meant to prepare scientists planners and key decision makers for the real thing should it ever occur. Scientists warn of looming water crisis with millions of wells at risk Groundwater cached below the Earth’s surface is one of the world’s most precious resources. Nearly half of the human population depends on these reserves for our daily needs and for agriculture. But up to a fifth of wells worldwide that tap into these reserves are at risk of running drying a recent study in Science has found. A related commentary published in the same journal called the new paper “a timely warning that universal access to groundwater is fundamentally at risk.” The researchers analyzed 39 million wells in 40 countries and territories. By looking at locations purposes and construction records they estimated that between 6 and 20% of the wells were no deeper than 5 meters (16 feet) from the groundwater level. If the water table dips by even a few meters the study authors warn these wells would run dry. Reversing warming quickly could prevent worst climate change effects: Study Catastrophic irreversible environmental tipping points — such as the melting of polar icecaps — could be avoided even if we exceed global climate emissions reduction targets provided we are able to reverse that overshoot quickly according to a study published in the journal Nature last week. The 2009 Planetary Boundaries framework proposed nine key Earth System processes and described tipping points brought on by human exploitation beyond which the system could shift irreversibly into a new climatic state — one in which human civilizations would find it difficult to survive. Biden Tells Congress Climate Action and Job Creation Are the Same President Biden didn’t blink on climate change. In his first joint address to Congress Biden last night outlined a transformative vision of muscular government with climate policy driving both domestic and international affairs. He cast decarbonization as an engine of his economic plans. And he framed competition with China as a struggle over the future of clean energy. “We are at an inflection point in history” Biden said. “If we act to save the planet we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity.” Those words carried extra weight because Biden is facing a choice between fighting for his climate agenda or reaching a bipartisan infrastructure agreement with Republicans who consider his clean energy proposals a deal breaker. Flu Has Disappeared Worldwide during the COVID Pandemic Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread influenza cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to minuscule levels. The reason epidemiologists think is that the public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from spreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in much the same way as SARS-CoV-2 but they are less effective at jumping from host to host. As Scientific American reported last fall the drop-off in flu numbers was both swift and universal. Since then cases have stayed remarkably low. “There’s just no flu circulating” says Greg Poland who has studied the disease at the Mayo Clinic for decades. The U.S. saw about 600 deaths from influenza during the 2020-2021 flu season. In comparison the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated there were roughly 22000 deaths in the prior season and 34000 two seasons ago. A Revolution Is Sweeping the Science of Ancient Diseases When Johannes Krause was a graduate student working on the Neanderthal genome in the 2000s so much of the DNA recovered from the ancient bone fragments came from everything else: the skin cells of excavators and scientists the bacteria on those humans the microbes in the soil. To get to Neanderthal DNA you had to junk the rest. Once scientists figured out how they rushed to sequence not just Neanderthal DNA but also ancient human DNA which together have been rewriting the early history of our species. Only later did scientists realize that there is gold in the “junk” too.   Researchers ‘shocked’ to find Egyptian mummy was a pregnant woman Polish researchers examining an ancient Egyptian mummy that they expected to be a male priest were surprised when X-rays and computer tests revealed instead that it was a mummy of a woman who had been seven months pregnant. […] “Our first surprise was that it has no penis but instead it has breasts and long hair and then we found out that it’s a pregnant woman” Marzena Ozarek-Szilke an anthropologist and archeologist told the Associated Press. “When we saw the little foot and then the little hand [of the foetus] we were really shocked.” The researchers estimated the woman was between 20 and 30 years old and said the size of the baby’s skull suggested she was 26 to 28 weeks pregnant. Scientists find way to remove polluting microplastics with bacteria Microbiologists have devised a sustainable way to remove polluting microplastics from the environment – and they want to use bacteria to do the job. Bacteria naturally tend to group together and stick to surfaces and this creates an adhesive substance called “biofilm” – we see it every morning when brushing our teeth and getting rid of dental plaque for example. Researchers at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) want to use this sticky bacteria property and create tape-like microbe nets that can capture microplastics in polluted water to form an easily disposable and recyclable blob. Although these findings presented on Wednesday at the Microbiology Society’s annual conference are still preliminary this invention could pave the way for sustainably lowering plastic pollution levels in the long run by simply using something found in nature. Climate crisis: our children face wars over food and water EU deputy warns Older people will have to make sacrifices in the fight against climate change or today’s children will face a future of fighting wars for water and food the EU’s deputy chief has warned. Frans Timmermans vice-president of the EU commission said that if social policy and climate policy are not combined to share fairly the costs and benefits of creating a low-carbon economy the world will face a backlash from people who fear losing jobs or income stoked by populist politicians and fossil fuel interests. He said: “It’s not just an urgent matter – it’s a difficult matter. We have to transform our economy. There are huge benefits but it’s a huge challenge. The biggest threat is the social one. If we don’t fix this our children will be waging wars over water and food. There is no doubt in my mind.” Why we're anxious about returning to normal ― and what we can do about it Most of us want lockdowns and restrictions to be over. But that doesn't mean going out into the world again will be easy. DW's Carla Bleiker asked mental health experts how to deal with post-pandemic anxiety. It was a fun first half of the day: On a recent weekend I met a friend in downtown Bonn to check out the city's famous cherry blossoms. We took some photos grabbed a coffee and did our shopping at the local farmers market then stopped by a patisserie to pick up a sweet treat for lunch ― all of course while wearing our masks. As were most of the people around us. We were being safe we had a good time and it was a welcome break from all the time I had been spending alone in my apartment these days. Then why did I still feel utterly exhausted by the time I got home? Normally in the "before" world I would not have had to lie down for half an hour after spending a nice spring morning with a friend outside. 1 Billion-Year-Old Fossil Could Be The Oldest Multicellular Animal on Record A teeny tiny fossil found in the Scottish Highlands could be a missing link in the evolutionary history of animals. Dated to around a billion years ago the microfossil shows evidence of two distinctly different types of cells and it seems to belong to an ancient organism somewhere between unicellular and multicellular animals. This makes it possibly the oldest fossil of its kind on record a discovery that could provide insight into how and where animal life evolved. "The origins of complex multicellularity and the origin of animals are considered two of the most important events in the history of life on Earth our discovery sheds new light on both of these" said palaeobiologist Charles Wellman of the University of Sheffield in the UK. Fish May Actually Feel Pain After All Argues a New Paper The parts of the human brain that process the unpleasantness of pain have no equivalent in the brains of fish. So does that mean fish aren't able to feel pain? Not necessarily according to a new paper. […] "While our study cannot prove that fish feel pain we can assert that arguments relying on a lack of certain brain structures to deny pain in fish look increasingly untenable" says Kenneth Williford a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Arlington. Or to put it another way: Claiming that fish don't feel pain due to the absence of certain brain regions is like concluding they can't swim because they don't have the arms and legs that humans do according to the authors of the paper. How scientists caught footage of 'the kraken' after centuries of searching Architeuthis dux — the world's largest known squid — is surprisingly camera shy. […] Despite their size these cephalopods are almost never seen in the water; most observations of the behemoths come from dead or dying squids that wash up on shores or become ensnared in deep-sea trawling nets. That finally changed in 2012 when a team of marine scientists filmed a young A. dux in its natural habitat about 2000 feet (630 m) below the sea south of Japan. Now a study published online in the journal Deep Sea Research Part 1: Oceanographic Research Papers delves into why these giants of the deep are so elusive and explains how a team of researchers was able to capture the first footage of A. dux in its natural habitat in 2012 and again in 2019 in the Gulf of Mexico. Dark matter could be destroying itself inside the bellies of exoplanets Large gaseous exoplanets could be filled with self-destructing dark matter. And now a team of researchers has proposed using the soon-to-be-launched James Webb Space Telescope to scan distant behemoths in the galaxy for potential heating effects that could arise from the mysterious substance which outweighs regular matter by almost 6 to 1 in the universe. Physicists know dark matter exists because it tugs gravitationally on stars and galaxies. But so far the invisible material has foiled every attempt to better understand its properties. Michael Collins who piloted the Apollo 11 command module has died Michael Collins—a two-time astronaut who piloted the command module during the historic Apollo 11 mission that landed the first humans on the Moon—died on Wednesday after battling cancer his family said. He was 90 years old. "He spent his final days peacefully with his family by his side" the family said in a statement. "Mike always faced the challenges of life with grace and humility and faced this his final challenge in the same way. We will miss him terribly." White House says Vice President Kamala Harris will chair the space council The National Space Council will continue operations under the Biden administration and Vice President Kamala Harris will chair the organization. Senior administration officials confirmed this on a call with reporters on Saturday and said the White House process to hire an executive secretary to manage the council is "well underway." The National Space Council oversees the three main areas of US space activities—national security civil space and commercial space. After it was dormant from 1993 to 2017 President Donald Trump reconstituted the body to advise his administration on space policy. Vice President Mike Pence chaired the council and Scott Pace served as executive secretary.
