L, Capitol Rioter Seen At Event For Rudy Giuliani And PA State Sen. Doug Mastriano, Ed Scarce, 2021-05-18, You might ask yourself "What is FBI suspect No 275 doing at a political event for Rudy Giuliani and Pennsylvania State Sen. Doug Mastriano despite a warrant out for his arrest?" Well many are wondering the exact same thing. Source: Huffington Post A militant Donald Trump supporter whose photo is featured on an FBI wanted list because he was caught on video battling with police officers at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 attended a political event last week for a Trump-loving Pennsylvania politician who backed the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The event’s headliner: Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani who called for “trial by combat” during his speech on Jan. 6 and whose phones and computers were seized in a Justice Department investigation last month. Samuel Lazar who is Capitol suspect No. 275 on the FBI website posed for photos alongside right-wing Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) at the May 15 event headlined by Giuliani. A tipster sent the photos to HuffPost after spotting them on Facebook. Both Mastriano and Lazar were at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 though Mastriano claimed he left when he realized the protest was no longer peaceful. Mastriano whose campaign spent thousands of dollars on buses to bring people to D.C. on Jan. 6 later issued a statement saying those who violated the law must be prosecuted. Mastriano’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lazar aka #FacePaintBlowhard is featured in several Twitter videos. In a video shot down the street from the Capitol Lazar told onlookers that they “maced ’em [law enforcement officers] right the fuck back.” “Fuck the tyrants” Lazar said. “We need to hang these motherfuckers.” Reposting #FacepaintBlowhard and newly hashtagged #MagaGalDiceClay giving post riot interview.
