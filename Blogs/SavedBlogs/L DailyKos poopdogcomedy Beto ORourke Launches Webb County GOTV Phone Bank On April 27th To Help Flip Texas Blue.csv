L, Beto O'Rourke Launches Webb County GOTV Phone Bank On April 27th To Help Flip Texas Blue, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-19, Received this e-mail today from former presidential candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D. TX) and his organization Powered By People: I'm personally inviting you to join Beto and Powered by People volunteers next Tuesday April 27 at a virtual phone bank to call voters in Webb County. I've joined Beto on too many phone banks to count but it doesn't matter how many numbers I've dialed – it's always a special experience. I love connecting directly with Texans over the phone. It's one of the easiest and most efficient ways to hear what's on voters' minds and always ends up reminding me just how much we all have in common. Some of the most prevalent concerns that come up when we're talking with voters are school funding and teacher pay COVID-19 relief the pandemic response affordable healthcare voter suppression jobs that pay a living wage and corruption – all issues I often find myself worrying about. If you're free next Tuesday will you commit to joining Beto and Powered by People volunteers at our Webb County phone bank? Everyone is invited and conversational Spanish speakers are encouraged to attend! Webb County Phone Bank with Beto Tuesday April 27 at 6:30PM CT RSVP or learn more >> Conversations like these help our movement to understand what voters need to hear to believe their vote matters and that elections have consequences for their lives. That's why Powered by People is having these conversations now – and not in the weeks just before an election. By starting with listening and understanding all Texans we can grow our movement and elect Democrats in 2022 and beyond. Sam can you join Powered by People volunteers and Beto next Tuesday to make calls to previously identified Democrats in Webb County?
