L, According to religious fanatics..., Perlinator, 2021-05-04,     Here is what fanatics believe is the Gospel Truth: A lot of kind-hearted people are going to Hell in a handbasket and some of the meanest scoundrels you ever met are destined for eternal bliss in Heaven. Why? Because the main thing that matters is not how you lived your life but which religion you picked. So you better make sure you’ve picked the right one!     (Which one is that? Damned if I know.)     The religious fanatics don’t say it in the same words I’ve said it but they do say it. Next time you get hold of one of those stupid little religious fanatic leaflets take a few minutes to actually read it and you’ll see that the message is basically the same as what I have more bluntly re-stated here. It’s a very scary concept if you’re gullible enough to believe it!
