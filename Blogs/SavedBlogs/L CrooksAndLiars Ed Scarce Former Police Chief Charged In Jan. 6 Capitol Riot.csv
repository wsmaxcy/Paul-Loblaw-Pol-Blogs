His lawyer described Hostetter as an "activist." Just another peaceful protester at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. Unfortunately for Hostetter that activist also has a highly visible social media prescence with at least one video calling for executions. That sort of thing usually doesn't sit well with a judge. Oh and one more time he's a former Police Chief for god's sake! No words.
