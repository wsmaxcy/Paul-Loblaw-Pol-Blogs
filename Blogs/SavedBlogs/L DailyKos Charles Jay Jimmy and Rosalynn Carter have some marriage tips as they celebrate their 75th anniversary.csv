L, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have some marriage tips as they celebrate their 75th anniversary, Charles Jay, 2021-07-06, The dashing young midshipman was back home in his small town in southern Georgia while on  summer break from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1945 and needed a date  His younger sister Ruth set him up on a double date with her best friend literally the girl next door whom he had known since childhood. The next morning Jimmy Carter told his mother Lillian that Eleanor Rosalynn Smith is the woman he’s going to marry. Rosalynn said no to his first proposal when he was home for Christmas that year. But a few weeks later she said yes when he proposed again. They were married on July 7 1946 at the United Methodist Church in their hometown of Plains Georgia. He was 21 she was 18. On Wednesday the Carters will be marking their 75th wedding anniversary. They are the longest-married presidential couple (George and Barbara Bush were married for 73 years before she died in 2018). Carter now 96 is the longest-lived president in U.S. history. The former first lady is now 93. In typical fashion the Carters are planning a modest celebration of the milestone event. They have invited several hundred relatives and friends to join them this weekend for a party in the auditorium of Plains High School. They are looking forward to meeting a 3-year-old great-granddaughter whom they have never seen because of the pandemic. Ahead of the anniversary the Carters gave joint interviews to several news outlets including The Associated Press and The New York Times. “It’s a full partnership” Jimmy Carter told  the AP.  “My biggest secret is to marry the right person if you want to have a long-lasting marriage” Carter said.   The nonagenarian couple offered a few other tips for a long-lasting marriage. From the AP story: “Every day there needs to be reconciliation and communication between the two spouses” the former president said explaining that he and Rosalynn both devout Christians read the Bible together aloud each night — something they’ve done for years even when separated by their travels. “We don’t go to sleep with some remaining differences between us” he said. Rosalynn Carter noted the importance of finding common interests. Even now she said “Jimmy and I are always looking for things to do together.” Still she emphasized a caveat: “Each (person) should have some space. That’s really important.” Their marriage faced an early road bump when Carter abruptly cut short a promising Navy career to return to Plains and take over the family peanut warehouse business after his father James Early Carter Sr. became ill and died in 1953. He didn’t consult his wife about the decision and she was upset about giving up the life of a globe-trotting Navy wife. But she said the move ended up strengthening their partnership. They raised three sons and a daughter together. “We developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics” Rosalynn Carter told AP. “I knew more on paper about the business than he did. He would take my advice about things” she added drawing a laugh and affirmation from her husband. Carter also didn’t consult his wife when he decided to get into politics in a 1962 race for a seat in the  Georgia State Senate. But she developed a love for politics and campaigning. Their partnership has endured as the traditional  marriage vows state “for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part.”  As first lady Rosalynn Carter not only supported her husband but established her own East Wing office contributing on key legislation dealing with health care and mental health. She became one of his closest advisers and sat in on some Cabinet meetings. There was the triumphant election victory over President Gerald Ford in 1976 followed  by the devastating loss to Ronald Reagan four years later. Together they faced the challenge of returning to Plains in 1981. First they had to work to revive the family business which was heavily in debt and then they went on to forge one of the most successful post-presidencies in U.S. history. The couple founded The Carter Center dedicated to promoting free democratic elections health initiatives for the poor and women’s equality. They worked together helping Habitat for Humanity  build homes for the poor around the world. In 2002 Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize “for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts to advance democracy and human rights and to promote economic and social development.” Jimmy Carter’s religious views also evolved. He left the Southern Baptist Convention in 2006 denouncing views that he felt “subjugated” women at home and in the church. He also came to support same-sex marriage. The couple has had their share of health problems in recent years. Jimmy Carter finally had to give up teaching Sunday school classes at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains handing the duties over to his niece. But the Carters told The New York Times that they have only grown closer and share everything as they’ve aged together.   “I know for my sake” Carter said “it’s been the best thing I’ve ever had happen to me — marrying Rosalynn and living together for so long growing to know each other more and more intimately every day in married life.” His hand drifted over to hers. “I’ve been very happy” he said letting out a little laugh “and I love her more now than I did to begin with — which is saying a lot because I loved her a lot.”  And thanks to the comment by  FoundingFatherDAR I’m adding a link to the Carters’ interview with PBS’ Judy Woodruff to the diary.
