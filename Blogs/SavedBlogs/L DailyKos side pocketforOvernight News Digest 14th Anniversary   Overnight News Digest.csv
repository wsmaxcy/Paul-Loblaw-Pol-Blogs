Since 2007 the OND has been a regular community feature on Daily Kos consisting of news stories from around the world sometimes coupled with a daily theme original research or commentary. Editors of OND impart their own presentation styles and content choices typically publishing each day near 12:00 AM Eastern Time.   We use sources from all over the world with a focus on timeliness and accuracy. On Fridays there is often news from the art world and Saturdays the news is from the world of science. Stories provide a link to the original source plus a paragraph or two from the source.  We are sometimes stymied by paywalls which can limit our access but editors have found work-arounds such that as much news as possible is presented. Commenters are a valuable resource and add welcome stories and links that might otherwise be missed. Many of the regular commenters are based worldwide and add information from their part of the globe. In light of different time zones it’s often good to check OND the following morning to see what’s been added. If you are a regular reader thank you for your support. If OND is new to you check it out and spread the word.
