L, The First and Worst Hurt by the Heat, DButch, 2021-07-05, Today’s Seattle Times written by ST columnist Naomi Ishisaka has an article about “the inequality of heat” — another large chunk of proof that the past isn’t past — it’s prologue.  And if the past includes a lot of racism and discrimination generally against race (and economic status although this article focuses on race — where discrimination pretty reliably ALSO creates economic disadvantage — two for the price of one) the people who suffered in the past ARE ALSO the ones who are going to suffer in the future.  Which happens to be RIGHT NOW in the climate change driven heat wave we’ve been and are experiencing. She refers to research published in Nature Communications (I think this may be one of the articles referred to in the ST article — there are a couple of others.) where they found that people of color are disproportionately exposed to urban heat.  Lots of concrete (and asphalt — let’s not forget that) and few trees and shade create “heat islands”. The researchers found that in nearly all urban areas the average person of color regardless of income — lived in an area with higher heat island intensity. This wasn’t a matter of a few degrees here in our local area either.  In Seattle and King County local research found that the difference between hotter and cooler areas in Seattle (I assume since King County was involved they are talking Seattle Metropolitan area — since we lived there and both Seattle and a lot of areas in the whole area have significant differences in amount of shade between areas by economic state) could differ by up to 23 degrees in different areas taken at the same time: ...due to disparities such as tree canopies and location of industrial areas (Note — I read an article a week or so ago — air temperature may seriously understate ground temperature.  We now have satellites in orbit that can accurately measure actual surface temperatures — which can be 20-50 degrees HIGHER than the air temperature.  And this is heat storing up to make the nights miserable too.  Phoenix was a forerunner — it was experiencing this in the 70s. ) The areas with the hottest heat islands are unsurprisingly where PoC are concentrated and also happen to correlate with high levels of other environmental health disparities.  The connection between past discrimination and current distress is blazingly (to use an obvious term) obvious: Many of these disparities can be traced back to the legacy of housing segregation neighborhood redlining and environmental racism such as placing polluting businesses in communities of color. One study found that formerly redlined neighborhoods in nearly every city were hotter than those that were not redlined according to NPR. Consequently Scientific American reported that extreme heat and air pollution are a leading cause of death for communities of color. If you want to do a bit of research on your own area the article has a pointer to treeequityscore.org which maps the tree canopies (or lack) of a lot of areas.  For example the NYT reported that affluent areas had nearly 50% more greenery than poor areas. The rest of the article talks about over 30 years of climate change denialists trying to “muddy the waters” about human contributions to rising temperatures while trying to avoid doing anything about ACTUAL rising temperatures.  The tRump administration made things worse over its four years by rolling back rules and policies aimed at attacking the problem.
