L, Before Anyone thinks of building Barr a Pedestal to Stand on ..., jamess, 2021-06-28, — Even though former AG Bill Barr may have inadvertently just told the truth to a reporter — AFTER THE FACT — that doesn’t absolve him from his involvement in the Election Heist attempt — AS IT WAS GOING ON …     APNews.com — Nov 9 2020 Attorney General William Barr has authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities if they exist before the 2020 presidential election is certified despite no evidence of widespread fraud. [...] In a memo to U.S. attorneys obtained by The Associated Press Barr wrote that investigations “may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that if true could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.” He said any allegations that would “clearly not impact the outcome of a federal election” should be delayed until after those elections are certified and prosecutors should likely open so-called preliminary inquiries which would allow investigators and prosecutors to see if there is evidence that would allow them to take further investigative measures. Barr does not identify any specific instances of purported fraud in the memo. [...] Why this pro-active Investigations edict is a flashing-light indicator of Barr’s “Minority Report” culpability is perhaps best explained by this following report: ProPublica.org — Oct. 7 2020 The Department of Justice has weakened its long-standing prohibition against interfering in elections according to two department officials. Avoiding election interference is the overarching principle of DOJ policy on voting-related crimes. In place since at least 1980 the policy generally bars prosecutors not only from making any announcement about ongoing investigations close to an election but also from taking public steps — such as an arrest or a raid — before a vote is finalized because the publicity could tip the balance of a race. But according to an email sent Friday by an official in the Public Integrity Section in Washington now if a U.S. attorney’s office suspects election fraud that involves postal workers or military employees federal investigators will be allowed to take public investigative steps before the polls close even if those actions risk affecting the outcome of the election. [...] Specifically citing postal workers and military employees is noteworthy former DOJ officials said. But the exception is written so broadly that it could cover other types of investigations as well they said. Both groups have been falsely singled out in different ways by President Donald Trump and his campaign for being involved in voter fraud. Trump has repeatedly attempted to delegitimize ballots sent through the postal service just as the country experiences increased voting by mail spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. He has also raised the specter that the ballots of military members among whom he enjoys broad support might be suppressed. [...] Trump wanted to overturn the Election by any means possible — the evidence be damned.  Bill Barr took proactive steps to drum up that evidence even if by so doing he was ‘just placating the boss’ — as he disingenuously claims now. Judging an Election to be “possibly” fraudulent before ballots are even counted smacks of conviction BEFORE crimes are even committed (ala the “Minority Report” sci-fi tale). At minimum Barr upped the angst and the anger in the Trump base who were looking for any shred of rationale to justify their clandestine preparations for their 1-6 Election Heist attempt.  So much for the DOJ policy of “avoiding election interference” … that could ignite “the publicity could tip the balance of a race” — or its subsequent Nullification efforts. Bill Barr saw to it that those “prohibitions” were thrown out the DOJ window — all because the Boss wanted a scandal any scandal — any rhetorical cudgel he could use to “tip the balance of power” back into his loser direction.      The fact that Barr is calling it all “Bullshit” NOW — does not erase his complicity in that “Bullshit Story” — BACK WHEN calling it out for what it was COULD HAVE made a real difference to the Insurrection Events about to unfold. Barr deserves no medals for courage or integrity or truth-telling.  No way.  That die was cast when he single-handedly rewrote and dismissed the Mueller Report — BACK WHEN that could have made a real difference too.  Once again because that’s ‘what the Boss wanted’.  The People’s AG — Bill Barr definitely was not. Trump didn’t call him “Roy” for nothing. — — . . . . .
