L, Cryptocurrencies: What are they good for?  Absolutely nothing?, zman1527, 2021-04-27, I hope that there are some folks here who can explain to me and others what cryptocurrencies are good for.  I have a modest understanding of them but not a great understanding.  But I don’t understand what use they have other than as crazy speculative instruments or to hide illegal transactions.  On a practical level why should I put money into a crypto instead of a bank?  Other than as a highly speculative investment? The volatility of the cryptos up and down 20% or 30% or more in a day or a week seems to limit their value as an actual currency.  How can you make a budget if you don’t know within those limits what your money will be worth in the next little while?  If I go to buy something on Ebay do I have $100 worth of Dogecoin or $80 or $125?  Don’t our current currencies and credit cards etc work reasonably well? They also seem to me to be very unsafe.  Anything that is totally unregulated and only relies on hackable bits and bytes that can disappear in the flip of switch or the tap of keystroke does not fill me with confidence. And does the value (?) they provide make up for the tremendous amount of energy it takes to create them?  I have read that it takes something  like the energy used by 20 households for a month to create a new bitcoin.  WTF?  Is that a wise use of energy and the attendant pollution?   I have posed this question before on investment chat boards.  The only response that I have gotten about the inherent value of cryptos is “That you don’t understand freedom.”  Hopefully someone can clue me in as to what I am missing.    So cryptocurrencies what are they good for?
