L, Photo Diary: Dolphins !!!, Lenny FlankforShutterbugs, 2021-04-25, It’s not a rare thing to see Dolphins swimming out in Tampa Bay but every time I do I still stop to watch. A few photos. (Dolphins are VERY hard to photo—they only surface for a couple seconds and you never know where.) For those who don't know I lived in a converted campervan and traveled around the country posting photo diaries of places that I visited. But the pandemic has clipped my wings and I am now holed up in Florida until I can begin traveling again. :)
