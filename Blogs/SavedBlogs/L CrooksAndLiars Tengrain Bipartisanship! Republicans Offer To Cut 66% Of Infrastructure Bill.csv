L, Bipartisanship! Republicans Offer To Cut 66% Of Infrastructure Bill, Tengrain, 2021-04-05, In case anyone was wondering what bipartisanship from the Coup Klux Klan looks like aptly-named Sen. Blunt (R-Possum Hollar) tells us:  “I think there’s an easy win here for the White House if they would take that win which is make this an infrastructure package  which is about 30 percent even if you stretch the definition of  infrastructure some it’s about 30 percent of the $2.25 trillion we are  talking about spending” he said. “We’ll keep ⅓ what the hell do you people want?” he didn’t add.  Got that? If the Dims would just give Team Evil 70% of the decision making you know all would be well.  We just had four years of Infrastructure Week without any  infrastructure at all being proposed of build (unless you consider Hair  Füror’s Last Monument to the Confederacy at the southern border to be  infrastructure) the demand to get rid of most of a bill that is hugely  popular is their idea of bipartisanship.
