C, The Cancel Culture is Marxism in Action, Daniel Bobinski, 2020-11-24, As soon as Leftists believed that Joe Biden won the presidency they tipped their hand showing us their true nature. Cancel all conservatives! Prevent them from getting jobs! Despite all the talk about unity people like Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Eastern Libtardia) began talking about making lists. Yes the woman who’s prior career required her to earn money by making a Duck Fart (look it up) now thinks that anyone who voted for or supported Donald Trump is unworthy to be considered a respected member of society. Think like a Soviet much AOC? Isn’t it interesting that Leftists said Trump was the fascist?  Let’s help these linear-thinking Marxists by providing them the dictionary definition of Fascism as they’re seemingly uncapable of looking it up themselves: “A centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition” (emphasis added) Let’s review those last few words: “Forcible suppression of opposition.” If Ms. Ruben and Ms. Occasional Cortex can’t see that they themselves are acting in a true fascist manner we need to assign them the same disability as Stevie Wonder.  (Sorry Stevie.) Dozens more leftists / Marxists / Democrats (all synonyms) also pounded the drum for anyone affiliated with Donald Trump to be “cancelled” from society. A website called trumpaccountability.net was started with a not-so-American purpose: “The Trump Accountability Project was started because we believe restoring democratic norms are vital to protecting America’s future. A critical part of making sure the nation never finds itself in this position again is to make sure those members of the Trump administration responsible for loosening the guardrails of our democracy are not rewarded with book deals TV contracts or six-figure salaries in the private sector based on that experience.” That sounds American don’t you think? The website now says “[I]n the spirit of the President-elect’s call to build a more united country this project will no longer be active.” First for clarification Joe Biden is not the President-elect but overall I call BS. I don’t think they shut this down for “unity.” I think they realized this coordinated attack against Americans was not playing well with the electorate on both sides of the aisle. But what’s interesting to note is the sentence that reads “the goal of the project was to play a part in restoring the soul of the nation.” Really? Cancelling people out of society for their political views is an American ethic? Doing so would restore a Marxist’s soul but not the American soul. It’d be nice if these folks would see that their actions align with the definition of Fascism (see above) but I fear their consciences have become so seared their “self-awareness” eyes are also blind. We know that several ways exist for Donald Trump to retain his seat in the Oval Office for the next four years and I’m convinced that one of those will play out. That means the fictitious “Office of the President-Elect” will need to be vacated (will security escort Joe out while he carries his belongings in a cardboard box?) and all the Deep State players that Joe chose from his Facebook list to fill different positions will have little blue marbles falling out their backsides. From there it’s fair bet that the massive corruption that took place over the last year will get exposed and many names large and small will be doing the perp walk. That is if Attorney General William Barr decides to do his job. If he can’t perhaps Sidney Powell would be a good replacement. Thankfully Trump staying in the White House also means that the TRUE Fascists – the Leftists / Marxists / Democrats – will not be able to implement their Soviet practices of cancelling people simply because of their support for Donald Trump. At least not yet. By the time Trump is serving his second term I believe this time of uncharted waters will have been a blessing for all Americans for they will have become aware of what the Leftists / Marxists / Democrats would do to our society. But like I said it’s a “not yet.” I’m also of the belief that the Leftists / Marxists / Democrats in America will implode in 2021 from the weight of their corruption but that gives them three years to rebuild and try their Marxist tactics again in 2024. Hopefully Americans will remember.  Hopefully.
