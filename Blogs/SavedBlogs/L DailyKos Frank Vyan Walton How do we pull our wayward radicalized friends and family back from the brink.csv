L, How do we pull our wayward radicalized friends and family back from the brink?, Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-05-11, As I’ve written before essentially half of the voting electorate has functionally gone insane.  They still think Donald Trump is the rightful White House resident.  They think some massive fraud took place during the 2020 election.  They think that Democrats are a radical pack of terrorist who wish to tear apart our cities with protests over the “non-problem" of isolated incidents of police violence against people of color.  They think that CoronaVirus is a massive hoax that a half-million Americans actually died of “natural causes” instead of a deadly virus because Doctors "make more money” when they blame Covid they think masks are an affront to their freedom they think that shutdowns are intended to destroy the country they think that the vaccine is poison and/or a massive tracking program intended to spy on them and they believe that the January 6th attack on the Capitol was merely a "love fest” not a violent insurrection against our Democracy. Rep. Liz Cheney who refuses to buy into any of this malarkey is essentially being “canceled" as a member of House leadership tomorrow.  Any GOPer who bucks this narrative is finding themselves marginalized and purged because Trump and his base are ALL IN on the big delusion. The underlying question is — what is it that the rest of us can do about this? Is it possible that those who have fallen so far down the rabbit hole can be pulled back out? Perhaps. Some of this is part of cognitive dysfunction and there may be limited options. Most people don’t follow politics all that closely they aren't reading the Wall Street Journal New York Times or Washington Post — they're reading Facebook.  They're reading information generated by questionable actors amateur “journalists” who have a clear ideological agenda or right-wing media which also has an ideological agenda. Partisan identity has become a powerful motivating force for many people particularly if they are emotionally vulnerable or happen to be in isolated circumstances.  Considering the isolation fostered by the spread of Covid over the past year this potential has grown exponentially. Fortunately there are some resources that concerned friends and family of the radicalized can turn to.  Germany has long-established programs and services to help battle radicalization however there are some similar services now available in the U.S. Koehler said that Germany has a structure that approaches the problem in different ways depending on the facts of the situation. One family may only want help finding a counselor another depending on the severity of the threat may require witness protection. The country has regional outreach offices that provide help to people who are afraid that family members are being radicalized and may be mobilizing to commit an act of violence. “Ideally you’d have a helpline hotline or any other central place where parents teachers social workers can address concerns counseling case assessment” Koehler said describing deradicalization and prevention of violent extremism as more of an “art” than a science. “If it’s really a concerning case then they get referred to a local service provider to help mitigate the risk and bring people undergoing radicalization away from that process.” Very few organizations in the U.S. offer these kinds of services though experts say that family-based interventions are often the only effective route to reach people who may commit an act of extremist violence before they do so. The groups that do tend to be underfunded and understaffed. Parents for Peace a mostly volunteer-run group co-founded by a man whose son radicalized and killed a soldier offers a national hotline to help yank people away from extremism. The group has said that calls to the line tripled after Jan. 6. In Colorado the state funds a hotline called Safe2Tell which aims to provide people with “a safe anonymous way to help someone who is struggling or hurting.” How people gradually fall into these cultish groups can be a key factor to helping them back out of them. “It was belonging finding a group of people that share the same ideas with you” she said. But whether a person radicalizes based off a grievance in their own life or whether the ideology itself pushes them towards violence can remain a chicken-or-egg problem. It’s only in recent years that prevention of violent extremism has been considered possible. DHS has spurred that recognition in part through an as-of-yet small grant program offering $20 million for the coming year aimed at funding programs to prevent terrorist violence. Advocates of preventative approaches to violent extremism argue that family members are uniquely positioned to identify both when someone is going off the rails and potentially address any underlying problem that’s contributing to the issue. The idea is that for people who are lonely or suffering from personal problems family frequently remains the only way to break past the worldview and sense of community that far-right extremist groups can provide for their members. “Without face to face social discourse we tend to go to more mean extreme places” Nielsen said. “So you take someone who is already in a bad place you give them voice a rationale have people cheering them on and tell them they’re part of something bigger than themselves.” Hughes the American University researcher said that bringing people back tends to be most successful early on in the radicalization process and almost always via family members who can effectively compete with the sense of belonging that radical groups provide. “The therapeutic emotional approaches tend to be the most effective” Hughes said. Radicalization is a slippery slope.  It has many layers and many elements. Bringing someone back from a radical outlook is a delicate process that needs to be largely implemented by people they trust and love. With the help of trained counselors it is possible to turn someone around if you essentially have their trust. They aren't all lost to us and lost to reason forever. But we gonna need a lot more counselors. Stat.  A Capitol Rioter has written a letter from detention that brags that the incarcerated have all “bonded” while in Jail and says that if they really wanted to - they could have overthrown the government. [So what was Jan 6th a dress rehearsal?] In a letter sent from behind bars a key defendant in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol said he and fellow inmates have bonded in jail and boasted that those attacking the building could have overthrown the government if they had wanted. The letter is signed “the 1/6ers" and expresses no remorse for the assault on the Capitol in which five people died. While no names appeared on it ProPublica was able to determine through interviews with his family and a review of his correspondence from jail that it was penned by Guy Reffitt a member of the Three Percenter right-wing militant group accused of participating in the riot. The letter said the inmates arrested for their role in the attack regularly recite the Pledge of Allegiance inside the Washington D.C. jail and sing the national anthem “all in unison loud and proud most everyday." “January 6th was nothing short of a satirical way to overthrow a government" said the letter written by hand on yellow lined paper. “If overthrow was the quest it would have no doubt been overthrown." Is there a way back for this guy?  I don't know but it looks like it would be a very rocky road. As has been pointed out in the comments scaling up this deprogramming solution is difficult.  it seems that many of their fellow Republicans Liz Cheney Joe Walsh Olivia Troye and the Lincoln Project members who have been “Never Trumpers” are not effective at reaching through the fog and pulling people out.  What I suppose they would need is a support group of ex-MAGAs. A form of MAGAs Anonymous — where they can share stories as to why they were attracted to Trump and his policies in the first place and also why and how they gradually shifted away. I think it’s only with people they have a shared experience with —people who understand them — that improvements can be made.  It’s not like that would come out of it as Liberals or Democrats I would expect them to still be Conservatives and Republicans — just not quite so filled with grievance and unable to make reasonable cognitive decisions.
