L, Despite Court Order Mark McCloskey Shows Off A New Gun, Chris capper Li..., 2021-06-21, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  On Thursday as part of a plea agreement Mark McCloskey just entered guilty pleas to numerous misdemeanors to the gun-waving incident last year and had to pay thousands of dollars in fines and having to give up the gun he had brandished at peaceful racial justice protesters.  On Saturday he tweeted pictures of himself holding the new AR that he had just purchased: Checking out my new AR! #2A #MOSen pic.twitter.com/Qa5UKupXSX — Mark McCloskey (@mccloskeyusa) June 19 2021 But wait there's more. There's always more. After entering the guilty pleas he stood on the courthouse steps and tried to turn it into a campaign stunt in his race for US Senate: As the Post-Dispatch’s Joel Currier reported Thursday Mark McCloskey was anything but contrite after the plea. “The prosecutor dropped every charge except for alleging that I purposely placed other people in imminent risk of physical injury right and I sure as heck did” McCloskey said on the courthouse steps. “That’s what the guns were there for and I’d do it again any time the mob approaches me. … If that’s a crime in Missouri by God I did it and I’d do it again.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also editorialized the the guilty pleas and ad hoc campaign stunt were more than enough grounds disbarment.  I couldn't agree more. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
