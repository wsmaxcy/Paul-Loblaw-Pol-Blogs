L, Insomniacs' Vent Hole: Take My Country Back, Al DoradoforInsomniacs Vent Hole with James Corden, 2021-07-01,  Yet as I've grown older I've mellowed into another valuable relationship with the work of certain artists. These are the ones I follow over time and refuse to abandon no matter what damage Twitter is doing to my attention span. They're my lifers: the creative spirits who helped me nurture my own spark as a kid and then continued to mirror my pathway sometimes in the background but always generating a certain sense of recognition. Walter Salas-Humara is a guy like that for me. He's led bands under the name The Silos since 1985; I discovered him around 1989 when my future husband played me the band's second album Cuba. I couldn't stop listening to it and to the other stuff he'd recorded at that point: another Silos album the solo outing Lagartija stuff from the Silos' sister band the Vulgar Boatmen. I loved the sound of the music. It's rootsy and ragged and very attuned to the thrift-store ethic that defined my life by then – the idea that no idea or practice can be exactly new but it will be renewed through the act of absorbing and reimagining it. And then there was Walter's songwriting: lyrical and romantic but always turned a little wry and a little sad by the outsider's sensibility rooted in his youth as the son of Cuban exiles growing up in Florida. — Ann Powers NPR . ‘I’m Over You’ (1990) .
