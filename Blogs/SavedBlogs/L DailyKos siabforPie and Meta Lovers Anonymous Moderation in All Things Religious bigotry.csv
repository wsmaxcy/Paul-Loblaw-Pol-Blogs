L, Moderation in All Things: Religious bigotry, siabforPie and Meta Lovers Anonymous, 2021-05-04, For a pretty good discussion on this topic and the cause for the tip of the hat in the image caption start here. The Rules of the Road That means that whether you are Unitarian Universalist Roman Catholic Russian Orthodox Muslim a member of the Church of All Worlds or the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (The Pastafarians); an atheist an agnostic a pan-pagan or something that fits no particular description but matters to you you don’t get to put down anybody else because of their belief or opinion in this area. That does not mean you cannot logically outline the problems you perceive in a particular faith or congregation or that you cannot advocate for the position of the inherent absence of any entity that might be called a god. It does mean that if you use those positions to broadly smear a particular belief or its followers or to come to conclusions about an individual because of their proximity to that belief you are likely to be gently or not so gently corrected. In other words guys using “Sky Fairies” to put down a religion is way out of bounds. Using membership or belief in a religion to put someone down is a bad idea generally. Using a derogatory word for a religion or branch of a  religion doesn’t work too well either. The conjugation “I am a member of an established religion. You are a heretic. He is a cultist”  works from the standpoint of any religion. If anyone has missed Emo Phillips on the multiple schisms of the Baptist church — well I don’t recommend it as light comedy but I always think of it when the subject comes up. “Christianity” is not monolithic; neither usually are any of its offshoots that have grown past any single congregation. Today “Evangelical” is a hot button but it’s also a catch-all term for any proselytizing faith and deliberately(?) misused by some movements within that category to inflate their numbers. It is also being regularly misused on Daily Kos currently to imply that it is synonymous with “Trump followers.” This may not be intentional bigotry but it is bigotry nonetheless. Personally I’m about as ready to accept someone on Daily Kos trying to convince me to follow their particular God or lack thereof as I would  be to have the reincarnated Ronald Reagan here trying to convince me to back trickle-down economics. It’s why I have a particular level of animus toward people who call themselves atheists but who cannot stand it that there are people in the world who do not agree with them. Talk about being bigoted toward all religions… Your common or garden atheist is no problem here. A lack of belief in something does not usually translate into anything but an interesting discussion. On the other hand I’m having trouble remembering when the last time was before this weekend that someone posted a comment effectively beginning with “First kill all the Christians.” (It was an interesting comment in that it only had room for a single division; Christians and atheists. Other possibilities weren’t even given a passing nod.) If you find yourself similarly tempted you might want to find another place to write it. If the idea of an organized religion seems silly to you that’s perfectly fine. (Personally I very much enjoy some of the more disorganized ones. I had a friend who decided at one point that her Goddess was named Caprice. Sounded good to me…) You can even mention it in passing or write a comment or diary about it. As long as you don’t try to justify or prove your thesis in order to put someone down or make an assumption about their morality you might even get away with it. Lastly one set of tangentially related terms that it may not ever have occurred to you to include in this discussion. It’s worthwhile at least to consider the basis and origins for Moral and Morality Good and Evil Wicked and a few others in that general area as used to define or judge actions motivations intentions or general character. You should be aware at least that for many people those terms are used primarily in a religious context though many of the links are unconscious. To use them in describing people or their actions carries the implication that your readers are or should be comfortable with a particular theological basis usually Christian Judeo-Christian or Abrahamic for judging people and their actions. You may wish to consider whether these are indeed the standards you wish to use considering the multiplicity of beliefs followed by the people likely to be reading your work. I’ve shut down membership in Community Moderation group (we had a wonderful month!); the Archive remains and I’d appreciate it if people would message me with links to new diaries that you think might belong there. I’ve got a pretty fair list of interesting items that came up waiting to be written about and I’m open to more suggestions so I expect to be doing these at least once a week for some time to come. Tuesdays still look like a good time. ;) Comments are open. Thank you all. I am not on the Daily Kos Staff; I have no official position. I do not speak for the Help Desk and just about everything in these except for direct quotes from the Rules of the Road is my personal opinion. Some of it I can back up with numbers some is pure guesswork and some of it is pulled straight out of thin air (or something) because it seemed to make a reasonable argument at the time.
