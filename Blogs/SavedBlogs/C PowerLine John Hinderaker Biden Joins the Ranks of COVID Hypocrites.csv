C, Biden Joins the Ranks of COVID Hypocrites, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-21, Yesterday Joe Biden signed a number of executive orders including one requiring mask wearing on federal grounds. Yesterday he also was filmed on federal grounds not wearing a mask along with various member of his family. To my surprise a reporter actually asked Biden’s Press Secretary the inept Jen Psaki about the contradiction. She was out of ammo: WATCH: When asked why Biden broke his own mask rules yesterday his Press Sec said "He was celebrating a historic day in our country… We have bigger things to worry about." pic.twitter.com/Kv4tJnZTnz — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) January 21 2021  
So Biden can do whatever he wants since he has “bigger things to worry about.” At this point no one expects Democrats to follow their own rules. And Mr. Reporter are you a traitor to your class or what? Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
