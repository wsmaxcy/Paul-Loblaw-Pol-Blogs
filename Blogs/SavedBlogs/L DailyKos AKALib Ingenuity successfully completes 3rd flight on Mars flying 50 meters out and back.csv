L, Ingenuity successfully completes 3rd flight on Mars flying 50 meters out and back, AKALib, 2021-04-25, The Mars helicopter Ingenuity is set to make its 3rd test flight today Sunday April 25. Data should arrive shortly after 10:16 a.m. EDT at mission control at JPL. In this test NASA plans to increase the max airspeed from 0.5 meters per second to 2 meters per second (about 4.5 mph) head 50 meters north and return to land at Wright Brothers Field. Total flight time will be about 80 seconds and the total distance traveled will be about 100 meters. A reminder that all this will occur in the tenuous atmosphere low gravity and low temperatures of Mars. Faster farther bolder. #MarsHelicopter is set for flight No. 3 on April 25. https://t.co/1wUTLiBm7d  Flight plan:Speed: ~4.5mphRange: 330ft (100m) roundtripAltitude: 16ft (5m)Data expected later Sunday. Til then peep this shot of rover tracks from the 2nd flight. pic.twitter.com/0qjtWC3jCz Updates Third flight in the history books✅Our #MarsHelicopter continues to set records flying faster and farther. The space chopper is demonstrating critical capabilities that could enable the addition of an aerial dimension to future missions to Mars & beyond. https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE pic.twitter.com/Uaxrr23Rfh The image in the tweet is from today’s flight. More details to come. You can check out the latest images at mars.nasa.gov/… Here is the latest update from mars.nasa.gov/… NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter continues to set records flying faster and farther on Sunday April 25 2021 than in any tests it went through on Earth. The helicopter took off at 1:31 a.m. EDT (4:31 a.m. PDT) or 12:33 p.m. local Mars time rising 16 feet (5 meters) – the same altitude as its second flight. Then it zipped downrange 164 feet (50 meters) almost half the length of a football field reaching a top speed of 6.6 feet per second (2 meters per second). This was also a test of Ingenuity’s navigation capabilities using its onboard camera. Lateral movement beyond 0.5 meters had not been exercised in tests conducted in vacuum chambers at JPL. And here is the much-awaited video of Ingenuity moving from left to right out of the camera frame and then back again maintaining constant altitude. You can also watch it on YouTube. Far Out 🚁For this third flight the #MarsHelicopter traveled almost half the length of a football field and increased its airspeed to 4.5 mph (2 m/sec). Until now Ingenuity had not flown at this speed even while testing on Earth. https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE pic.twitter.com/S65oIeQ4BC First Flight The first test flight took place early morning on Monday April 19 when Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of 3 meters and maintained a stable hover for 30 seconds. It then descended touching back down on the surface of Mars after logging a total of 39.1 seconds of flight. Here is the video of the first flight from Perseverance stationed 64.3 meters away at Van Zyl Overlook. Witness the historic moment in full. The Mastcam-Z cameras on @NASAPersevere show us the takeoff hovering and landing of the #MarsHelicopter. pic.twitter.com/ypdIWmC4D1 Second Flight During the second flight on Thursday April 22 Ingenuity autonomously climbed to 5 meters in height traveled 2 meters to the east and back and remained airborne 51.9 seconds. It also made three turns totaling about 276 degrees. The #MarsHelicopter faced new challenges in its second flight and reached each milestone. https://t.co/L18F2NCeaZIt achieved:✅ 51.9-second flight time✅ 16-foot altitude (5 meters)✅ 5˚ tilt to accelerate sideways ~7 feet (2 meters) pic.twitter.com/9yMsRLhbcl The image below is the first color image of the Martian surface taken by an aerial vehicle while it was aloft. The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter captured it with its color camera during its second successful flight test on April 22 2021. At the time this image Ingenuity was 5.2 meters above the surface and pitching (moving the camera’s field of view upward) so the helicopter could begin its 2-meter translation to the west – away from the rover. The image as well as the inset showing a closeup of a portion of the tracks the Perseverance Mars rover and Mars surface features demonstrates the utility of scouting Martian terrain from an aerial perspective. www.nasa.gov/... Weather in Jezero crater on April 23 — High: -25°C Low: -82°C. Why Mars Helicopter? Why are these flights such a big deal? Aside from operating under extreme cold conditions on a planet 50 million km away Ingenuity has to operate in an atmosphere whose surface pressure is about 0.65% that on earth. On earth pressure drops to about 4% at an altitude of 20 km (about 65616 feet). No drone or rotorcraft on earth has every flown at 20 km altitude let alone at a pressure of 0.65% atmospheres. These tests will pave the way for airborne robots in future solar system exploration missions which will help extend the reach of these missions and may also assist humans when they land on Mars. About the Ingenuity Helicopter NASA’s Mars Helicopter Ingenuity is the first to demonstrate powered flight on another world. It is a technology demonstration and assessment experiment and is not critical to the primary mission. It will provide a scouting service for Perseverance by surveying the area around the rover flying in the thin atmosphere and low gravity of Mars. The one-way signal travel time between Mars and Earth is around 16 minutes and 26 seconds (on April 25) so real-time remote piloting of the helicopter is out of question. Flight plans are uploaded by controllers at JPL which Ingenuity uses to autonomously control its flight. Used to communicate with the Perseverance rover Radio link using low-power Zigbee communication protocol 250 kbit/s over distances of up to 1000 m. Solar tracker camera and visual inertial navigation system The inconsistent Mars magnetic field precludes the use of a compass  What next for Ingenuity? From www.space.com/… - The Ingenuity team hopes to fly two more times before the flight window closes in early May. And these last two sorties will likely be "really adventurous" Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung also of JPL said during a news conference earlier this month stressing that she and her colleagues want to push the little aircraft's limits. That will be it for Ingenuity. There's no negotiating a longer flight window because Perseverance needs to start focusing on its own science mission soon. Perseverance NASA’s Mars 2020 spacecraft and the Perseverance Rover arrived at Mars on Feb 18. The Perseverance rover successfully landed in Jezero Crater a large impact crater about 45 km wide just north of the Martian equator. Jezero once contained a lake which scientists think is one of the most ideal places to find evidence of ancient microbial life the primary objective of this mission.  The rover will also collect and store rock and regolith samples which will be returned to Earth in a future mission for further analysis. Check out diary “The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover and the Search for Life” for more info about the mission. While all eyes have been on Ingenuity lately Perseverance has been busy testing its instruments conducting experiments supporting Ingenuity and getting ready for its search-for-ancient-microbial-life trip ahead in Jezero crater. This week MOXIE the Mars Oxygen generator was fired up and it generated about 5.4 grams of Oxygen in an hour by breaking up Mars CO2 into CO and O2 . This is equivalent to about 10 minutes’ worth of breathable Oxygen for an astronaut. MOXIE is capable of producing up to 10 grams an hour. The equipment will be tested in 9 more runs over the next 2 years to systematically evaluate its performance under varying conditions. Another huge first: converting CO2 into oxygen on Mars. Working off the land with what’s already here my MOXIE instrument has shown it can be done! Future explorers will need to generate oxygen for rocket fuel and for breathing on the Red Planet. https://t.co/9sjZT9KeOR To learn more about how MOXIE extracts O2 from CO2 check out en.wikipedia.org/… and link.springer.com/… and take a look at the diagrams below.  The Future of Flight To be clear these test flights are the first small steps in flying on another world. In the coming weeks Ingenuity will fly two more times in its 30-day test campaign. If will perform similar sorties as was done today and perhaps go more adventurous. Future missions will probably include flying drones which greatly expand the capability of exploring and studying Mars. And other planets and moons. NASA already has plans to send a flying drone to Saturn’s moon Titan. Dragonfly will launch in 2026 and arrive in 2034. Hopefully one day humankind will fly around Mars and other planets and moons routinely. Epilogue Three cheers to Perseverance and Ingenuity — we need more of them in our lives. Let us be inspired to Dare Mighty Things. Further Reading
