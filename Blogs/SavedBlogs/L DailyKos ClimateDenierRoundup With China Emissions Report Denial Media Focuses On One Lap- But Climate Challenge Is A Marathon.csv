L, With China Emissions Report Denial Media Focuses On One Lap- But Climate Challenge Is A Marathon, ClimateDenierRoundup, 2021-05-10, Imagine tuning into a race and seeing a still-fresh-looking runner overtake a group of runners who are feeling the effects of the exertion that put them into the lead. You cheer for the underdog-turned-leader of the pack and immediately begin talking trash about how the rest of the tired looking racers should just give up. "It’s all over" you taunt.  "Time to throw in the towel."  Then the announcer points out that your newest idol is actually 4 laps behind that whole pack of other racers who courteously let the actually-quite-behind runner pass them as a show of good sportsmanship for the laggard. That would be pretty darn embarrassing right?   Right. So keep that scenario in mind because last week the researchers at Rhodium released a report showing that in 2019 China’s greenhouse gas emissions were a quarter of the global total and an amount greater than that of the rich countries combined. Conservative outlets like the New York Post Breitbart and Town Hall were happy enough to run with the narrative that “communist” China is the leading polluter in the world.   Only the Washington Examiner even hinted to its audience that there was more to the picture with Josh Siegal’s story mentioning in its last sentence that “Despite China’s huge emissions growth the U.S. which industrialized before China has contributed the most cumulative emissions of any country.”  Oh well what do you know maybe there’s more than one lap in this race and China’s acceleration past OECD countries isn’t quite the lead it may look at first! Yes it’s zooming at quite an alarming rate pushed by a brutally authoritarian central government and at the expense of human rights and local and international environmental concerns.  But it turns out all those rich countries have lowered their own emissions in part by outsourcing polluting industry to China and keeping the profits and together have put four times as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.  And since climate change is caused by the cumulative emissions and not just the latest yearly contribution — the most recent lap of a long race so to speak — China's 2019 emissions in no way justifies jingoistic claims that the U.S. can sluff off its historic responsibility to clean up pollution that it still has produced more of than any other nation in the world. Yes one of the few things the United States is actually #1 in is having polluted the air the planet’s life relies on for survival.  So keep an eye on deniers who are hoping you’ve just tuned in so you’ll buy it when they blame a country that would need to quadruple its output just to catch and use it as an excuse to quit trying all together.  Just like Stephen Miller jumping into the last lap of a high school girls track race to prove that men are athletically superior to women absolutely does not prove that China's greenhouse gas pollution does not mean the U.S. is off the hook.  But the fact that Stephen Miller believes both of those things absolutely does tell you everything you need to know.
