C, Joe Biden will celebrate his first 100 days as president in the Democrats' new favorite state , Karen Townsend, 2021-04-23, It seems like it has been longer but next week Joe Biden will celebrate his 100th day in office. On April 29 he and Jill Biden will travel to Georgia to mark the occasion. In case you haven’t noticed the Democrats are desperate to gain control of the state in the mid-term cycle and Biden is eager to help. Look for him to choose Georgia whenever his handlers allow him to travel out of Washington D.C. Encouraged by the 2020 election cycle which turned over both Senate seats to the Democrats Georgia Democrats are gunning for the governorship in 2022. And they want to make sure that Rev. Raphael Warnock wins a full term in the Senate since his election is only for a two-year term. Warnock won a seat in a special election which means he has to run for a full term in 2022. We’ll be seeing Biden campaign for him and sing the pastor’s praises at every opportunity. Biden traveled to Atlanta in March to tout the passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. He also delivered a speech against anti-Asian hate crimes. I would bet that both Warnock and Jon Ossoff the other Democrat elected to the Senate will be with Biden. Governor Brian Kemp is up for re-election in 2022. He signed into law an election integrity bill that has the Democrats organized and going to battle against Republicans in Georgia. Democrats have cowed large corporations headquartered in the state to comply with demands to label the law as racist “Jim Crow 2.0” which Joe Biden also calls it. This is a dishonest description of the law to put it mildly yet the president of the United States continues to call out one state as racist. Biden has proven that his style of governing includes picking winners and losers including pitting one state against others. The problem with the Democrats’ opposition to the Georgia voting law is that boycotts of the state have been called by activists and that will end up hurting middle-class hardworking Georgians. For example the MLB All-Star game has been moved from Atlanta which will harm those people normally employed during that event as well as businesses who depend on the game’s ticketholders. It was a bone-headed move especially since it was moved to Denver where a voter id is required to cast a ballot. The Georgia law increased the early voting period for example it doesn’t restrict voting. The left aided by Joe Biden is gaslighting the public on the law. Maybe Biden will try to clean up the mess created by the activists in their calls for boycotts and help out Stacey Abrams. Abrams normally all in for political protests wisely saw the damage that boycotts would bring to Georgia and asked that people not participate. She initially offered some confusing messages but finally clarified that she doesn’t think Georgia boycotts are a good idea right now. Abrams has her eye on challenging Governor Kemp in 2022 a rematch of the last gubernatorial election. She has still not conceded that race by the way. She believes she is the rightful Governor of Georgia. She’s a very sore loser. Abrams has seen some real success though in organizing Georgia Democrats to get registered and go vote. Both Ossoff and Warnock owe a debt of gratitude to Abrams and her grassroots organizations who got voters to the polls for them. Biden will encourage Georgians to get COVID-19 vaccinations. The president will headline a drive-in rally in metro Atlanta to highlight his administration’s policies since he was sworn into office in January the White House said. It comes a day after his Wednesday address to a joint session of Congress his first remarks to both chambers since taking office. Biden’s visit coincides with his efforts to speed up coronavirus vaccine distribution and promote a $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal. It also comes as Democrats step up efforts to pass a federal voting rights expansion a push that’s intensified in the wake of a new Georgia election rewrite that Biden has criticized. He is set to be joined by his wife Jill Biden. His trip to Georgia comes the day after Biden addresses a joint session of Congress for the first time.
