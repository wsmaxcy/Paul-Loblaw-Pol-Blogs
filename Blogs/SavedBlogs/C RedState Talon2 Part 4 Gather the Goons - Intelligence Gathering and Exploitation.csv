C, Part 4: Gather the Goons - Intelligence Gathering and Exploitation, Talon2, 2020-12-22, PSA: This is the 5th time I have posted this and I will continue to do so until we win the GA Senate Runoffs. First before we get into the Diary Entry – If you live in GA – vote for Perdue and Loeffler – I don’t care what Lin Wood Sidney Powell Ali or Cernovich said. We can deal with Governor Brian Kemp and that weasel of and SoS later.  Boycotting the vote is about the dumbest idea I have heard the last couple of days. And where I work stupid ideas are like blades of grass.  Yes hinky stuff happened yes it should be investigated yes people should go to jail no we should not gift wrap the Senate to Schumer so he can put the Constitution in a paper shredder and turn the U.S.A. into Venezuela 2.0 Starvation Boogaloo to make a point to “Own the Cons”. To quote COL Schlichter: “We can win outside the margin of fraud. We just can’t do it if pouting whiners sit home muttering about how they are mad cuz things didn’t go their way last time.” Note before we begin: I am using twitter handles as some of the folks mentioned wished to remain as anonymous as possible while still being part of this. *Steps off soap Box* Prior to this we discussed why its important to build a team what teams should look like and how to properly use our team to effect change at the lowest level.  But how do you vector your scarce resources against the highest pay off targets?  You have to understand your enemy not just who it is but everything about them how they move in society who are their allies where do they get funding etc?  How do you think leftists are able to cancel rank and file conservatives so easily?  Because we make it easy on them we assume that their are rule in the game.  Dan Bongino put it best: “These are the new rules We win you lose.”  It i about time we recognize that and start fighting with those words as our mantra. We are now going to look how two of the most effective intelligence gathering methods for our environment. How they  differ how they can be used to help you effect change and how we can mitigate their effects on our side.  Now for all of you wannabe Jason Bourne’s/Ethan Hunt’s you need to get it out of your head that this post is going to allow you to become a super spy.  Sadly intelligence gathering and exploitation is much more mundane and boring.  Lots of internet searches excel spreadsheets relationship building and if you are super tech literate algorithm development.  Sorry didn’t mean to burst your bubble. As we have previously established we are out numbered and out gunned.  We must use the resources we have in a much more targeted and effective manner than if we are on the other side.  Unlike the other side which has a size advantage we are much smaller and much harder to find. We don’t have long approval chains or policies that prevent us from doing what we want to do.  We can go from identification to execution much more quickly than our enemy.  So with out much further ado – here’s the types of intelligence we can use and how we can use them to help further our cause. These are just a start.  You will need to take stock of the situation people and resources around you.  If you are trying to run a rushed HUMINT op on a leftist sherif in small town that votes left 85% of time you will most likely fail because you did not understand your environment.  The smaller the community the harder it is to crack for any type of information.  You must be aware of that.  If you have a friend that can introduce you around to provide you some Bona Fides to the right people that might help speed things along but always be aware the possibility of a trap.  Listen to the little voice in your head.  It is there for a reason. Find what works for you in your particular circumstances.  What works in your town many not work one town over.  Decentralize yourselves.  You will be harder to track and thus target.  You need to become a ghost.  Once you know how your targets operate where they draw funding who their network is you can begin targeting the weak points.   Jobs schools social circles all of them can be targeted.  Leftist running for government position has some spousal abuse issues in his past? maybe you run that at his job or his country club.  Humiliate them.  Issues paying his bills or stiffing people for work done – maybe you send out a mailer with all the documentation proving this person is a deadbeat.  Person has some questionable social contacts within BLM/SJW left and works for a more a more conservative leaning small business maybe you let that persons boss know what they salary is going to support. Your job as collectors and exploiters is not do do any of that – but to provide the information to the direct action/Agitprop team/person to make that happen. As I have said multiple times and will continue to repeat until you all understand it: We know the left hates us. They want us silenced impoverished re-educated or dead. That is an immutable universal truth so I suggest you come to grips with that.  So I ask what are you going to do about it? (P.S. I recommend that you buy both of @offthe_res books Concrete Jungle and Prairie Fire – as someone who has served overseas and seen my fair share of combat it taught me a lot.  For those that have not had the fortunate (unfortunate?) experience of combat it will provide you a base of knowledge that will help you through trying times.) (SOLATAC is one of the best Medical Suppliers of Field Expedient Kits out there.  If you have a specific request Demp and Mrs. Demp can build you pretty much whatever you want.) (If you have questions about CCW Holsters Firearm safety I have two recommendations – they can be found at @Besaba27 and @LibertasInstruc – both of them are super knowledgeable and more than happy to help out anyone who may have questions.) (If you believe in the 2A and want to actually donate to an organization that does something and doesn’t just line their board of directors pockets I suggest you donate or join either Firearms policy Coalition @gunpolicy Gun Owners of America @Gunowners or Second Amendment Foundation @2AFDN) Link to Prairie Fire Link to Solatac Link to Bug Out Bag Packing Lists Full Disclosure – I have zero monied interests in these recommendations – if they were terrible I would say so and would not be recommending them.  They are the heat.  I would not stake my reputation on them if I thought them lacking.
