C, Missing thoughts from the ammo line, Scott Johnson, 2021-01-29, As a result of failure to communicate on my part Ammo Grrrll’s weekly column will not be posted as scheduled this morning. I apologize to Ammo Grrrll and her faithful readers. The fault is mine. I hope to figure out some way to make up for it with Ms. Grrrll in due course. You need a laugh. You deserve a laugh. We count on the laugh regularly scheduled for this time. Something must and will be done.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
