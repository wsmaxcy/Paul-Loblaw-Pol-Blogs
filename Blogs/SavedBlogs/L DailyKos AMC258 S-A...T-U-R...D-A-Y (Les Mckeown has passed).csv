L, S-A...T-U-R...D-A-Y (Les Mckeown has passed), AMC258, 2021-04-22, Saw the headline over on CNN that Les McKeown had passed away. For those unfamiliar and also for those who are familiar with the name Les was the lead singer for the Bay City Rollers in the ‘70s including all their hit years. London (CNN):  Scottish singer Les McKeown who achieved global superstardom in the 1970s as the lead vocalist of tartan-garbed pop titans the Bay City Rollers has died his family confirmed Thursday. He was 65. "It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of our beloved husband and father Leslie Richard McKeown" his family wrote on the singer's Twitter account. "Leslie died suddenly at home on Tuesday." Though they were considered teeny bopper material in their day they actually had some more sophisticated material and quality (particularly in their later albums) and are lightyears ahead of almost anything out there these days. The Rollermania that built up around them was akin to a form of BeatleMania AbbaMania or even the NKOTB mania circa 1990. They were effectively hugely popular in their prime. I recall knowing of them through my older sister. After she went off to college in the early 80s she left her records behind for me to take care of and so I ended up listening to pretty much every album they put out (including at least one of the later Rollers releases). Even though I tended to prefer harder rock (Rush Bad Co. Tull Nazareth Mountain etc.) I still found plenty to appreciate in this group from Scotland. I did not know until reading this CNN article that Ian Mitchell had passed away last year and also that Alan Longmuir had passed in 2018. Variations of lineups have continued over the years and I know their music will live for a long long time. Probably one of their most infectious songs was Saturday Night. And a timely later track is below as well.
