His Linked In page claims a masters from Baptist Theological School of New England a Rhode Island correspondence school that seems to exist only on Facebook.  "Biden is a 'sex trafficking demon-possessed mongrel he's of the left he's no better than the pope Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks and the rest of that wicked crowd -- God is gonna bring the whole house down.' " He went on: "He's gonna expose all these bunch of pedophiles I tell you he's gonna expose Kamala Harris for the Jezebel demon that she is!" Oh and something about the child sex trafficking tunnels under the White House. He has also told his congregants that Trump is still president and that covid vaccines received by public figures were "sugar water." Bless his heart! Hey Rev I think we got a pedophile for ya right here!  For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
