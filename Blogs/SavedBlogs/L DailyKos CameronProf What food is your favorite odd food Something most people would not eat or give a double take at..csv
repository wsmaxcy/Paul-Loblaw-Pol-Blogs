L, What food is your favorite "odd" food? Something most people would not eat or give a double take at., CameronProf, 2021-07-06, I read the Front Page diary asking about what food you would never eat. When i read the responses it reinforced something already known… I am odd.  My least favorite food category is Italian. I eat foods that many in Merica would not eat: Chicken Feet Eel Jellyfish etc. The more “exotic” the better.  I have 3 rules about what I would or would not eat.  Rule One: If it contains either bugs or blood no. No chocolate meat for me please. Rule Two: If it contains 99.99 percent from an item that lives in the water: Yes please. Rule Three: If Rule One os obeyed I will try anything and everything.  I figure f you do not try something how will you know if you like it or not? Reading the FP diary yesterday I was amazed by foods many people would not eat: Olives? Okra? Mushrooms? Many foods listed I consider a normal part of my diet.  So I thought what is the oddest/most unique food that you eat that most others would find odd?  I have too many to list but I guess my top 1 would be chicken feet.
