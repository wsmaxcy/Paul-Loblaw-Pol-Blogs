C, The Wuhan Flu One Year Later, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-17, As we know it about a year ago that we began the two-week lockdown to “flatten the curve” which will linger in the annals of government doublespeak for a long time since “two weeks” turned out to mean “a year.” Somewhere along the way it became “racist” to call it the “Wuhan virus” which must be insulting to the West Nile virus the Spanish influenza of 1918 the Zika virus the Hong Kong flu and all the other viruses named for their geographical place of origin that never got the protection of political correctness. In any case good to have a look back at how the media discussed the virus a year ago courtesy of the Media Research Center:  Chaser from one year ago:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
