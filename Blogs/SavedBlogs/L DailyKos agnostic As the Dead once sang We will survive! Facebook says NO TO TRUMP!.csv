L, As the Dead once sang "We will survive!" Facebook says NO TO TRUMP!, agnostic, 2021-05-05, I am no facebook fan. Have not been am not and will not be. Several years ago on an unrelated matter I had the opportunity to meet a former IT engineer (they have a boatload of them depending how one defines a boatload) from Facebook. In his deposition He bluntly described how even in private chats allegedly private messaging and private postings Facebook does not care. It takes every bit of data even connections made in a session to other sites analyzes it packages it and sells it for profit. Every single electron. And stores it then sells it.   Have you ever noticed that if you talk about small penises on facebook you get spammed with many ads on how to increase your girth and length? Or if you post about postpartum blues and stress you start getting ads for diapers and baby clothes? Or if you are worried about your breast size means to increase the perkiness and size?   The examples are endless. That is neither a coincidence or an accident. Your private details were sold for profit and you didn’t even know it. I would venture a guess Facebook’s internal knowledge about your behavior choices lifestyle and socio-economic status probably matches what the IRS FBI CIA NSA DOD Social security and other govt. orgs know about you.  For many the targeted ads are welcome. For others this Big Bother approach to data collection is as scary as the Soviet Threat of the 1960s the “black lives matter” the “LGBT” and voter fraud threats of the 2020s even the marijuana threat of the 1920s. And it should be. Why would any group care if you protest how our police and prosecutors mistreat people of color? especially unarmed peaceful young men and teens of color?   Yet today I take my hat off physically and emotionally to Facebook. They EXTENDED THEIR BAN on Trump after a long involved and not very contentious bored meeting. (ahem)  NO TRUMP ON FACEBOOK! The anti-American treasonous lying cheating violence fomenting twice impeached loser will not be allowed back on to Facebook. I presume the twits of tweeter will follow suit — which will lead to Ruddy Ghouliani filing suit or another of his legal eagles demanding reinstatement and access.  Facebook has done America nay this entire flat earth a YUGE favor.   Thank you Mr. Book.
