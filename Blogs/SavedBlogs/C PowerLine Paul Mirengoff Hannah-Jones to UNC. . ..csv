C, Hannah-Jones to UNC. . ., Paul Mirengoff, 2021-07-06, No thanks Go to hell. Nikole Hannah-Jones author of the New York Times’ discredited 1619 Project has  turned down the University of North Carolina’s  controversial offer of tenure. She will take her talents BS to Howard University. Hannah-Jones comes out the winner if one assumes as I do that she doesn’t mind teaching (or whatever she will do) at a fourth rate institution. She won the tenure battle and then told the university what it could do with its offer. UNC the university not its students is the clear loser. It has been humiliated having gone through a wrenching divisive battle only to be snubbed in the end by Hannah-Jones.  The leftist faculty will blame UNC’s initial balking at a tenure grant for the loss of one of its heroes. Many alums will remain outraged by the fact that the university ended up offering tenure to a leftist hack. For  Walter Hussman Jr. the major donor after whom UNC’s journalism school is named I suppose this outcome generates mixed feelings. The university he loves has taken a blow. He’s been vilified and the vilification is far from over. And the university went against his wishes. On the other hand it was his opposition to granting Hannah-Jones tenure that caused her not to become a faculty member. In explaining her decision she  said “I cannot imagine working at and advancing a school named for a man who lobbied against me. . . .” Now Mr. Hussman won’t have to imagine the journalism school he funds providing a platform and its prestige to a race-mongering charlatan. Surely there’s some solace in that.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
