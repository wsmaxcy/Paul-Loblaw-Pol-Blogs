L, $800 Matching Fund Offer! Help a Struggling Kossack on Helping Humpday at Street Prophets, DixiecollieforStreet Prophets, 2021-04-21, HHday resides at the Street Prophets Coffee Hour the intersection where politics and religion and faith and history and ethical values and art and serendipity conveniently meet and sometimes collide. This is an open thread. Here’s what we do and why we do it: Humpday — because we’re smack dab in the middle of the work week and getting over that hump sure looks sweet. But for some folks in this community the humps they need to get over are far more daunting than looking forward to the weekend. That is where Helping comes in. Helping Humpday is specifically about generating community support for struggling Kossacks who find themselves facing an imminent financial need like keeping the lights on avoiding eviction getting to work paying medical bills. Our goal is to publicize the Community Needs List and other fundraisers for needy Kossacks as widely across the site as possible. Our motto is simple: many hands make light work. The folks on the Community Needs List are struggling. Some need help with a one-time emergency. Others have been have struggled for months. They are working towards financial independence and self-sufficiency but still need some help. Your small gift can help a family or individual find stability for another month in the face of a crisis.  Even $3 or $5 or $10 helps. It all adds up. Thank you so much. Also tip rec comment here and in the individual diaries. Share on social media. That helps spread the word. Breaking News — Matching Fund Challenge For JTG [Just awaiting confirmation from jtg himself] Just in as we were about to “go to press”: a whopping generous $800 matching fund challenge has just been offered to recharge JTG’s fundraiser and get his summer tuition and school expenses fully funded.  JTG is so tantalizingly close to being self-sufficient. After struggling for years as a well respected but underpaid substitute teacher jtg made the difficult choice to return to college to get his teaching credentials. It will give him financial security at last but that came at a very high short-term price: he had to forego a paycheck from subbing for a year. JTG is in the  final months of his unpaid teaching internship and he has just one FINAL Summer Semester to complete his teacher training and become a fully certified elementary school teacher. He expects to be employed full time by the fall (fingers crossed). It would be very sad if lack of subsistence funding caused him to lose his home and his pets or forced him to drop out of teacher training when he is so close. Let’s help him raise the tuition now! In his own words: The end of my fundraising is within sight... I know there are others in great need as well and I am often anxious that I am asking for help but I have to do so. #jtg Let’s try to raise $800 today to met this match!

What’s the philosophy behind the Community Needs List? I will let bfitzinAR the original founder of Helping Humpday speak for us: Kossacks taking care of our own — helping by sharing/donating money or needed items helping by sharing both donation site links and artisan/vendor site links and purchasing gifts for self or others via those links helping by sharing knowledge and informational links or helping by just sharing a hug or a cup of coffee as appropriate — is what community is all about. We are community — clan tribe company village culture and state. Community survives beyond the life of any single member and thrives by supporting and strengthening the life of each individual member — by helping each other by sharing — all together. Until such time as we get the government that we want and deserve when there will be no need for fundraisers there will always be some Kossacks who need the help and compassion of this kind friendly and generous community.  Today’s selection is Whitney Houston’s rousing gospel version of Hold On Help Is On the Way.
