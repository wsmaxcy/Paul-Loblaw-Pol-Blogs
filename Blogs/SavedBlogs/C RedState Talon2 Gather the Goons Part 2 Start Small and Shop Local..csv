C, Gather the Goons Part 2: Start Small and Shop Local., Talon2, 2020-12-08, PSA: This is the 2nd time I have posted this and I will continue to do so until the GA Runoffs. First before we get into the Diary Entry – If you live in GA – vote for Perdue and Loeffler – I don’t care what Lin Wood Sidney Powell Ali or Cernovich said.  I don’t care how much you hate Brian Kemp or that weasel of a SoS.  They can be dealt with (through a primary challenge) later. Boycotting the vote is about the dumbest idea I have heard the last couple of days. And where I work stupid ideas are like blades of grass.  Yes hinky stuff happened yes it should be investigated yes people should go to jail no we should not gift wrap the Senate to Schumer so he can put the Constitution in a paper shredder and turn the U.S.A. into Venezuela 2.0 Starvation Boogaloo to make a point to “Own the Cons”. As COL Schlichter said: “We can win outside the margin of fraud. We just can’t do it if pouting whiners sitting home muttering about how they are mad cuz things didn’t go their way last time.”  I got it. Its unfair.  Well too bad. If you still feel like whining go back and reread my first post.  Internalize it decide if you feel like fighting for your beliefs and then come back to this one if you aren’t a wuss.  You can’t win if you don’t show up *Steps off Soap Box* In Part: 1 of Gather the Goons we covered a couple of things that I would like to reiterate: In part one we laid the ground work.  We have identified that we have to overcome our fears internally. We must harden our psyche and ensure we have both the personal emotional fortitude to embark on this mission but also that we have the built in support systems to fall back on should it be necessary.  The second part is to reach out to like minded people and start building teams capable of supporting your end goal.  In this fight numbers will initially mean nothing quality of personnel is paramount. As @offthe_res said in his book Prairie Fire “I would rather have 4 totally committed folks then 50 weekenders”. This allows me to know who I can inevitably count on when times are tough. It is critical you develop these relationships with like minded folks so that you have a network which will allow you procure needed supplies as well as provide social support during what will be very challenging times.  This will take time and the only time better than yesterday to undertake this is right now. Start Small and Shop Local. The primary reason to focus on building your team now and at the local level building your political team is make all of the mistakes early.  Why is this important?  Do you know how much time military units spend training for war? 1000s upon 1000s of hours prior to deployment.  They spend it learning how to shoot move and communicate work as team and operate on the fly when the cost of mistakes is low.  If you screw up a movement to contact drill with blanks and training IEDs procured from the Training Room the cost of that screw up is probably going to be getting called an idiot by your Platoon Sergeant ringing ears for a couple of hours and being the target of a skit at the next dining out.  But no one died and you will have learned what not to do.  I don’t know about anyone else but I learn when I make mistakes not when I do things correctly.   Once you have Identified and potentially recruited a couple of like minded individuals or at least started the process we can begin to assess what is going on around us and plan small scale operations to gain a foothold. For many of us (Unless your last name happens to be Bush Romney or McCain I feel dirty just typing those names) you will have very limited if any political clout. That being said what can you do? There are many organizations that you can influence with your new found Team. Remember when I talked about going hard in the paint like Shaq c.1997 at my local PTA?  I made a mistake before I went in there.  A big one.  I didn’t shape conditions of the engagement prior to launching my attack and I got smoked. Now sure there were other people in there who were having the same thoughts as me and it felt god to have a MIC drop moment but we didn’t know the other even existed much less talked about coordinating our efforts.  Now imagine the same group of us coordinate our efforts. I go hard in the paint and my teammates space the floor not giving the PTA panel the ability to key in on any one of us.  Now the PTA has to deal with 5-10 parents who have all done their homework and are throwing elbows to the panel members like 90s Pistons BadBoys Bill Lambier Dennis Rodman and John Salley. Even better would be to task one of the group to get it on video and then post it to social media.  I have just put the PTA back on their heels and maybe some of the more squishy parents now see that these imbeciles we have trusted with our children are not qualified to dictate what our children will learn. If anything we should be telling them what we want our children to learn not the other way around! You want to ban me from showing up? Even better!  I will periscope (that’s what the kids do now a days right?) right outside with me and my people as well as other parents who agree with us and we will raise unholy hell.  Messaging is critical make it look like the big bad state is crushing the little guy – this is the war of the flea and make no mistake we are the flea. Who remembers the Tea Party wave of 2010 and resulting decimation of the left at the state level? Why was this important – it allowed the Right to get reps in.  It allowed us to screen candidates early at the state and local level so we are not finding out stuff when they are running for a U.S. Senate Seat *cough* Cal Cunningham *cough*. Was it Perfect? No Looking at you Todd Akin Christine O’Donnell and you Judge Roy Moore. So you and your team should start finding the local chapter Republican Club and infiltrate it.  Offer to run fundraising and recruiting activities voter registration drives etc.  They need all the help they can get and some of these organizations (VA Republican Party I am looking squarely at you) have allowed themselves to become slow and sclerotic much like the leftist leviathan we are trying to defeat.  Take them over from the inside.  Be ruthless if old guard in the organization are refusing to change but instead want to manage the decline then it looks like its time for a palace coup. Get your inner Lucius Cornelius Sulla on and take over (nonviolently of course. I cant believe I have to caveat it….). Remember that team you built now would be the time to employ them to ensure that you can assume the power structure of the organization.  After all you will need trusted LTs to ensure that the organization doesn’t fall back into old habits and any resistance to the new conservative leadership is stomped out.  Be merciless these lazy politicians have allowed your area to degenerate and they deserve no quarter. Some states and localities won’t need this level of action.  But some will.  If you have to ask the question you should probably get involved. Why is it important to focus at the local level?  I mean sure don’t forget about the national level stuff.  Read the PSA at the top of the page if you doubt me. It is important. However local elections have the most sway over how you live your life.  So lets say the unthinkable happens.  Biden (please god no) wins and the Trust Fund Socialist and the Jeremiah Wright Disciple win the GA runoffs (you should have listened to my PSA). They proceed to ram through an Assault Weapons Ban (I know I know its a made up term). Who do you think is going to come and try and collect up all of the pews? Federal Law enforcement? They barely had the strength and numbers to hold off a group of untrained Antifa weirdos outside a court house!  And that is assuming the State Governments even allow the Feds to intervene. 10th Amendment Baby nice job proggies you already set the precedent with the Illegals and sanctuary cities.  The military? If that happens we will have MUCH bigger problems and believe me all of you mouth breathers out there screeching “TrUmP ShOuLd EnAcT MaRtiAL LaW!” you have no idea what you are asking for. So who is going to get tagged with this unsavory and potentially hazardous duty? Its going to be the local PD and sheriffs who are going to be tasked with it.  Now if you have done this correctly you have built your network you have gone to meetings with the local sheriffs you have made it know to your county commissioners and state reps/senators that this is not a tenable situation you will have more success resisting. A great example of this is the 2A sanctuary movement. In the state in which I currently reside Virginia a smooth 85-90% of the counties have said “mmmm nah” to an AWB and dared the Governor to do something about it.  There was between 25-35000 people at the Capitol for the VCDL lobby day.  That sent a message – but it was also the 25000+ emails and phone calls that the state reps/senators received over the prior month that showed them they better not get froggy.  Now the Libs in VA are looking over their shoulders thinking “Oh Sh*t we done messed up now.” They know that the people of VA won’t stand for it and the counties that have declared themselves as 2A sanctuaries have told the governor “yeah we aren’t expending resources on your idiotic idea you want them you spend state resources”. Is this ideal? HELL NO! But its a start. To give you some idea where this is going: Part 3: Gather the Goons – Team Construction and Practical Survival Part 4: Gather the Goons – Intelligence Gathering and Exploitation Part 5: Gather the Goons – Make Yourself and your organization Indispensable Part 6: Gather the Goons – The War of the Flea – How to beat Leviathan We know the left hates us. They want us silenced impoverished re-educated or dead. That is an immutable universal truth so I suggest you come to grips with that.  So I ask what are you going to do about it? (P.S. I recommend that you buy both of @offthe_res books Concrete Jungle and Prairie Fire – as someone who has served overseas and seen my fair share of combat it taught me a lot.  For those that have not had the fortunate (unfortunate?) experience of combat it will provide you a base of knowledge that will help you through trying times.
