L, BREAKING: Haitian President Jovenel Moïse Assassinated; First Lady Injured, Toro Blanco, 2021-07-07, The President of Haiti has been assassinated at his private residence in Port-au-Prince.  The First Lady was wounded as well by gunshot.  According to interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph "The security situation of the country is under the control of the Haitian National Police and the Haitian Armed Forces. All measures are being taken to guarantee the continuity of the State and to protect the nation. Democracy and the Republic will triumph."    Allegedly the assassins entered the residence claiming they were DEA agents though details are still coming in as this story is new.  The White House released a statement condemning the assassination: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and the attack on First Lady Martine Moïse of Haiti. We condemn this heinous act and I am sending my sincere wishes for First Lady Moïse’s recovery” the statement read. Opposition leaders have likewise condemned the killing with Haitian economist and anti-corruption activist Emmanuela Douyon saying she was “shocked” that the attack demonstrates "the extent to which violence reigns in Haiti."  She added: Justice must be served. We the Haitian people must stop the current political crisis and end the vicious cycle of violence President Moïse was accused of autocratic rule over the past few years (due to the effectively defunct Haitian Parliament and widespread failures to hold regional and national elections among other issues) and opponents had demanded his resignation earlier in 2021 after claiming his term legally ended in February.  The United States United Nations and the Organization of American States all supported his fifth year in office however (the disagreement between him and his opponents stemmed from when he officially began serving his term).  General elections in Haiti were scheduled for later this year along with a controversial constitutional referendum.  This diary will be updated if needed as the story develops  Sources:www.cbsnews.com/… www.democracynow.org/… www.cnn.com/...
