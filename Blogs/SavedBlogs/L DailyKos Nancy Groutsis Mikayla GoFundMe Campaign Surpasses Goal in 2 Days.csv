L, Mikayla GoFundMe Campaign Surpasses Goal in 2 Days, Nancy Groutsis, 2021-05-08, I’m glad to report that Calvina Strothers’ GoFundMe campaign to hire investigators to find out the truth about her daughter’s death has surpassed its funding goal in 2 days. As of this writing Strothers has raised $47430 of her $40000 goal. I made a donation today. We want to know the truth but the police dragged their feet and made false statements; so it’s necessary to hire an independent investigator.  I was at the May 6th vigil and I noticed most of the police looked nervous. When I was leaving to get the bus one officer anxiously asked me where I was from. I said “Framingham” a town a few miles from Hopkinton. He thought about that for a while out loud. I guessed he was wondering how many people from out of town would find out. I used to live in Hopkinton and it’s a small insular town. People from out-of-state attended the vigil. USA Today and other national news companies reported Mikayla’s tragedy. This morning I spoke to my mom who lives in Greece and she said she expects to hear about Mikayla on the Greek news because they frequently report Black Lives Matter stories. I am not stating a fact but it is my opinion that Mikayla was murdered. I expect this story is going to get a lot more gruesome as we hear details of the investigations. Mikayla deserves that the truth be revealed and the Village deserves accountability when one of our young ones is harmed.
