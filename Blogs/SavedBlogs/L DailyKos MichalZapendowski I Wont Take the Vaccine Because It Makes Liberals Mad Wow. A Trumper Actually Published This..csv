L, "I Won't Take the Vaccine Because It Makes Liberals Mad" Wow. A Trumper Actually Published This., MichalZapendowski, 2021-04-27, I was just amazed to discover this on the internet today. The title is literally “I Won’t Take the Vaccine Because It Makes Liberals Mad.” The author Peter D'Abrosca describes himself as “a conservative campaign strategist author and columnist.” I had never heard of him before today. But I think he did the whole world a favor by penning this profound insight into the mentality of many members of his own political party. Here are some highlights that basically summarize what he has to say: “I’m not really avoiding the vaccine due to potential medical complications or because of the speed with which it was produced.  Personal liberty is not the reason I’m avoiding it either. . . My primary reason for refusing the vaccine is much simpler: I dislike the people who want me to take it and it makes them mad when they hear about my refusal. That in turn makes me happy. . . I have decided that because the vile political Left which I despise in the abstract wants me to take their coveted vaccine I simply will not. . . My newly formed and well-developed opinion on vaccines is this: if those bastards want me to get the jab I’m not going to do it because it annoys them.  Perhaps you think I’m being obtuse. I do not care.” So yeah um ten years from now… when you are asking yourself why COVID-19 is still circulating in the U.S. and why people are still dying of it every year when it has been successfully wiped out in other rich democracies (including already New Zealand Australia and Taiwan) you can go back and re-read this amazing piece of self-centered Republican bloviating which Peter D’Abrosca proudly published which just really perfectly explains the mentality that is to put it mildly holding half of this country back. I mean I honestly think his piece should be included in history textbooks someday. Basically kids if the “vile political left” wanted Republicans to do something they did the opposite.It was really that simple. Whether it was good or bad for them for their country whatever — that stuff simply didn’t enter into the equation. “Make liberals mad.” That was the only policy goal. (Incidentally it’s one that perfectly explains why someone would vote for Donald Trump.) “I do not care.” That should be the new motto of D’Abrosca’s party in my opinion. Or maybe: “Give me liberty or give me death — whichever one it is the liberals don’t want.”
