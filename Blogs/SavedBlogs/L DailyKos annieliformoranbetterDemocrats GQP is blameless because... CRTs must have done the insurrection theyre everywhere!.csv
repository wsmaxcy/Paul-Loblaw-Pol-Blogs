L, GQP is blameless because... CRTs must have done the insurrection they're everywhere!, annieliformoranbetterDemocrats, 2021-06-28, Clinical dissociation: Dissociative disorders are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts memories surroundings actions and identity. People with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and cause problems with functioning in everyday life.   Some Trump supporters we met at his rally in Ohio on Saturday have bought into the false notion that he can be reinstated this summer. One man suggested if he isn't there'd be a civil war. pic.twitter.com/4D9RyV31DT  The greatest threat to our democracy isn't Trump. It's election laws that are designed to insulate Republican power from an increasingly diverse American majority.The nation's focus on Trump’s socio-pathologies has obscured the danger of this strategy.   www.altereddimensions.net/... CRTs were once synonymous with television. By 1960 nearly 90 percent of American households had one. But at the turn of the millennium their popularity rapidly decayed as LCD panels flooded the market. Even though CRTs comprised an estimated 85 percent of US television sales in 2003 analysts were already predicting the technology’s demise. In 2008 LCD panels outsold CRTs worldwide for the first time. Sony shut down its last manufacturing plants that same year essentially abandoning its famous Trinitron CRT brand. By 2014 even stronghold markets like India were fading with local manufacturers switching to flat-panel displays. [...] Toward the end of the CRT era manufacturers began directly competing with the plasma and liquid-crystal displays that were threatening to overtake the market. The mid-2000s saw a brief enthusiasm for “ultra-slim” models which touted tubes as miraculously thin as 15 inches. Some manufacturers adopted new high-definition HDMI connections. These machines maintained a tenuous advantage at first: new flat-panel TVs cost thousands of dollars and consumers had to sort through a confusing assortment of unproven display technologies. But as these screens got cheaper bigger and had higher-resolutions there was no way for the CRT to win. Its design relied on a fat glass tube which became deeper and heavier with every added inch of screen space. Sony’s hulking 40-inch Trinitron from 2002 one of the biggest consumer CRTs ever produced weighed over 300 pounds. A modern 40-inch Sony TV the second-smallest option in its current lineup weighs less than 20 pounds. www.theverge.com/...   American Media Banned In Other Countries https://t.co/EDRPA3ak7S pic.twitter.com/LfoTVt8wG0 A Hill-HarrisX poll released last week found that 30 percent of Republican voters believe Trump will be reinstated in August though there is no legal or constitutional maneuver that could feasibly return the former U.S. president to office in the midst of President Biden's own term. Trump himself has reportedly told acquaintances that he expects to be reinstated in August. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said earlier in June that the large number of Republicans who believe this conspiracy theory is a “glaring warning on the persistent acceptance of the stolen election narrative." thehill.com/...

Nearly six months later Morning Consult polling has found that while the bulk of the overall electorate still shares that perspective Republican voters appear to be following their leaders as they become increasingly likely to disassociate themselves their party and Trump from the insurrection. Since a Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted Jan. 6-7 the share of Republican voters who said Trump was at least somewhat responsible for the events that led to the Capitol attack fell 11 percentage points to 30 percent while the share who said the same of Republicans in Congress fell by a similar share to 22 percent in the June 18-20 survey. Both surveys were conducted among roughly 2000 registered voters with 2-point margins of error. https://t.co/e4QUrmyxNU?amp=1 Republican Voters Largely Want to Move On From Jan. 6.
