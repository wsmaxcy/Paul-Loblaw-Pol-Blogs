L, Summer of Soul - have you seen it yet?, guavaboy, 2021-07-04, Waiting to see who else might write about this on DKOS and surprised to see that nobody has. This is a short diary I want to put it up so I can discuss this masterpiece with about a million of my friends…... Here is the trailer:   Here is an interview with the man who put it together:  As for me I found myself hyperventilating through most of the film.  I have felt joy in my life but I don’t get to feel it very often. Yesterday was one of those days because of this movie. The clips of background history as well as the tasteful voice-overs when artists were asked to comment on  video of their own performance from fifty-two years ago were wonderful.  In short:  Go See this movie! bring your friends! Please share your own opinion below.
