L, Jim Acosta? 'What's Next? An Insurrection At Your Local School Board Meeting?', Heather, 2021-06-27, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  I hate to break it to CNN's Jim Acosta but that's pretty much what's happening already at these school board meetings across the country. As our friend Steve M. noted on Twitter this looks like the Tea-Party 2.0. They staged a Brooks Brothers riot in Loudoun County because the first test of their theory that trans-bashing and an anti-CRT moral panic can win elections is the Virginia governor's race which is this year not next year. — Steve M.

(@nomoremister) June 24 2021 Acosta took Trump and his enablers to task as he prepared to give yet another MAGA rally in Ohio this Saturday. ...he's been complaining about a rigged election for nearly eight months now but each week Trump's big lie gets smaller when compared to the chilling new body cam videos from the insurrection released by federal authorities. After playing footage of "MyPillow guy" Mike Lindell being mocked on The Daily Show for his ridiculous claim that Trump will be reinstated in August Acosta noted "That's funny stuff and it would be great if we could all just have one big laugh. But this is getting dangerous" before playing a clip of the OAN "reporter" calling for the execution of Americans who "stole" the election from Trump. Acosta continued to run through the list of the idiocy we've seen from the likes of Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson the chaos that manufactured outrage has created at school boards across the country "Tucker Karlsson" and his verbal assault on General Mark Milley and Laura Ingraham pushing to defund the military before summing up what this is really all about. It's about pitting one set of Americans against another over the election over Critical Race Theory or whatever the next unserious outrage theory comes out of FOX News or Mar-a-Lago. If we stop fighting each other and start embracing the truth these guys over here they're going to run out of things to talk about. And maybe even run out of money too. But hey they could run off and join the circus. I hear they're hiring clowns. They're not going to run out of money any time soon. The list of billionaires willing to fund this stuff is way too long. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
