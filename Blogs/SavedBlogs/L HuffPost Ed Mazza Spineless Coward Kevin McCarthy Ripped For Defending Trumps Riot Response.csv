L, 'Spineless Coward': Kevin McCarthy Ripped For Defending Trump's Riot Response, Ed Mazza, 2021-04-26, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was called out on social media for defending former President Donald Trump’s failure to rein in his supporters as they attacked the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection. McCarthy initially said Trump “bears responsibility” for the riot and admitted the then-president was too slow to respond.  “He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding” McCarthy said a week after the insurrection. But on Sunday he changed his tune completely telling Fox News that Trump promised to help stop the violent attack on the Capitol carried out by his supporters.  “And that’s what he did” McCarthy said. “He put a video out later.” Trump waited hours to release the video eventually telling the rioters “we love you” as he asked them to go home.  On Sunday McCarthy wouldn’t answer a question about a report claiming his conversation with Trump during the riot didn’t go nearly as well as he indicated.   Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) said McCarthy told her that when he asked Trump to stop the attack the then-president replied: “Well Kevin I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” McCarthy’s flip-flop led to quite the reaction on Twitter:   Kevin McCarthy is such a spineless coward.  pic.twitter.com/fywtNS38D9 Kevin McCarthy is a traitor and a coward. worst House leader of either party. ever. https://t.co/8DmbBFRsJe What's amazing about lickspittle Kevin McCarthy whitewashing Jan 6 by pretending Trump didn't know what was happening is that Trump basically told McCarthy that if the mob got to him it was his own fault if CNN's reporting is right:https://t.co/RblFL5LVCO pic.twitter.com/ZxgT89qGsB House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office slams McCarthy remarks on Fox News accusing him of rewriting history: “McCarthy previously claimed Trump was to blame for the violent attack he incited at the Capitol.” What a fucking coward https://t.co/NaMaHEzrVE In this clip McCarthy is perfectly happy to provide confirmations or denials about his conversations with Trump when its flattering for him. But when asked about this quote from Trump he says "My conversations with the President are my conversations with the President." https://t.co/ugQQQch6Bm The fact that Kevin McCarthy refuses to answer what Trump told him during the insurrection on January 6th should put him in the hot seat and be subpoenaed by Congress. What does the @GOPLeader really know and why is he covering up for Trump? Even Fox Propaganda’s Chris Wallace was able to make Kevin McCarthy squirm like the vile cowardly criminal sycophant that he is. McQarthy is as responsible for inciting insurrection as Ted Cruz and Marjorie Greene.
