L, Would a national background check referendum pass?, hoosieraaron, 2021-04-26, This post is excerpted from my newsletter on public opinion politics and democracy with an Indiana perspective. Subscribe here if you liked and follow me on Twitter!  I wasn’t planning on writing about gun opinions again after doing so just a few weeks ago but then this happened. My city Indianapolis has become the epicenter of mass shootings in 2021 so it’s hard to think of anything else right now. We were even featured on the The Daily podcast this week which is never good. I’ve written about gun opinions before and you have no doubt seen the countless polls showing overwhelming majorities in favor of universal background checks. Today’s post poses the hypothetical situation of a national referendum vote on background checks for all gun purchases. Would it pass? Probably but it would be a lot closer than most people think. There are some important lessons and conclusions from this thought exercise for those who care about meaningful change on guns.  Why does this matter? Aren’t background checks for guns universally popular? A recurring conversation in the polling community is about whether or not issue polling suffers from the same error as election polls do. There are varying opinions on this but I think it would be naïve to believe that issue polling doesn’t suffer from at least similar error as election horse-race polling.  That doesn’t mean issue polling is “bad” because election polls do a better job than anything else of telling you who is most likely to win. The average error in presidential polls over the past few decades is about 4 points. In all elections the average error is about 6 points. That’s pretty good considering that telephone response rates are now in the single digits. Polling only gets a bad rap in elections closer than the average error. It just so happens that our current political era produces extremely close elections. That being said error persists. It’s always a good idea to keep in mind that a margin of error exists for a reason and it’s actually about double what the pollster reports. If you keep the margin of error in mind and don’t overreact to outliers or small changes that could just be noise I think issue polls are worth your while. Let’s talk about gun control polls. Background checks for all gun purchases has been polled many times and almost always shows super-majorities in favor. One poll that gets shared frequently is this one from Quinnipiac in 2017. Few issues can garner 90% agreement in 2021. This Quinnipiac poll wasn’t much of an outlier either as recent polls from other firms have shown similar support. It seems that something that popular would pass overwhelmingly if put to the voters in a referendum. Well let’s see. There have been four recent votes directly on universal background checks. What’s going on here? Had the referendum passed easily in each state I wouldn’t be writing this post. But that didn’t happen so we should think more deeply about what it means for gun polls referendums and polling in general.  The Discrepancy To assess the polling error it’s best to look at polls specifically asking voters in these states leading up to the referendum how they intended to vote and then compare with the election results. This is a fairer comparison than using the Quinnipiac result mentioned earlier. Polls preceding each vote showed solid majorities in favor of background checks in each state. All polling averages showed at least 60% in favor and at least a 25 point gap between support and oppose. You can view the full list of polls here. California polls performed best but still overestimated the margin of victory by 13 points. Nevada and Maine were off by nearly 30 points. They were better than those “90% in favor” surveys but it was still an utterly dismal performance for polls. While I’m not sure why these pre-referendum polls were still off by so much I do have a few ideas about how national gun control surveys can differ so much from these polls and the election results. In the abstract people think owning a gun is a big responsibility so most people answer the poll affirmatively in support of background checks. I think it might be the same reason that large majorities support voter ID laws. Respondents might also be reacting to news of another high profile mass shooting when the poll was taken. But once you tie that question to an upcoming election people start to get sorted into their partisan camps. When candidates you support from your preferred party are telling you that a referendum is good then you might become more likely to support it. Conversely you might also be more likely to oppose a referendum put forth by the other team. There is a lot of advertising and PR that happens in the run up to a referendum like this ad from the Clark County DA in Nevada.  That’s probably why the polls for the California referendum only showed around 60% support in one of the most liberal states in the nation. Elections inherently cause partisan sorting that transcend particular policy preferences. Once supporting background checks makes someone feel like they are a bad Republican for doing so they become less likely to support it. (Not all issues are like this and I’ll explain more on that in a bit.) 95% can go down to 60% real quick in a partisan-sorting event like an election. Factor in turnout issue-group mobilization and “lower-quality” local polls that are undercounting more conservative voters (as we now know they were) and you can get some surprising referendum results. These outcomes don’t bode well for our hypothetical national matchup.   The Method If gun opinions devolve into a voter’s partisan leanings in the voting booth then we can use a simple measure called “Partisan Voter Index” (PVI) to predict a national referendum. PVI tells you where each state leans relative to the nation as a whole by comparing each to the national popular vote. Hawaii has the largest Democratic lean at D +15 while Wyoming has the largest Republican lean at R +26. Indiana is R +11. Here’s what the PVI map looks like. Georgia Arizona Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania all went to Biden in 2020 but they are all more Republican than the nation as a whole.  All of those states are light red on the map. Our national national background check referendum prediction will be generated by placing the recent state referendum votes in the context of the PVI scores.  Caveats First I am not a political scientist or statistician. There are assuredly more complex ways of predicting this. I’m also using election results from a few years ago and PVI scores that have been recalculated for 2020. It’s an imperfect comparison. I’m not seeking point estimates with confidence intervals or anything I’m just a guy with a blog interested in politics and polling. Next I don’t think the failure of polling in the lead up to these votes is a fair representation of all issue polling. Referendum elections are inherently different from issue polls. Interest group activation partisanship voter turnout all affect the final results. Most importantly not all issues are like guns. Democratic data scientist David Shor laid out a few other issues where broad hypothetical support for a progressive policy is able to withstand all of the partisan pressures that come with an election.  Minimum wage - genuinely popular enough to overcome interest group oppositionMedicaid expansion - Federal policy means it's basically free the health care industry heavily lobbies for itMarijuana legalization - doesn't threaten capital so capital doesn't try to stop it I think he’s right. Florida voters passed a $15 minimum wage and Oklahomans passed Medicaid expansion over the past few years. There’s something particular to guns that makes people retreat to their camps when push comes to shove. Elliott Morris of the Economist had a great newsletter this week about this very topic where he highlighted some Wisconsin marijuana polling data from Charles Franklin of Marquette University. Franklin’s data showed about 60% of Wisconsin voters in favor of the marijuana legalization referendum in 2018. When the results came in voters in every county with the question on the ballot passed it. The bluer counties (Milwaukee and Dane) had the strongest support and even received 59% in Racine County that Trump carried by 4 points in 2020. This was a good performance for referendum polls. South Dakota passed legal marijuana as well 54%-45% while Trump won the state 61%-35% 2020. Polls have consistently shown broad majorities in favor of legalization even in South Dakota. So not all issues are created equal. Gun control just seems to be one that is particularly divisive despite the strong polling. Knowing now that gun opinions might devolve to partisanship at the ballot box and that does not mean that all polling is bad what would a national referendum look like?  Maps Here we go. The PVI scores of the four states with referendums are: If you look at the distribution Maine and Nevada fall in the center while California and Washington are well to the left. Referring back to our referendum results it makes sense that Maine and Nevada would fall in the middle. The Nevada question passed by 1 point while failing in Maine by 4. That tells me that states in the center of this distribution are likely to struggle passing a background check law. I’ve put together a map below that has every state in blue where I think the question would be approved and states in red where I think it would fail. I think we can reasonably guess that states to the left of Maine would pass a referendum. Conversely every state to the right of Michigan is in the “fail” group. The states in grey are tossups which includes Michigan Nevada Minnesota New Hampshire and Maine. You can see that “fail” has already won an electoral college scenario and the map is shaping up to be very similar to Clinton/Trump 2016. Nevada already passed a referendum. There is reason to think that the state is trending toward the GOP (it’s not highly educated for one) but let’s go ahead and give it to “Team Approve” since it passed. New Hampshire has the same PVI as Nevada and I could see it going either way. The state motto isn’t “Live Free or Die” for nothing. But education polarization rules all so let’s say the referendum barely passes there. Minnesota votes approve as well. The state went from a 2 point Clinton win in 2016 to a 7 point win for Biden in 2020. It’s one of the few Midwest states where Democrats are doing well.  The state with the most wiggle room for me is Michigan. The Wolverine state has a PVI score of R +1 just one point redder than Nevada. But Biden won Michigan by 3 points while Hillary lost it by less than 1 in 2016. Nevada on the other hand went from Clinton +2.4 to Biden +3.6. Michigan moved more than Nevada. Because of that I think it’s reasonable to say Michigan would have a similar result as Nevada in a background check referendum.  Maine is just weird. The rate of ticket-splitting there is significant with Biden winning by +9 but Susan Collins also winning +9. That’s an 18 point difference! Maine has a penchant for bucking partisanship so it stays in the “fail” category. Here’s the updated map. It’s super close to the 2016 map where Clinton won the two-party popular vote 51.1% to Trump’s 48.9%. In 2016 Clinton won Maine but lost Michigan. Those flipped here and I’m assuming both would be very close.  I’m not going to attempt any complicated math to figure out how much the approve vote would change by losing Maine but gaining Michigan. Michigan had about 5 million votes cast in 2020 while Maine only had 800000 so I’m confident any losses by a few points in Maine would be made up by a narrow victory for Team Approve in Michigan. All in all this shakes out to a 50.5% - 51% approval of the referendum. I think the most likely scenario is a narrow victory for “approve” that is closely tied to the results of the last two presidential elections.  Conclusions Maybe I am being too pessimistic and Nevada and Maine were just bad examples. Both are oddly unrepresentative states: Maine for ticket-splitting and Nevada for it’s less educated Democratic electorate. Maybe the map looks more like 2020 where Team Approve is able to gain Wisconsin Pennsylvania Georgia and Arizona. Maybe it’s a blue wave where Florida and North Carolina also vote approve. Here’s what that would like like.   (FYI I made this third map after 270toWin updated their data with the new 2020 Census estimates so the electoral votes don’t match up with the last two) Still that would only net a few points nationally to approve’s totals because the vote is going to be close in every state. You could end up with something like a 59%-60% result. But that’s still nowhere near 85% or 95% like some polls show. The main point here is that gun control referenda are difficult to pass. Activists have been able to use the referendum laws in some red states to get around Republican legislatures that won’t act on issues supported by majorities of the public. In this case that doesn’t seem like it would work all that well. Additionally even when voters in red states do pass referenda the courts sometimes get involved and overturn the will of the people. My point in doing this is to demonstrate that any meaningful change in gun laws probably needs to come from Congress. State by state action would be an uphill climb and you’re very unlikely to get anything passed in redder states like Indiana. Finally remember that polls have performed pretty well in some other referendum scenarios. Guns just seem to be different. While there are always caveats to comparing polling to vote choice I don’t think it’s fair to say that the 2016 Maine referendum failure proves that issue polling is bunk. What do you think? Am I being too much of a doomer? Or am I too optimistic? Let me know how you think this would play out.
