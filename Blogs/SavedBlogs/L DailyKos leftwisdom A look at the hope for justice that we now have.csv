L, A look at the hope for justice that we now have, leftwisdom, 2021-06-29, New York both the city and the state are looking at rendering indictments this week against the Trump Organizations. The reason for this is that the organization headed by the former president has a long history of “selectly” reporting the value of its properties. When it comes time to count wealth the property is worth a lot. However when it is time to pay taxes somehow the value is little or nothing. That creates at least the impression that they are playing games with their worth in order to shortchange the city state and federal government on taxes. Right now in the first round the report is that they are not coming after the head of the snake himself. Instead they are going after Wasselberg and other officers who are strongly suspected of special illegal perks. However we have seen Michael Cohen do the intelligent thing and flip to try and redeem his image and his soul I might add. He admits to being a part of the illegal enterprises but indicates that he regrets it and vows to do better. I take a very careful look at that. I wouldn’t automatically trust him but I would trust him before I would trump himself any day of the week. Michael is adamant that likely Wasselberg and others are going to flip because the truth always has a way of coming out. He is elderly himself and is not going to want to go to jail especially if the person directing his actions doesn’t as well. Why would he be “loyal” to a person who has no loyalty to anybody or anything? It makes absolute sense that Wasselberg will flip at some point and then trump will be in court himself. And that will be a day that will do America proud. People want unity but we can’t have unity as long as 30 percent give or take of the population are seriously advocating for an overthrow of the legally established Presidency. Trump can not be allowed to continue to try to steal the election. We will never really be in any version of “unity” until that refusal to face reality is over. Here is an interview with Michael Cohen. Here’s also hoping he is right on every single point. Oh and am concerned that Trump might not get to keep some of his ill-gotten gains….heck no. www.theguardian.com/...
