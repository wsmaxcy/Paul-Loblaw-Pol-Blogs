L, Museum Pieces: Bethlehem PA and the Fries Rebellion, Lenny FlankforHistory for Kossacks, 2021-07-06, “Historic Bethlehem” is a collection of restored and refurbished historical buildings in Bethlehem PA. One of these is the Sun Inn which figured prominently in the anti-tax Fries Rebellion.   "Museum Pieces" is a diary series that explores the history behind some of the most interesting museum exhibits and historical places. In 1798 the United States Government needed money in a hurry. Political conflicts with France had resulted in a series of naval skirmishes that came to be known as the “Quasi War” and the US needed to expand its armed forces in case things turned into a real shooting war. So in July 1798 Congress at the urging of President John Adams passed $2 million in new taxes. The new tax was to be collected according to the value of property held by each individual. For most of the wealthy plantation owners and planters this meant that the assessment was based on the number of slaves they owned. For those who did not own slaves the assessment was instead based on the value of their house and land. Tax collectors began visiting towns to assess taxes. They also at the same time began counting the windows in each home—which was not a part of the new tax but which convinced many that it would lead to a future tax based on the amount of glass in each house. This requirement was quickly repealed. The new tax provoked opposition particularly in the rural farming communities of southeast Pennsylvania. These were largely composed of German immigrants some of them descendants of Hessian mercenaries who had remained in the US after the Revolutionary War. They were known inaccurately as “Pennsylvania Dutch”. Not only did they view the “House Tax” as unfairly assessed but they did not particularly like the idea of the Federal Government collecting taxes. Just a decade earlier anti-tax farmers in western Pennsylvania had exploded in the Whiskey Rebellion which had been put down by armed troops. That spirit of rebellion still smoldered. Pennsylvania Dutch farmers refused to pay the tax. When tax assessors tried to place a value on their farmhouses housewives would pour hot water onto them from the second floor windows. In many towns gatherings were held which raised “liberty poles” and when government officials tried to hold town meetings to explain the purpose behind the tax they were met by jeering protestors dressed in Continental army uniforms. Many tax assessors were intimidated into resigning. Opposition to the tax was especially heavy in the town of Milford where John Fries emerged as the rebellion’s leader. A barrelmaker by training Fries was also the local auctioneer who had served as a captain in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and had been part of the state militia force that had put down the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Now he led a band of around 60 armed “militia” who marched around town preventing tax assessors from collecting the tax. Similar armed groups appeared in Northampton Township and Millarstown (the modern town of Macungie). Federal judges in Philadelphia issued arrest warrants for dozens of tax protestors and in February 1799 US Marshall William Nichols was sent to Northampton County to serve them arriving on March 1. He arrested several dozen and confined them in the Sun Inn in the city of Bethlehem. Now things moved quickly. On March 5 Fries took a group of armed protestors to Quakertown intending to arrest the tax assessors there. After warning them not to attempt any further collections Fries returned to Milford and learning of the arrests in Northampton County set out for Bethlehem. There he was joined by another group of protestors from Millarstown and Northampton and soon the Sun Inn was surrounded by 400 armed rebels who demanded the arrested prisoners be released. According to later witnesses Fries made a speech declaring “I tell you brothers we have to pass four or five sentries but I beg you not to fire first upon them till they first fire upon us. I expect I shall be the foremost man I shall go on before you and I expect I shall get the first blow”. Nichols hoping to avoid an armed confrontation agreed to release them on bail on condition that they appear for trial in Philadelphia. Fries and his men returned to Milford. Meanwhile Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin had already dispatched state militia troops from Reading to Milford and on March 25 the Adams Administration sent Federal troops from Philadelphia. By April 20 they had arrested 31 of the insurgents including Fries and taken them back to Philadelphia. The rebellion fizzled out after that. As the accused ringleader John Fries was tried first appearing in the Federal District Court (now the Old City Hall) on April 30. The trial was presided over by Supreme Court Justice James Iredell. The prosecutors charged Fries and four others with treason arguing that by forming an armed group that actively opposed the Government he had in effect declared war on the United States. They also charged the defendants with various offenses under the new Alien and Sedition Acts which had been introduced by the Federalist Party in Congress with the support of the Adams Administration as a way of curtailing the opposition of the Democratic-Republican Party. This was a time of political polarization and hyper-partisanship. Both the Federalists headed by Adams and the Democratic-Republicans led by Jefferson viewed each other not as mere political opponents but as traitorous enemies who would destroy the country if allowed into power. Adams in particular was prone to sheer paranoia—he viewed any criticism of his policies or his party as not simple political disagreement but as anti-American treason. And in his mind it was foreign interests—especially France—that had to lay behind any political opposition. The new laws not only restricted the rights of immigrants but also empowered the President to deport them at will if it were in the “national interest”. The Sedition Act went even further and made it a crime for anyone to criticize US Government leaders or to challenge their actions. A number of Democratic-Republican newspapers who editorialized against Adams had already been shut down under the Acts. Fries was found guilty after a sensational trial and on May 9 was sentenced to death. Then just a week later a mistrial was declared when it was discovered that one of the jurors had told a friend before the trial was over that he wanted to see Fries hanged. A new trial was ordered. The retrial began on April 16 1800 this time with Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase presiding. Like the earlier trial this one devolved into a partisan argument that divided people along ideological lines. As the trial began Fries lawyers quit to protest what they viewed as political bias from the judge. Fries then acted as his own attorney and based his defense on the argument that his actions while perhaps illegal did not constitute “treason” as defined in the Constitution. Justice Chase a Federalist pre-empted a portion of Fries’ defense by issuing a jury instruction which upheld the prosecution’s definition of “treason”. Fries was once again convicted and sentenced with two others to be hanged on May 23 but two days before the execution they were pardoned by President Adams who was suffering from political troubles that were partly brought on by his own harsh partisan actions (including the Alien and Sedition Acts) and who wanted to put the whole Tax Rebellion behind. It didn’t help him:  Adams and the Federalist Party lost a crushing defeat in the 1800 elections. The Sedition Acts were declared unconstitutional and everyone who had been arrested under their provisions was released. In 1804 the US House of Representatives unsuccessfully tried to remove Supreme Court Justice Chase citing his partisan rulings in the Fries trial as part of their articles of impeachment. Today the Sun Inn is one of the oldest existing buildings in Bethlehem. NOTE: As some of you already know all of my diaries here are draft chapters for a number of books I am working on.
