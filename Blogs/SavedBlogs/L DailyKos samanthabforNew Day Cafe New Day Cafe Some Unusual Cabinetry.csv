L, New Day Cafe: Some Unusual Cabinetry, samanthabforNew Day Cafe, 2021-05-10,  Today I look at some unique cabinetry.   Great craftsmanship this. Not Art Nouveau or Art Deco but nevertheless very nice. A wooden cabinet with a total of 320 drawers from the early 1900's from Lucerne Switzerland. pic.twitter.com/njzuzGmesj A post shared by Nuvintage (@nuvintage_furniture)  A post shared by SPACE (@hangingspace)     Grab a cup of coffee and share what’s on your mind this morning.
