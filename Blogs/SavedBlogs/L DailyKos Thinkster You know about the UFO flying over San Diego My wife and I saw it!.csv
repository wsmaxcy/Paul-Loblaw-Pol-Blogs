L, You know about the "UFO" flying over San Diego? My wife and I saw it!, Thinkster, 2021-04-19, There’s been plenty of reporting of the “UFO” flying over San Diego. I saw it. It flew across the sky while my wife and I were outside in the spa (nope — no drinking or smoking). What did I see? Coming from the Northeast from the direction of Edwards AFB Area 51 and Nellis AFB in L.V. it was flying south (yes towards San Diego). As it flew across the sky several things were immediately apparent. First it was very fast and flying at about 5000 ft. (estimated). There were lots of airliners and private jets in the sky — none of them were anywhere near it. It scooted across the sky and right in front of us it started to climb — very very quickly. Then within a couple of seconds it was gone — straight up. It did this over the San Fernando Valley. It didn’t have the usual jet exhaust I would expect from a military fighter — I’ve never seen anything like it. It was white dim and fuzzy — clustered around and obscuring the rear of the aircraft. What little I could see of the aircraft was mainly a pointed nose and the shape of an arrow — till it disappeared into the exhaust plume. Here’s the best part — It never made a sound. Nothing even as it flew straight up and disappeared into a clear sky (I could see airliners behind it). As far as I can tell — I saw what the Navy saw and what San Diego eventually saw. I’m in Santa Clarita North of L.A. 20 miles. That’s what my wife and I saw (and did not hear!). What do you think? Here’s the video — nypost.com/… it loads slowly — sorry about the source.
