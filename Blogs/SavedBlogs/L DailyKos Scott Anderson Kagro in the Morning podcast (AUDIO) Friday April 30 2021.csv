L, Kagro in the Morning podcast (AUDIO): Friday April 30 2021, Scott Anderson, 2021-04-30,  Radio Public|LibSyn|YouTube|Patreon|Square Cash (Share code: Send $5 get $5!) Shortage on staff due to my dental problems Greg’s computer problems and Joan’s —  well Joan has less problems than usual since she is on vacation —  left the titan of our World Headquarters David Waldman shouldering full KITM responsibilities. Only one thing could lead him back out of an early retirement schadenfreude: Remember Donald Trump’s first impeachment? Rudy Colludy Giuliani is set to reminisce with FBI agents about Ukraine and what he might have done on behalf of his now private citizen boss. William Barr isn’t around anymore as he is planning a book tour probably to somewhere that won’t extradite him. The FBI warned Giuliani and even bigger Russian tool Ron Johnson that they were heading for trouble but who would listen to what the FBI says anyhow? Expect to see other warriors against the Deep State return to the headlines soon. Donald Trump’s son Matt Gaetz — well Matt is “like a son” to Donald — was having sex with a girl who was like a son to Matt... or at least the age of the guy that’s like a son to him. The problem for Gaetz is that Matt’s pimp unfortunately for Matt is still alive and Matt’s mack daddy buddy Joel Greenberg drafted a confession letter with Roger Stone and God as one does.  Shine a UV light on anything in Trump’s orbit and you risk blindness... lucky for the “auditors” in Arizona they won’t be finding much evidence of Trump in their searches. A Trump vote will be as rare as an antifa raid on the Cyber Ninjas. Of course what everyone there is really looking for is money and they will find plenty. “Trump in heels” — well one of them anyhow — Amanda Chase found a man to chase in rage on the highway but passed the gun and the blame to one of her aides just like a Trump. Senator Tom Cotton will try to pull a procedure to throw a wrench into government and it won’t be long before he friends try the same trick.
