L, J.D. Vance's Ohio Senate Campaign Gets Off To Awkward Start, David Moye, 2021-07-02, It’s too early to write an elegy over J.D. Vance’s Ohio Senate campaign but the “Hillbilly Elegy” author’s announcement on Thursday was definitely awkward. Vance is competing in the Republican primary for the seat currently held by Sen. Rob Portman (R). His opponents include former state Treasurer Josh Mandel former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken and business executives Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons. To prove he’s the right person for the job Vance presumably wanted a campaign announcement that went off without a hitch. If only the campaign sign on his lectern had gotten the memo. Instead it fell off right when he was about to declare his candidacy. Just as JD Vance was about to officially declare his candidacy for US Senate his campaign sign fell off the lectern pic.twitter.com/5pqsikBdML Many Twitter users saw the falling campaign sign as sending a very specific message. there's a metaphor in there somewhere https://t.co/oq33RYDX70 Even the sign fell asleep. Please leave Ohio alone Vance. We don't need you. https://t.co/3PE8Z5oKKw the sign knew what was coming and noped the fuck out https://t.co/XcrjW8dUDh Some had questions.  Does this country need infrastructure spending or what https://t.co/mReTqpf2n3 does that sign have bootstraps it can pull itself up with https://t.co/iHQWqJFune Others had jokes.  Today is Larry David’s birthday. Somebody please edit the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme into this. Do it for Larry and for your country. https://t.co/obyODfzehq The video cuts off before it happened but just after this he stepped in a paint can and got it caught on his foot then his pants fell down and he dropped one small little turd back into his pants https://t.co/t9BU0TuQyd But the sign mishap wasn’t the only awkward thing to happen to Vance since officially declaring his candidacy. CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski noted the many tweets Vance has deleted ― like one where he called former President Donald Trump “reprehensible” ― so that Ohio Republicans won’t see them. JD Vance deleted his tweet about voting for Evan McMullin.It was here: https://t.co/4k1Xk8AMgvBut still can be viewed on the WebArchive.https://t.co/uLcCLkbur3 pic.twitter.com/LNofBemmsL Deleted from the day of Access Hollywood "Lord help us." pic.twitter.com/5ooexbNUhn Here's another deleted one pic.twitter.com/PqCm4GNpR1
