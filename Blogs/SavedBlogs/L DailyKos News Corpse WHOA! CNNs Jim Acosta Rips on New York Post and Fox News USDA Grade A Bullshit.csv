L, WHOA! CNN's Jim Acosta Rips on New York Post and Fox News: USDA Grade A Bullshit, News Corpse, 2021-05-01, Here's something you don't see every day. Anchoring CNN's Saturday Newsroom Jim Acosta reported on the debunked and ridiculed story that the children's book - Superheroes Are Everywhere - by Vice-President Kamala Harris was given to every migrant child who arrived at border detention facilities. Acosta's take on the easily disproven story was an epic smackdown of the fake news purveyors that included the New York Post and Fox News. It was a thing of beauty: "From there the lie kept spreading. Prominent Republicans like House Minority Whip Steve Scalise who suggested the Vice-President was profiting off the problems at the border. His tweet is still up."  Acosta: This was USDA Grade A bullshit and the reporter who wrote the story resigned... but the damage was done pumped out over the airwaves at the bullshit factory also known as Fox News pic.twitter.com/1j2GDOVlwJ  The story of course wasn't true. There was a single book received among donations to help the kids by members of the community. But that didn't stop the right-wing fabulists intent on manufacturing fake scandals from jumping on the phony allegation and disseminating it to their fact-averse followers. Numerous high-ranking politicos regurgitated the flagrant falsehood. And their tweets also still remain online. They include GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy GOP Party Chair Ronna McDaniel Sen. Tom Cotton Rep. Jim Jordan to name just a few. The New York Post deleted the original story and then replaced it with another version that said that "Kamala isn’t at the southern border — but at least one migrant kid got Veep’s book." The new version which changed little more than the headline was also attributed to the original author despite her having resigned amid complaints that she was forced to write the false article. The tweet to which Acosta was referring is one that Scalise posted with a video of Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki. She was responding to a question from Peter Doocy of Fox News who asked whether Harris "was making any money" off of the book's distribution that never happened. Scalise asked in his tweet if "Kamala Harris [is] profiting off the border crisis?" No she wasn't. And yes it's still there: WATCH → White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki dodges and says "I hear it's a good book" when asked if Kamala Harris is making money off her book being handed out at border facilities.Is Kamala Harris profiting off the border crisis?Americans deserve to know. pic.twitter.com/TAdBs7IdM6  It's satisfying to see the more conventional news networks speaking truthfully about the blatant dishonesty of Rupert Murdoch's propaganda enterprises. They are the most prominent and prolific source of disinformation and they present an imminent danger to democracy and America. It's long past time that they be treated by legitimate journalists as the right-wing domestic terror PR agency. Because that is what they are.
