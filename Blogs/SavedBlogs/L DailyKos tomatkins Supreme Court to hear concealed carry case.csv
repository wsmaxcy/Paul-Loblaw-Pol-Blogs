L, Supreme Court to hear concealed carry case, tomatkins, 2021-04-26, I’m basically just gonna leave this Tweet. But my assumption here is — the court will once again affirm that the founders REALLY meant the 2nd amendment to be about self-defense not community defense. When that ruling comes I expect it will largely eviscerate what’s left of state level gun control measures.  BREAKING: The Supreme Court agrees to take up a major gun rights case. In NY State Rifle & Pistol Assoc. v. Corlett the justices will consider the extent to which the Second Amendment protects the right to carry guns outside the home for self-defense. pic.twitter.com/0uGurWn46r
