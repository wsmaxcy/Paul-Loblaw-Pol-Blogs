L, Anti-Capitalist Meetup: Mother Said Share, greenandblueforAnti-Capitalist Meetup, 2021-05-09, Happy Mother’s day. May all domestic caregivers be fully and fairly compensated in a system that doesn’t make you sacrifice the career you made outside of your home. Today I am writing about sharing with two examples from international business and politics Covid vaccination and semiconductor manufacturing. Treating them as profit-driven private enterprises is leading to trouble. Let’s start with the easier one. Covid vaccine distribution Six months after India and South Africa called for waiving intellectual property (IP) rights over COVID-19 vaccines and after only 0.2% of the first billion COVID-19 vaccines went to low income countries the Biden administration has belatedly backed temporarily waiving intellectual property rights for this crucial step in overcoming this deadly coronavirus.  Arguments in favor of this waiver are that the IP holders cannot make enough on their own to vaccinate on the scale we need and that pharmaceuticals have moved enough manufacturing of numerous products to developing countries so that the people in these countries can make up the observed shortfall in COVID-19 vaccination with their own production. Opposing arguments say are that IP holders are already cooperating for maximum distribution and that existing facilities built for other pharmaceutical manufacturing are not prepared to make these mRNA vaccines. European powers remain divided over the IP waiver with the Merkel administration maintaining that intellectual property is vital for future innovation. I frequently ask on the ACM if private property is necessary for innovation. Is the Merkel administration argument valid? My overall opinion of COVID-19 is that we will see who is more agile us or these coronaviruses. Last year we learned about epidemiology and logistic growth. The time to contain COVID-19 was early but we failed thanks in part to the previous US administration prioritizing perception over reality. Now that COVID-19 is uncontained we are learning about selection. Vaccines put selection pressure on the virus. Meanwhile COVID-19 is propagating away mutating and recombining in unvaccinated populations. We have an urgent need to fully vaccinate and stop this virus before it evolves vaccine resistance and even more deadly variants. We need to flood the globe with vaccines to stop propagation of this virus before we select new variants that cause us more problems. Arguing over IP is not helping. IP waivers should have been issued months ago so that we can see how much vaccine manufacturing capacity can be increased with oversight and inspections in place to ensure consistent production of safe and effective vaccine. We stifle ourselves and risk biological catastrophe by relying on IP holders to make all of our vaccine for us. Semiconductor manufacturing Yes vaccine IP was the easy subject for today. Now let’s talk about high end manufacturing. About the time we at the ACM were visualizing a better world 60 minutes aired a segment on the fragile supplies of the most advanced semiconductors.  In a world of competition high end is not enough. Companies and countries spend billions seeking marginal competitive edges that lead to global dominance in technology finance and defense. In technology extreme measures are taken to make consistent chips with nanometer scaled circuits. It has turned out that the most advanced semiconductors are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) based in Hsinchu Taiwan. Shrinking circuits to nanometer scales beyond the reach of other manufactures has led to TSMC domination. It takes many billions of dollars to research and build such manufacturing. Once achieved that manufacturing supplies all sorts of technologies from consumer goods to the most advanced military equipment. In this way semiconductors are a key technology. Whoever controls the most advanced manufacturing of semiconductors also gains a economic and military advantages and exerts extraordinary influence on technology worldwide. The People’s Republic of China has always wanted to take back the Republic of China (Taiwan). Perhaps it’s unrelated but now with the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan China is in the midst of increasing maneuvers around Taiwan and advancing claims in the South China / West Philippines Sea. Whether coincidence or part of the plan controlling territory that happens to house the most advanced chip manufacturing provides advantages for the occupying power. This would not be a problem if we had equitable distribution in a world free of national strategic interests. But even given current nation state circumstances is private ownership of the most advanced manufacturing capabilities deepening rifts? If the IP held by TSMC was available to all who could afford the steep investment costs and where should such manufacturing be located? Ideally such decisions would be made for the best of humanity not for national and financial interests. But how do we get there? Can we simply make semiconductor IP freely available to all? Any nation that spurns IP will be shunned by other countries. Even China with its massive markets and IP theft tries to act like it respects IP. Countries that don’t play along with IP lose chances to participate in world trade. Intellectual property is just the start. Building state of the art semiconductor manufacturing requires uncommon expertise and tremendous resource allocation. Where should we build these plants? Are individual companies and countries left to build on their own? The most efficient and least controversial distribution of semiconductor manufacturing will arise free of national interests or IP profiting. But again how do we get there? No nation will voluntarily give up its existence for the good of all. Any nation that continues to exist has to abide by the current standards of international trade and IP. The presence of the most advanced chip manufacturing in disputed territory exacerbates tensions. It seems that we would be better off if the manufacturing of critical material could be determined free of national and IP interests. However the first steps towards a more equitable and sustainable solution remain elusive. We know we need to share. National and IP interests often discourage sharing. Where should we confront those interests to effectively catalyze the transitions we need to make.
