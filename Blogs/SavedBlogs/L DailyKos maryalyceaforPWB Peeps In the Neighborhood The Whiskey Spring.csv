Riley had some property along Lake Au Revoir with about half a dozen little cabins that he rented out to hunters and fishermen. Jake went out there every year about the first week in November for the 'coon hunting and he was just scouting around on Saturday when he found what he thought was a pond. It looked at first like the kind of pond you find all over in the woods—the kind that stays still and has cattails around it and maybe some day lilies and sometimes draws a few ducks in the spring and fall. Except that this pond was only about eighteen inches across and didn't have anything around it for another three feet or so but just bare dirt.  “Funny” Jake said to himself. When he looked closer he saw the pond had some little bubbles coming up in the middle of it. A spring Jake thought.  But it was a funny color for a spring—kind of amber. So Jake took a long stick and poked it into the center of this puddle-sized pond or spring or whatever and the stick went down and down and pretty soon his hand was almost in the whatever and he hadn't reached anything with the stick. Whatever kind of water that is he thought there's plenty of it. Then he noticed the smell of the stuff and it seemed pretty familiar. “Aw it can't be” he said. But he dipped a finger in and took one little lick. “Good grief” he said and this time he cupped his hand and scooped up about an ounce of the stuff. “That's gotta be the best bourbon there is” he said. “I bet nobody's bothered this stuff in fifteen years.” And he looked around again and saw that all the trees anywhere near the spring were oaks even though the rest of the woods was mostly pine and birch. “Son of a gun” he said. “Natural aging too.” Now Jake had been saying for a lot of years that if he had it to do over again he'd be a bootlegger. He figured that whiskey being what it was—a necessity of life—there had to be a good living in it if you could find a way to bypass the State and the Federal and the City who were known for wanting their cut. “Besides” he used to say “there's the pride of dealing in a quality product. And it would be quality too” he would say. “I wouldn't be turning out the kind of drain cleaner you wouldn't give to some shave-headed Proud Baby. Oh no. A man's got to have some integrity.” Then there was the glamour but Jake wouldn't have admitted that. He would just look around the basement mentally placing the still and the vents and the kegs and the bottle racks and sigh over the fact that in the city his operation would be secret for about two weeks what with the vapors and the trucks coming and going. Riley had once said “Why don't you get yourself a van and put ‘Jake's Plumbing’ on the side of it?” Jake thought about that but then he said “And what if somebody calls up and wants me to do some plumbing? I don't know from cheddar about pipes unless they're siphons.” So he just kept on sighing until the day he found the spring. Now Jake was thinking fast. First there was the problem of what to tell Riley. He got over that one right away. Riley didn't need to know Jake decided. Would Riley even care? Jake asked himself. He was more of a beer type anyway. As to the other problems all Jake figured he needed was his pickup full of kegs and a siphon and a funnel but one more look around showed him he couldn't get the pickup in anywhere near the spring. So he paced off the distance to the dirt road that went from Riley's place to the State highway. It was about fifty yards. Heck he thought all I need is enough garden hose. It took some driving around because naturally he didn't want to buy all the stuff in the same place but he got everything together. He had to drive all the way home for the kegs and a tarpaulin to cover them up with but he figured “Heck this stuff would go for forty bucks a quart easy with the taxes. I can sell it for twenty all profit and sell out in no time and come back for more. What's some extra gas when you've got it made otherwise?” He got back to the spring just about dark laid out the hose and covered it with brush and had his siphon going before the 'coon hunters started to drift out of Riley's cabins. Then he stayed close to the pickup and kept quiet. The rest of the night all he had to do was switch the hose and the funnel when a keg got full. He filled four kegs and a jug—the jug was in case he had a personal emergency—then he packed his gear in the pickup put the tarp over it and went back to his cabin. In the morning he told Riley he'd had a great night and asked if he could rent the same cabin again the next weekend and maybe the next too and maybe pretty often during the rest of the hunting season. Riley scratched his head a bit over that one because in living memory nobody had ever bagged anything on his property but he said “Sure.” Jake felt a little guilty about not saying any more but he took a deep breath and overcame it. He figured to deal in a product especially top-of-the-line stuff like this you had to be able to appreciate it yourself and Riley had even been known to drink light beer. Besides put enough light beers in him and who knew what he'd start to talk about? He did make Riley charge him full price for the cabin. Riley gulped but he said “Okay.” By the end of the 'coon season Jake had his basement full of kegs and bottles and he'd dropped his hauling business. The price of his product had gone from twenty to twenty-five dollars a quart and sometimes people winced at that but if anybody groused he'd just say “Taste it.” Most people bought a couple of quarts right away after that. By spring though he was getting low on his stock and he started thinking about heading back to  Riley's when the fishing started. The fishing at Riley's was just as lousy as the hunting but that didn't mean Riley wouldn't rent him the cabin. A man's got to live. But Jake thought he'd take a ride out there early just to make sure of his source of supply. He found the spot again all right having had lots of practice and then he thought he might just as well fill the keg he had empty in the pickup since there didn't seem to be anybody around. He got the hose set to run over to the spring and then he got out the siphon. But when he was within a few yards of the spring he had to stop because rolling around in the dirt right at the spring were three black bears. What the—Jake thought but then he took a harder look at the bears and he could see by their eyes they had been there long enough to have an informed opinion of his product. “You couldn't go down by the lake for a drink could you?” said Jake. “Or you couldn't enjoy in moderation.” Then one of the bears put his paws up on a stump and dragged his hind legs approximately straight. “Disgusting” said Jake.” Mmmmmrrrawk” said the bear looking right at him. Jake figured maybe he'd better come back after happy hour was over so he turned around and right behind him was a game warden. “Saw your truck on the shoulder” said the warden. “You got trouble with it?” ‘No” said Jake. “I ah was gonna do some hiking but ah—“ He was just about to point out the bears when he saw the warden looking at the hose. “What's going on here?” said the warden. “Well” said Jake and then the warden saw the bears.  “Mmmmmrrrawk” said the bear on the stump. “Ummmphh” said another one. The third one was lying perfectly still on his back with his legs in four different directions. “Hey!” said the warden. “You poison those bears?” “Me?” said Jake. And he dropped the hose and ran like a crazed chipmunk back to the pickup with the warden a lucky five yards behind him. Well he got out and he got home and after a few days he figured if the warden had his license number he'd have heard about it by now. Also it was about time for Riley to be opening up again so he called him about the cabin and the fishing. “Well ah yeah” Riley said. “Fishing I got. The lake's all right. Maybe no hiking or hunting for quite a while though.” “What do you mean?” said Jake. ‘Well” said Riley “seems I got a polluted spring on the property. I don't know what the hell's in it or how it got there but they tell me I got to have clean-up done because it could poison animals. There's a bulldozer coming next week and some trees are coming down too.” “Geez” said Jake. “Sounds expensive.” “Oh it's not as bad as it might be” said Riley. “The trees coming down are oaks. I didn't even know I had oaks but these are real big ones and some guy is gonna buy 'em for furniture.” Did you know they got machines now can slice veneer practically thin as cardboard? And these suckers are worth a fortune for that and –“ But Jake wasn't listening any more.
