L, Liberals wanted to cancel GitHub because of the master branch, Alonso del Arte, 2021-06-28, If more Trumpists knew about Git and GitHub Tucker Carlson would have been bellowing about how overly woke liberals want to cancel GitHub because of a little detail that could be interpreted as supporting slavery. Still the Fox News white supremacist has plenty of material for stoking outrage with “Mr.” Potato Head the Dr. Seuss books and kissing unconscious Disney princesses. Last year the Microsoft-owned GitHub made a change to allow users to make a certain  change of terminology in their files stored on GitHub. Or as the racist Carlson would probably have put it Microsoft caved to the “woke mob” to avoid getting “canceled.” Although probably more Daily Kos readers know about Git and GitHub than people who get all their news from Fox “News” I should still take a few paragraphs to explain what Git and GitHub are. After all even the writers of Silicon Valley seem to be completely ignorant about those (see the Season 1 episode “Third Party Insourcing”). Anyone who’s written a computer program more involved than Hello World knows that computer programs seldom work correctly the very first time. You have to make changes from your first drafts to get programs to work correctly or at all. But that sometimes means that you screw something up and then you need to go back to an earlier version of the program generally not the first but definitely not the current one. That’s where version control software comes in. It’s true that Git adds its own complexity to a project. But for the vast majority of projects the benefits of Git outweigh the disadvantages. The files needed for a particular project are grouped into a repository that can be handled as a single unit. Git is mostly used on the command line to coordinate a repository on a local computer and that same repository on the main remote source which is generally the website GitHub.com. So you make changes to your program on your local machine and at appropriate intervals you “commit” and “push” those changes to the remote repository. You can put the project on a different computer and revert to an earlier version of the repository even if that version has never existed on the other computer. Git sure sounds like a good thing what silly problem could a woke liberal possibly have with that? The default name for the principal branch in a repository. In addition to keeping track of chronological versions of a project Git also allows you to maintain separate branches of a repository. You could for example have a branch called “dev” that you use for development and another one called “deploy” that you use to deploy your program for use by the general public. If you like the changes in the dev branch enough to release them to the general public you do a “merge” or a “pull” from the dev branch to the deploy branch. If not you might revert the dev branch while the deploy branch continues to serve up the tried and true version of your program to the public. Obviously there has to be a principal branch. And for almost all of Git’s existence that branch has been called “master” by default. As far as I know GitHub has never advised anyone to have a corresponding “slave” branch in their repositories. Still the use of those terms is quite prevalent in tech and some Git users might think that was the reason for the term “master” on Git. Elizabeth Landau for Wired last year: The words master and slave have been widely used for decades in computing and other technical contexts as a reference to situations where one process or entity controls another. Sometimes the metaphor is less precise: A "master" may simply lead serve as a primary resource or be considered first. Since 1976 the US has issued more than 67000 patents using the terms from an antenna system to a data-encoding method to a “vehicle ramp assembly.” Now the Black Lives Matter movement is prompting renewed scrutiny of diversity and equity in tech—including its vocabulary. Microsoft’s GitHub a popular software-development platform with 50 million users will replace the word master as the default branch name for new repositories a spokesperson says. GitHub is also making it easy for users to choose their own default branch name when creating a new repository and is releasing guidance to rename existing ones the spokesperson says. There’s never been a complementary use of slave in GitHub’s repository architecture. Even so some black programmers might object to the term while others might consider making the change of terminology an extremely low priority compared to ending racial discrimination for education employment housing law enforcement etc. Some even consider it worthless empty symbolism. A couple of links that got mangled in the copying and pasting so I removed them; they’re available from Wired. Dwayne Slater a developer in San Jose is one of more than 3000 people who signed a petition opposing GitHub dropping the word master. The petition calls such moves “distractions not solutions” and says it “creates confusion and unnecessary work for developers.” Slater who is Black wrote in the comments “To see GitHub use the color of my skin to make meaningless change is a slap in the face. There are more useful causes to bring to attention words are not the issue police brutality in the United States is the issue.” In an interview Slater says he supports replacing the word slave where it’s still used. But on GitHub Slater is fine with master because he thought of it in the sense of a “master copy” or “mastering a craft” during more than six years of using Git. Another important issue is discrimination in hiring. A black programmer might be rejected for a developer job just because he’s not white (nor an Indian here on an H-1B visa). Such racist discrimination gets covered up with insulting explanations like that he was too fast or too slow at FizzBuzz (an extremely simple exercise that supposedly weeds out incompetent programmers but the results can easily fit a preconception about an applicant). Blacks are not monolithic and there are black programmers who think that the reexamination of commonly accepted terminology is a worthwhile first step in the march towards equality. Caroline Karanja in Minneapolis sees updating these terms as an important piece of the effort to create more inclusive spaces in tech. She is the founder of 26 Letters and the CEO of Hack the Gap two organizations aimed at equity and inclusion in tech. When she was teaching herself to code she thought the choice of the words master and slave was both odd and specific. “This didn’t have to be the language that we used” says Karanja who is Black. While learning Git she remembers struggling to figure out how to change the default “master” and she supports giving users an easy way to do so. Changing the principal branch name for existing repositories is not the simplest process but if you know the steps it’s quite easy though time-consuming if you have a lot of repositories to change. First though you need to make sure you have a recent version of Git. I have a payroll program as one of my Java projects. This program is not being used at any actual workplace. My purpose is to use snippets from the program as examples in a book I’m writing. I definitely don’t want the master-slave metaphor to come up in connection to that particular repository. I will use that payroll program to illustrate the steps for changing the principal branch name from “master” to “main.” At this point go the Branches setting on the GitHub.com settings page for your repository to change the default branch to the main branch. As far as I know there’s no way to do this step from the command line. The remaining steps can be done on the command line. I give much more detail on the technical aspects of this in a Medium article (it’s not on Medium Premium but hopefully it leads some to my Medium Premium articles). I intend to eventually change all my repositories in this way. It doesn’t solve racism but it has made me acknowledge that I have some automatic privilege. Not enough to fail upwards like certain real estate dumbasses but enough to turn a blind eye to many kinds of subtle racism that don’t affect me directly. Honestly although I had been aware of this terminology issue since at least 2018 I wasn’t spurred to act on it until this year when I noticed that the Git installation/upgrade wizard now gives you the option to select a default name for the principal branch other than “master.” Just because the term hasn’t made me uncomfortable is no excuse to simply dismiss the concerns people have out of hand. Or worse to go out of my way to celebrate that term while giving lame excuses like that “master” and “slave” are simply entrenched technical terms. Reexamining the terminology is a good first step. It needs to be followed by the step of making a pro-active effort by tech companies to hire more black people to positions of leadership or prestige and listen to what they have to say not just use them as tokens of diversity.
