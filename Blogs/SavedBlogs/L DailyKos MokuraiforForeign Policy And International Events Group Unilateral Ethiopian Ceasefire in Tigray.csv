L, Unilateral Ethiopian Ceasefire in Tigray, MokuraiforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-06-29, The Tigray region of Ethiopia has been a disaster area during nine months of civil war with all of the problems you would expect. The war is now officiually over to much rejoicing in the Tigrayan capital Mekelle and continuing consternation among aid agencies. We do not know what sort of political settlement will follow. Ethiopia's Tigray conflict: Unilateral ceasefire declared Ethiopia's government has declared a ceasefire in its war-torn Tigray region as rebel fighters claim control of the regional capital Mekelle. Residents reported scenes of jubilation with thousands of people in the streets waving flags and setting off fireworks. The Ethiopian government has not confirmed the loss of the city nearly eight months after its forces ousted the Tigrayan rebels. The conflict has pushed the region into a deep humanitarian crisis. More than five million people are in urgent need of food aid the United Nations says with 350000 facing famine. Or maybe it was a joint agreement. But between whom?  Whichever it is chaos reigns in the region and fighting continues here and there. Ethiopia has cut off Internet and telephone connections in Tigray and is not allowing food in. All sides are accused of atrocities.  Watch this space.
