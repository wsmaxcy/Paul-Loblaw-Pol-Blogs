L, Message from the Department of Defense: ‘You Jews Killed Jesus. Now Say You’re Sorry.’, ChrisRodda, 2021-04-27, In a no-holds-barred statement of anti-Semitism at the end of an article published by the Washington Headquarters Service of the Department of Defense for Easter this year a Navy chaplain gives his take on the crucifixion of Jesus — the Jews killed him and should apologize. In the article titled “What did the people talk about at the first Easter?” Chaplain (Lt.) Aristotle Rivera a graduate of West Point who is now a Navy chaplain serving on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune asks: “Did they talk about how loving God is or how God loves us unconditionally? Did they mention how God helps us through difficult times? Did the apostles go around inspiring others to remember Jesus and to follow his teachings? Did they gather in synagogues to discuss the ethical implications of loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you?” and Did Peter “give instruction about memorizing scripture verses going to church on Sundays being nice to people stop saying bad words and start being better people?” Hell no according to Chaplain Rivera. None of that namby-pamby modern Christian sentiment for the manly-man first Christians! Peter addressed the “Men of Israel” — a.k.a. the Jews — telling them: “you crucified and killed” Jesus. After quoting several verses from the second chapter of Acts Chaplain Rivera summarizes his interpretation of those verses addressed to the “Men of Israel” writing (emphasis added): “A way to summarize the early Easter message was this: ‘Jesus lived. You killed him. God raised him.  We saw him. Say Sorry.’” On behalf of 32 high-ranking military members and DoD civilian employees in the greater Washington D.C. area 24 of whom are Jewish who are understandably outraged at this blatant anti-Semitism purveyed by the Department of Defense’s Washington Headquarters Service Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) founder and president Mikey Weinstein has sent the following email to Regina F. Meiners the acting director of the Washington Headquarters Service demanding that rather than an apology from the Jews for killing Jesus the Washington Headquarters Service apologize for condoning and spreading Chaplain Rivera’s anti-Semitic poison.

MeinersActing DirectorDepartment of DefenseWashington Headquarters Service Dear Ms. Meiners Please see this despicable article that was published on March 30 2021 under YOUR authority as the Acting Director of the DoD Washington Headquarters Service: https://www.whs.mil/News/News-Display/Article/2556111/what-did-the-people-talk-about-at-the-first-easter The  Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) is representing 32 Washington D.C.-area military and civilian DoD members 24 of whom are Jewish regarding this defamatory outrage published under your clear authority. As America still reels on a daily basis from the horrific shock of extremist hate from every corner of our Land now comes this stunningly antisemitic article printed not even a month ago in apparent celebration of Easter by the official Department of Defense (DoD) Washington Headquarters Service. This putrid filth spewing and egging on the basic foundations of the ancient hated of the Jewish people as “Christ Killers” is simply one of the most antisemitic Old School Jew-baiting pieces of defamatory trash we have seen here at MRFF in a very long time. Yet once again the Mother Ship of fundamentalist Christianity rears its repugnant head this time in an official DoD Headquarters internet publication written by a United States Navy officer/chaplain for ALL the world to see. And what is its main filthy theme or thesis? It is quite literally to SOLELY blame the Jewish people (”Men of Israel”) for the gruesome execution of Jesus Christ on the cross. Ms. Meiners this wretched screed is absolutely base evil vile hateful bigotry and rapacious racism being vomited out of the mouth of this U.S. military officer/chaplain/author and fully endorsed by your official high profile DoD news and information outlet the DoD’s Washington Headquarters Service. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation demands that U.S. Navy Chaplain (Lt.) Rivera who is also a West Point graduate and anyone else who is either directly or indirectly responsible for this mind-blowing dishonorable and malevolent publishing of abject prejudice be aggressively investigated and visibly punished with immediate due swiftness by the Department of Defense. Additionally MRFF further demands an immediate and heartfelt apology in writing from the DoD’s Washington Headquarters Service which you currently direct and oversee.
