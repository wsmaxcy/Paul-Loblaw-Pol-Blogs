L, Trevor Noah Speaks Truth On Policing: No 'Bad Apples' A 'Rotten Tree', Frances Langum, 04-15-21, Leave it to the comedians to tell the brutal truth.  Trevor Noah looked straight into his phone camera yesterday and told the truth about racism and policing.   The "System" is about cops killing Black men.  Terrorizing Black men at traffic stops.  Making Black life NOT matter.  It's a system and it is working exactly as it has been designed to work.   There are not "bad apples" in the police "system" it is a rotten tree that occasionally produces good apples.   Listen. @Trevornoah is his most brilliant when he's most serious. — Jo-Anne Pollock (@Pollock1953Jo) April 14 2021 Trevor this brought me to tears. I can’t count how many of your posts and shows have impacted me deeply. But even more-so this time...You hit this one on the head. Your wisdom and insight is such a gift to us. I only hope that more people listen and learn from you then act. — #TheResistance (@IdeaLighter) April 15 2021 I cried when I heard this. I can feel Trevor’s pain and frustration and his analogies were perfect. Thank you for your voice Trevor Noah. May we all continue to use our voice to call attention to systemic racism. — June Mullensky (@june_yasemsky) April 15 2021 Several commenters mentioned the story of good cop Cariol Horne: Cariol Horne can attest that he is right. She got fired 15 years ago for going against the system. It's a tree that throws its good apples to the ground.https://t.co/jj71BbdZ6R — Judith Lewis Mernit (@judlew) April 15 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
