C, Mick Jagger is over the coronavirus lockdowns and he has a song about it , Karen Townsend, 2021-04-13, Mick Jagger is alive and well and completely over the coronavirus pandemic and all it brings with it. In that aspect he’s like most of us. The 77-year-old Rock and Roll legend released a new single today devoted to his hot takes on the subject.  Jagger collaborated with Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl. The result is titled “Easy Sleazy” which is perfect for Jagger right? I kid. Kinda. I’m a big fan of him and the Stones who were among the groups who produced the musical touchstones of my teenage years and beyond. It’s good to see him singing. (Insert your baby boomer jokes here.) Why not a pandemic-themed song? Mick and Dave are equal opportunity bashers of all things pandemic – the boredom of lockdowns watching too much television the explosion of Tik Tok videos anti-vaxxers learning to cook gaining weight Zoom calls and the phony audience applause during sports events. It’s 2020 in a nutshell. Grohl plays drums bass and guitar while Jagger belts the lyrics out and plays guitar. If you’re a fan you can listen to the song via Mick’s tweet. I wanted to share this song that I wrote about coming out of lockdown with some much needed optimism – thank you to Dave Grohl @foofighters for jumping on drums bass and guitar it was a lot of fun working with you on this-hope you all enjoy Eazy Sleazy! https://t.co/7FoI5T36aU — Mick Jagger (@MickJagger) April 13 2021  One lyric reads: “Trying to write a tune / You better hook me up to Zoom / See my poncey books / Teach myself to cook / Way too much TV / It’s lobotomising me / Think I’ve put on on weight / I’ll have another drink / Then I’ll clean the kitchen sink.” He also complains of being “bossed around by pricks” presumably regarding the privations of lockdown but admits: “We took it on the chin / the numbers were so grim.” Tongue presumably in cheek he frets: “Shooting the vaccine / Bill Gates is in my bloodstream / It’s mind control.” Jagger brightens in the song’s second half predicting “a garden of earthly delights” in the wake of the pandemic – timed perfectly alongside the reopening of pub gardens in the UK this week – when “everything’s going to get real freaky … it’s gonna be smooth and greasy”. It is Jagger’s first solo single since 2017’s double A-side Gotta Get a Grip / England Lost. Ok. It’s not his best work but it isn’t cringeworthy either. Grohl is thrilled to have had the chance to work with Jagger. Jagger is bored and ready to have lockdowns behind him.  It’s hard to put into words what recording this song with Sir @MickJagger means to me. It’s beyond a dream come true. Just when I thought life couldn’t get any crazier……and it’s the song of the summer without a doubt!! https://t.co/hudEh7LCN2 https://t.co/irNkf9zgbq — Foo Fighters (@foofighters) April 13 2021  In April 2020 the Rolling Stones released their first original music since 2012 the single Living in a Ghost Town. It was written prior to the coronavirus crisis but seemed to pre-empt it with the lines: “Life was so beautiful / Then we all got locked down … Please let this be over / Stuck in a world without end.” Keith Richards said the band had been recording it as part of a new album with sessions disrupted by the pandemic. Grohl said recording with Jagger was “beyond a dream come true – just when I thought life couldn’t get any crazier”. Last week the Foo Fighters frontman announced his first memoir The Storyteller. Dave Grohl worked with Jagger once before in 2012 he played back up for him in a Saturday Night Live performance. The two recorded this song and video in separate studios. Jagger is going to outlive us all. Well him and Keith Richards.
