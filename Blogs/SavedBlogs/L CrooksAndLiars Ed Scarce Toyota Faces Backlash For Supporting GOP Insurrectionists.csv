L, Toyota Faces Backlash For Supporting GOP Insurrectionists, Ed Scarce, 2021-06-28, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  A report by Axios showed that Toyota is far and away the largest corporate donor to Republicans who objected to the election results.  Data compiled by the left-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington show Toyota gave $55000 to 37 GOP objectors this year. Source: Raw Story The car company Toyota is drawing criticism from those on the left for releasing a statement saying that they'll continue to support insurrectionists in Congress. Axios reported Sunday evening that Toyota handed over $55000 to 37 GOP objectors this year so far. But it was their statement that sent many fleeing from one of the early adopters to green energy. "We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification" the Toyota spokesperson told Axios in a statement. Although they did add "Based on our thorough review we decided against giving to some members who through their statements and actions undermine the legitimacy of our elections and institutions.” Though did not elaborate on what that threshold might be. Apparently Toyota cannot be shamed and feels no obligation whatsoever to be a good corporate citizen. Enjoy your Prius. Brent Terhune giving his comedic take on Toyota.  And the handy chart from Axios. Toyota is the top donor to Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 election — by far. https://t.co/EdKil41HG0 — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 28 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
