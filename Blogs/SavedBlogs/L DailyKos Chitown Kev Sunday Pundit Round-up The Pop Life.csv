L, Sunday Pundit Round-up: The Pop Life, Chitown Kev, 2021-06-27, Good morning everyone! Brian Karem of The Bulwark reports among other things that The Damn Fool is still singing the same sad songs. As it turned out it didn’t bring much that was new. Trump’s rants are now well known: They always cover Hillary Clinton the news media Hunter Biden the border etc. His ninety-minute Ohio harangue was a tired retread—a version of his failed re-election rallies that mostly made Trump sound like he belongs to the past and should stay there. Of course there were some of Trump’s favorite rally songs like the Village People’s disco tune “Macho Man” which was oddly followed by Willie Nelson’s “You Were Always on My Mind.” In reality Trump is no “Macho Man” and he only wishes he were always on our mind. The usual court jester sycophants showed up like Reps. Jim Jordan and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Also present in a cameo appearance was the MyPillow conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell. And there were the red-hatted worshipers calling for “four more years” for their adored hero. Early this month it was reported that Trump believed he would be “reinstated” to the presidency in August—as if he will merely walk up to the White House knock on the door say “I’m back!” and then be accepted as our nation’s chief executive. He did not go that far at Saturday’s rally. But he did spout a stream of grudges and grievances and gripes including an extended diatribe on his Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him... Adam Serwer writes for the New York Times on the methods of the Republican madness. After more than a decade in which Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton provided fruitful targets for an audience fearful of cultural change conservative media has struggled to turn the older white president who goes to Mass every Sunday into a compelling villain. Yet the apocalypse remains nigh threatened by the presence of those Americans they consider unworthy of the name. On Fox News hosts warn that Democrats want to “replace the current electorate” with “more obedient voters from the third world.” In outlets like National Review columnists justify disenfranchisement of liberal constituencies on the grounds that “it would be far better if the franchise were not exercised by ignorant civics-illiterate people.” Trumpist redoubts like the Claremont Institute publish hysterical jeremiads warning that “most people living in the United States today — certainly more than half — are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the term.” Under such an ideology depriving certain Americans of their fundamental rights is not wrong but praiseworthy because such people are usurpers. The Editorial Board of the Miami Herald thinks that a Miami-Dade grand jury investigation needs to begin to look into the collapse of the Champlain Towers South condominium. In addition to the immediate on-the-ground investigations this tragedy also calls for a Miami-Dade grand jury investigation. Grand juries can decide to investigate matters of great public concern and they routinely issue reports on broad topics. In Miami-Dade that has included reports on the health of Biscayne Bay in 2018 and the preparation for Hurricane Irma in 2017. A Miami-Dade grand jury in 2018 even tackled condo owners’ complaints issuing a list of recommended legislation. If ever there were an issue of public concern the collapse of Champlain Towers South qualifies. “Historically this is the sort of thing grand jurors look at” State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle who has been to the scene told the Miami Herald Editorial Board. She said that she and her team have been discussing the idea but that they are focused first and most urgently on the continuing rescue efforts. Ultimately it’s up to the jurors to decide if they will investigate though we can’t imagine a scenario in the case of Champlain in which they wouldn’t. Renée Graham of the Boston Globe on the value of Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib’s disclosure that he is gay...and Ms. Graham’s essay comes with a personal note. Much has been said about Nassib becoming the first active player in NFL history to come out. His disclosure may be even more important as Republican-led state legislatures have churned out more than 100 discriminatory bills this year. Many of them seek to ban trans girls and women from competing on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity. As an open proud member of the LGBTQ — and NFL — communities what Nassib represents matters. It also matters that the reaction to Nassib’s announcement has been mostly positive. In a statement Roger Goodell the NFL commissioner lauded Nassib for “courageously sharing his truth.” The Raiders tweeted “Proud of you Carl.” Current and former players also expressed their support. Complicating matters however Carl Nassib is a registered Republican. And yes there are discussions about that as well. Kathy Baughman McLeod of The Atlantic is spreading the news that it is hot and it will be hot; a heat wave in fact. Climate change is upending old rules and disrupting predictable weather patterns: Heat waves wildfires and tropical storms and hurricanes—the trifecta of extreme weather events—now arrive earlier than expected occur with greater frequency and intensity and stretch well past their historical timelines. But too few Americans think about heat waves which claim more lives globally than any other weather-related hazard as a problem for which systematic long-term preparation is warranted. To protect human life as temperatures soar we need to conceive of what we might call heat season as a phenomenon distinct from summer—a part of the year that people in much of the country have traditionally viewed with great fondness. Historically wildfire season in the United States has begun in May and ended in October; however wildfires raged well into December last year. The 2020 season which included 30 named storms was the most active on record. The annual Atlantic hurricane season formally begins June 1 and ends November 30. The emergence of Tropical Storm Ana on May 22 made 2021 the seventh consecutive year that a storm strong enough to be named formed off-season. Because of this early storm activity the National Weather Service has been considering moving the start of hurricane season to mid-May. Heat waves too are arriving alarmingly early. Barely a week into summer a heat dome affecting 40 million Americans lifted temperatures above 100 degrees not only in Phoenix but in places such as Denver Salt Lake City and Billings Montana. Northern locations not typically plagued by extreme heat were hit even earlier. In early June the city of Caribou in northern Maine experienced back-to-back highs of 92 degrees. Amid the heat wave nearby towns sent students home the Bangor Daily News reported and at least one restaurant closed its kitchen to prevent heat sickness. Elie Mystal writes for The Nation about the specific case of Brtiney Spears and generally about the law of conservatorship. I’ll admit that the #FreeBritney movement—the group of fans who have been reading Spears’s Instagram page and bringing attention to her conservatorship—looked more like frenzied celebrity worshipers than legal reformers to me. But I think that I was wrong. The problems experienced by Spears are not unique to her situation. Indeed Nichelle Nichols best known as Star Trek’s Lieutenant Uhura has been at the heart of a long legal battle fought by her son to wrest control of her estate from an agent who allegedly took advantage of her. Unknown numbers of seniors find their lives constricted potentially by agents or family members acting in bad faith. And what we’re learning from Spears is that oversight into these arrangements leaves a lot to be desired. At core the conservatorship system allows the state to take control of a person’s decisions once the state determines that the person is unfit to make their own choices. It’s a weird nether-region of law meant to deal with people who are well enough to be active members of society—they don’t need to be “institutionalized” as they are not a danger to themselves or others—but somehow aren’t well enough to make important life decisions like how to spend their own money. The arrangement seems a lot like the one my wife and I have with our 8-year-old: Yes he can technically feed himself but he would eat Popsicles and instant waffles until he died of scurvy if left to his own devices. The problem somewhat obviously is that Spears is not 8. She’s a grown woman who happens to have millions of dollars lying around. But conservatorship allows the state to designate a person to act a lot like her parent and tell her how she can take care of herself. Nearly all the powers I have over my kid the conservator has over Spears. In Spears’s case that conservator is literally her father Jamie Spears who Britney claims is abusive. Ivory A. Toldson of The Conversation writes about the unparalleled effects that the philanthropy of MacKenzie Scott will have on students of color. For example Scott is giving Xavier University of Louisiana a school that sends more Black graduates to medical school than any other university in the U.S. $20 million; Long Beach City College a California school where more than 85% of students are people of color $30 million; and Odessa College a Texas school where 74% of students are nonwhite $7 million. All three colleges said Scott’s donations were the largest they had ever received. As a counseling psychology professor who conducts research regarding the education of Black students I am encouraged to see Scott a novelist who was formerly married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos depart from how billionaires tend to approach their higher education giving. Most make donations to prestigious universities that already have large endowments – money raised from alumni and other donors that they invest in stocks bonds and other assets. This wealth can cover the cost of scholarships salaries construction and any other expenses. Mike Bloomberg for example donated $1.8 billion to John Hopkins University his alma mater in 2018. Notably that prestigious school receives more money from federal grants than all of the nation’s 100 HBCUs combined. Similarly I question how donations to Harvard University such as the $30 million from Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan can be considered charitable when it already has $41.9 billion in its endowment. Harvard earned a 7.3% return on its endowment assets for its fiscal year that ended in June 2020 – about $3 billion. Rene Pfister interviews American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken for Spiegel Online International. DER SPIEGEL: Secretary Blinken many German and European politicians appreciate the fact that the U.S. is returning to the world stage but there is also great concern that Donald Trump or a similar populist will take over the White House in 2025. Do you share the concern that U.S. democracy is still in a fragile condition and that Europe should therefore try to stand on its own two feet? Blinken: I think we all have to deal with the here and now and the challenges – both the problems and opportunities – that our citizens are facing together around the world. And what I have seen in just the last few months as we have been working closely with Germany with other allies and partners is that we are producing meaningful results for our own people and for people around the world. Ultimately that's what matters. If we continue to do that if we demonstrate that our democracies can deliver effectively for people then I think the approach that we're taking will be sustained. Our obligation is to actually deliver results. Finally today Mark Simon of the Washington Post on the shuttering of the Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily. It used to also be unimaginable in Hong Kong an international financial center whose success once relied on offering freedoms not granted in mainland China. But this is precisely what happened on Thursday when one of Hong Kong’s largest newspapers with more than 600000 paid subscribers to its online news platform was effectively closed down by Hong Kong authorities beholden to the Chinese Communist government in Beijing. Apple Daily didn’t just die. It was murdered. And the weapon was the controversial national security law that the China-backed authorities rammed through against considerable public opposition. The government told Apple Daily that approximately 100 opinion pieces and video interviews were part of a scheme to collude with foreign powers to damage China’s national security. I would like to point you to the offending articles so you could see for yourself if they posed any threat. But Secretary of Security John Lee won’t specify what they are. Instead authorities give the same answer they always do when someone does something Beijing doesn’t like: “You know what you did.” What Jimmy Lai and the Apple Daily team have done to upset the authorities was to advocate for democracy property rights and the rule of law. These principles are ones the Hong Kong people were promised would continue for at least 50 years under the Basic Law Hong Kong’s mini-constitution that came into effect in 1997. Everyone have a good morning!
