L, Top Comments: Eating Out Edition, cohenzeeforTop Comments, 2021-05-04, Yesterday was what would have been my late father’s 75th birthday. My mother and sister wanted to go out to eat since we hadn’t since last summer when the positivity rate here was under 1%. Unfortunately yesterday was a cold drizzly evening. This meant going to eat indoors which is something I had not done since March 11 2020. Our first choice was a local lobster farm that has added a small restaurant section a number of years ago. When we arrived the restaurant was about 50% full and there was not much spacing between tables. Plus the ceilings in the place are fairly low. I immediately nixed going there. We went outside and I tried to think of a nearby place that would be more spacious and might be less crowded. As I was thinking someone suggested we go to a new Peruvian place about a block from where we were located. We drove over and noticed no one was inside so I gave the okay to go in. During the entire time we were in the restaurant only two other couples came in to eat. Both of the them of course sat on the same wall of the restaurant we did though there was one table between each occupied table. Every other person who entered the restaurant to pick takeout wore a mask as did all the employees. I cannot say I was 100% comfortable being inside eating but I managed to make it through dinner without having a panic attack. It certainly helped the food was fantastic. I had a fish ceviche a creamy shrimp soup and a Peruvian version of creme caramel. I cannot wait to try more dishes there. Diarist reserves all rights to his original writing only.
