L, Abbreviated Pundit Roundup, eeff, 2021-04-27, Good Morning Looks like Georgia is busy this AM. Here’s an open thread "Preparation is key but failure to act can be deadly." https://t.co/4O70sA4Rv2  The cyber stealing ninjas & the AZ GOP are just as crooked as Ronna’s Election Integrity Efforts.  This is another sad attempt at pushing out misinformation & lies. Maybe we should FOIA the GOP Secretaries of State to see how many received election calls from Trump & Graham. https://t.co/HxIQCKQAVp  "As hospitals in India run out of oxygen and the country continues to set alarming records for confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths officials have ordered Twitter to take down social media posts critical of the government’s pandemic response." https://t.co/saeSHNR3aE  Instead of changing their morally bankrupt agenda that was rejected by voters in 2020 Republicans keep attacking voting rights and trying to pick their voters instead of voters picking who wins. Democrats are pushing back on their attacks to safeguard democracy #ForThePeople. Hope your Tuesday is a good one
