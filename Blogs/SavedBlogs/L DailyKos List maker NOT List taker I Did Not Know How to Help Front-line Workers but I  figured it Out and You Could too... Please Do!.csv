L, I Did Not Know How to Help Front-line Workers but I  figured it Out and You Could too... Please Do!, List maker NOT List taker, 2021-04-30, I always appreciated and thank the helpers… but the added pressures and deaths are taking a huge toll on the healthcare workers own heath and well-being especially the mental exhaustion.  Thanking them is really not enough.  I am a giver and now a senior so I have been feeling really down and unable to do the volunteering I usually still try to do.  I donated to soup kitchens and relief funds but I finally found a way to help frontline people and I have been lighter and so much happier to be able to do something … I have 6 front line people on my street teachers (My direct neighbour works with special needs so she is especially busy) and a cop and 2 in healthcare… so I make meals for their whole families.  I made sure none have allergies.  I call and tell them I made dinner (I also tell them what I made or will make to be sure they will enjoy it) and make sure they’ll be home and have it hot and ready on their doorstep when they come home.  The healthcare folks get it more often.  They deserve it. Making a larger batch of stew/lasagna/ribs/chili is not much more difficult and it brings tears of joy for exhausted workers who also need to care for themselves and their families after an already exhausting day.  I make 5 lasagnas at a time and believe me making one or 5 is not that much different.   MY HUGE HINT:   I  make the sauce and meat filing on one day and add them together in pails.   Then I can make the lasagnas or freeze them until I am good and ready for all that layering.    I also make muffins cookies and bread in large batches to share.  My homemade lemonade with added vodka  (labeled of course) is a big hit too…  for those I know will appreciate it.  So please find a way to use the talents you have to thank those people you know at the front lines by alleviating their pressures and exhaustion in any way you can think of…   (and even those you don’t know too)   It is truly rewarding.  They aren’t the only ones with a tear in their eyes…     Because I know we can’t all cook or bake … here are some more ideas other than staying home when you can wearing masks and keeping a distance when you are out:  Offer to shop for them when you shop… or give them a gift card.  Order them takeout.   Mow their  lawn.  Better yet if you know them well enough ask what you can do to help and leave your phone number too so they know you mean it.     See if your city or town has something called sustain the line… and if not make a team of friends who can start one to help small businesses and feed healthcare workers.   8 ways to thank essential workers HERE How to support frontline workers during COVID-19 HERE The Parachute mental health-line link is not working at the last URL.  Please direct anyone you know who needs help or if you are a licensed mental health practitioner who wishes to help contact:  EmotionalPPE.org The Emotional PPE Project is a directory that provides contact information of volunteer mental health practitioners to healthcare workers whose mental health has been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.
