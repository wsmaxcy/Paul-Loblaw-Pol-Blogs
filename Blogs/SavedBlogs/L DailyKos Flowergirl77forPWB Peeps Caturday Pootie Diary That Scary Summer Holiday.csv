L, Caturday Pootie Diary: That Scary Summer Holiday, Flowergirl77forPWB Peeps, 2021-07-03, “Come here little guy” I said scooping him up and carrying him to the couch. “We have to talk about this weekend.” He gave a few half-hearted bicycle kicks and settled down in my arms resigned. “Good boy” I murmured sitting down and positioning him on my lap. “So. This weekend.” “Are you leaving again?” he asked suspicious. “Nope! That was a once a year or so thing. We’ll probably stay home all weekend. And it’s a long weekend! So we’ll only go to work four days next week!” “That’s...good” he said tentative. “It’s um Independence Day” I explained. “So?” You know how this works but as always a gentle reminder:  Pooties are cats; Woozles are dogs.  Goggies are dogs too and moggies are cats. Birds...are birds!  Peeps are people.  PWB Peeps are Pooties Woozle Birds People.  No trolling the diary. "It’s really not a big deal” I said. “You’re making me nervous” he told me. “Nothing to be nervous about. It’s summer. You know about summer right?” “It gets hot” he said slowly. “Yes!” “And the lizards come out.” “They do!” “And it’s very hot!” “That’s right! It’s very hot and there’s fireworks!”   I was actually sweating a little with him on my lap but I powered through. “It officially became summer last week” I said stalling a little. “Okaaaaaay” he said dragging the word out. “And right at the beginning of official summer there’s a holiday.” “Independence Day’ he repeated to me. “Right. I told you that.” “You’re stalling” he accused. “What’s so terrible about this holiday?” “Nothing!” I said quickly. “It’s just hot and there might be some fireworks.”   “What?” “Yep!” I said quickly. “Super hot! So we will probably go swimming. Maybe even on the holiday! It’s a good holiday for swimming.” “Are people coming over to go swimming?” he asked eyes narrowing. “Not this year” I said. “Maybe next year.” “So what’s the big deal? I see you go swimming. I think it’s ridiculous but you don’t ask me first.” “There’s no big deal” I reassured him. “Just warm weather and swimming. And fireworks.”   “Did you say —?” “And barbecue! Did I mention the barbecue?!” “No” Freddie said. “I’d remember that.” “Lots of good barbecue cooked on the grill outside.” He turned his head and looked out the window. “We don’t have a grill” I explained. “But our neighbors probably do. You’ll smell lots of good barbecue.” “Just smell?” he asked disappointed. “Maybe we’ll get some!” I said quickly. “We can eat during the fireworks!”    “During the what?” “Yummy yummy barbecue. Meats and veggies and more meats!” “You keep saying — “ “That it’s hot during the summer? Because it is!” “Yes...” he said slowly. “Nothing to worry about but a little heat. But we’ll keep the fan on and make sure you have plenty of water. And you’ll be safe inside when the jerk neighbors start with their barbecue and fireworks.”   “Okay. I think you keep saying ‘fireworks’ but you do it so quickly — “ “I bet there will be music and laughter all over” I said. “That might get a little loud. Plus the fireworks.” We stared at each other. “There’s fireworks?” he asked. I cleared my throat uncomfortable. “Yeah” I said finally. His ears went flat to his head. “It’s okay” I said gently petting him. “You’ll be inside and safe. Noise can't hurt you. And I’ll be here with you.”   “I don’t like fireworks” he said softly. “I know” I said. “It’ll be okay.” “You know what will make it better?” he asked eyes wide and voice sad. “Tell me.” “Some barbecue.” I sighed. “I can arrange that.” Happy Caturday Peeps! Freddie does okay with fireworks — we are fortunate to live in an area where they are illegal. That doesn’t mean the jerks who live behind us don’t buy some in the next city and shoot them off all night but it does mean that they are the only ones. We aren’t surrounded. I hope your pooties and woozles and birbs do okay this weekend. Freddie and I will be thinking of them.
