L, New Day Cafe: Is It Cheugy?, samanthabforNew Day Cafe, 2021-05-03,  The New York Times recently introduced me to the term “cheugy” a word popularized on TikTok by 24 year old copywriter Hallie Cain. She began using the term seven years ago as a student at Beverly Hills High School.  That should give you and idea of the amount of privilege involved in fussing over these nuances of cool vs. uncool.  There’s a certain trying-too-hard aesthetic that isn’t quite “basic” or “uncool” — but what is it?A term gaining popularity on TikTok may fit the bill: “The word my friend is ‘cheugy.’” https://t.co/0Y9jIrUssM  As the New York Times explains the word is:  “It’s not quite ‘basic’ which can describe someone who is a conformist or perhaps generic in their tastes and it’s not quite ‘uncool.’ It’s not embarrassing or even always negative. Cheugy (pronounced chew-gee) can be used broadly to describe someone who is out of date or trying too hard. And while a lot of cheugy things are associated with millennial women the term can be applied to anyone of any gender and any age.  It’s not just a way to describe people. According to people who have embraced the word the following are also cheugy: The Hype House  Golden Goose sneakers anything associated with Barstool Sports  Gucci belts with the large double “G” logo being really into sneaker culture Rae Dunn pottery and anything chevron.  ‘One of my friends said lasagna is cheugy’ said Ms. Cain.   Things that are decidedly un-cheugy according to its progenitors: thrifting making your own clothes handmade products Levi’s jeans Birkenstocks home decor not found at Target. ‘Looking good for yourself and not caring what other people think that confidence exudes non-cheugyness’ said Gaby Rasson 23 a software developer in Los Angeles who coined the term.”   Some things determined to be cheugy by the Instagram account Cheuglife:  -Pinterest.
