C, Lachlan Murdoch takes a hard pass on ADL's demand that Tucker Carlson get the axe , Karen Townsend, 2021-04-13, The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) issued a demand that Fox News Channel silence top-rated show host Tucker Carlson over Carlson’s remarks during a recent interview. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt accuses Carlson of making veiled references to the “Great Replacement” theory as Carlson spoke about changing demographics and how that changes voting patterns. Greenblatt turned to CNN’s Brian Stelter with his complaint about Carlson’s rhetoric and the ADL’s letter to Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott. Greenblatt has not appeared on Carlson’s show to discuss the matter.  Carlson was a guest on another FNC show. During the interview the ADL CEO interpreted Carlson’s remarks about Democrats being in favor of open borders and universal amnesty in order to bring in future Democrat voters. This is a common complaint from border security hawks. When Democrats don’t like common sense conclusions being made against domestic policies they claim to hear dog whistles. During the interview Carlson specifically made a point to say that he was not addressing a racial issue but a voting rights issue.  A reporter with Media Matters (the anti-FNC watchdog) tweeted out the ‘controversial’ comments made by Tucker.

Oh white replacement. No. This is a voting rights question. I have less political power because they’re importing a brand new electorate. Why should I sit back and take that?” Lachlan Murdoch Fox Corp.’s executive chairman and CEO is not caving to the ADL. Tucker Carlson has the highest-rated cable television show on the air. His show consistently ranks number one in ratings. Why would Murdoch cave to the perpetually outraged mob when Carlson’s remarks are easily interpreted in a benign not hostile light? Carlson was not referencing legal immigration but illegal immigration as a negative role in changing demographics. The far-left consistently conflates the distinction between legal and illegal immigration.  “A full review of the guest interview indicates that Mr. Carlson decried and rejected replacement theory” Murdoch wrote in a letter to the ADL according to a posting on the ADL website. “As Mr. Carlson himself stated during the guest interview ‘White replacement theory? No no this is a voting rights question’” Murdoch added.  Carlson addressed the controversy in his opening remarks on Monday night’s show. He pointed out the hypocrisy of the ADL’s position by referencing its position on the Palestinian “right to return” to Israel which the ADL is against. Why? Because it changes the national identity of Israel.  He cited the ADL’s position on not giving Palestinians the “right of return” to Israel to defend his own position opposing mass immigration into America citing their own website: “It is unrealistic and unacceptable to expect the State of Israel to voluntarily subvert its own sovereign existence and nationalist identity and become a vulnerable minority within what was once its own territory.” “Now from Israel’s perspective this makes perfect sense why would any democratic nation make its own citizens less powerful? Isn’t that the deepest betrayal of all?” Carslon asked before inviting ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt to come on the program to discuss it. A country’s sovereignty is crucial in order to remain a country. This is just common sense. Open borders change a country regardless of skin color or nationality of illegal immigrants at the expense of legal residents. It is not a dog whistle to point out some basic observations.  If you missed Carlson’s show on Monday you can watch the opening monologue for yourself. It’s longer than most but clearly he is addressing an important subject and pushing back on being labeled a white supremacist. Shutting down open free-flowing discussions doesn’t solve anything.
