L, From the GNR Newsroom: The Monday Good News Roundup, JessiestafforGood News, 2021-05-03, Merry May everyone! I don’t have much else to say so lets get right to it: Welcome to the Monday Good News Roundup where we bring in five fabulous good news stories to make you happy to be alive and happy that Trump is no longer president. So lets get right into it. Special thanks as always to the GNR Newsroom team of Bhu and Killer300 for some of this weeks stories.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump kept up his attack on U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday saying Republicans would do well to find a new leader if they hope to take back the Senate in 2022.  Trump launched the latest salvo on Fox Business Network when his interviewer asked about the upcoming mid-term election battle for control of the Senate and House of Representatives.  "We need good leadership. Mitch McConnell has not done a great job. I think they should change Mitch McConnell" the former president said.  Asked about Trump's comments McConnell told Fox News Channel: "We're looking to the future not the past." Its always painful and awkward to watch a well beloved duo breaking up. This however is great. Its evil and stupid vs. Stupid and evil. And whoever wins we also win.  Oh yeah this idiot. It always fun when assholes get their comeuppance especially when they act like it was never coming.  SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Republicans booed Sen. Mitt Romney but ultimately rejected a motion to censure him Saturday for his votes at President Donald Trump’s impeachment trials. The measure narrowly failed 798 to 711 in a vote by delegates to the state GOP convention The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Romney drew heavy boos when he came to the podium earlier in the day. Davis County delegate Don Guymon who authored the resolution said Romney’s votes to remove Trump from office “hurt the Constitution and hurt the party.” Romney may be the smartest Republican politician in Washington or at the very least the one with the most developed sense of self preservation since he’s the only one not hitching his wagon to the Trump train as it plunges off a cliff.  Unilever has partnered with LanzaTech and India Glycols to produce a laundry soap made from industrial carbon emissions—instead of from fossil-fuels. The innovative shift in production utilizes biotechnologies and a newly configured supply chain between the three partners who are working together for the first time. Typically derived from fossil fuels surfactants are a critical ingredient for creating the foam and cleaning action of many household cleaning and laundry products—from dish soaps to fabric detergents. The new process now allows surfactants to be made using recycled carbon. Recycled carbon is a key form of renewable carbon and is essential to eliminating the use of fossil fuels. Every day we find more and more ways to deal with the problem of carbon emissions and we find ways to make fossil fuels more and more irrelevant. Carbon emissions: Boil em mash em stew em in a pot. Or in this case use them to clean your clothes.  Australia last week committed $100 million to ocean conservation in an effort to protect ‘blue carbon’ environments and reduce emissions. Uniquely suited to care about marine life as the world’s only island continent the investment package will also support Australian Marine Parks expand the Indigenous Protected Areas in the Sea Country and protection of marine species. Much of the funding will go towards ecosystems that involve seagrass and mangroves which play a key role in drawing carbon out of the atmosphere. Nice to see Australia is bouncing back after spending much of the last year on fire hopefully this will help that from happening again. One can hope.  And hope is what we’re all about at the good news roundup isn’t it? Hope for a brighter future hope we can fix the mess that we find ourselves in hope that we wont make the same mistakes again. And I for one hope you all have a good Monday. See you next week. Stop the presses we have one more bonus story compliments of Killer300. Thanks buddy! We estimate that 50% of young people ages 18-29 voted in the 2020 presidential election a remarkable 11-point increase from 2016 (39%) and likely one of the highest rates of youth electoral participation since the voting age was lowered to 18. Our new estimate is based on newly available voter file data in 41 states—AK DC HI MD MS NH ND UT WI WY do not have reliable vote history data by age. This analysis replaces our earlier estimate released immediately after Election Day which estimated a 5 to 11 point increase in youth voter turnout compared to 2016 based on data available in that moment. So that’s very good news for us. Its always good to see young people becoming engaged with voting.
