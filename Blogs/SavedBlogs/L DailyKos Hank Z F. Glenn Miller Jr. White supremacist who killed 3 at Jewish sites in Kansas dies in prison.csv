L, F. Glenn Miller Jr. White supremacist who killed 3 at Jewish sites in Kansas dies in prison, Hank Z, 2021-05-04, I won’t be shedding any tears for him!  A white supremacist who killed three people at Jewish sites in Overland Park Kansas in 2014 has died in prison according to the Kansas Department of Corrections. F. Glenn Miller Jr. convicted of capital murder in 2015 died Monday at the El Dorado Correctional Facility. Miller’s cause of death is pending an autopsy but a preliminary assessment indicates he died of natural causes prison officials said. He was 80. Miller’s April 13 2014 rampage outside the Jewish Community Center and the Village Shalom care center took the lives of Reat Underwood 14; his grandfather William Corporon 69; and 53-year-old Terri LaManno who worked with visually impaired children. Jurors found the murders especially heinous and sentenced Miller to death. Miller who lived in Aurora in southwest Missouri was also sentenced to more than 32 years in prison for other crimes which included attempted murder for shooting at people who were not struck by his gunfire. Miller told jurors during the trial he regretted not killing more people. “On most days” he said at the time “it’s the first thing I think about in the morning and the last thing I think about at night.” The shooting spree on April 13 2014 at the Jewish Community Center and Village Shalom care center was fueled by Miller’s virulent hatred of Jewish people and his belief in a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the “white race.” Full story at this.kiji.is/...
