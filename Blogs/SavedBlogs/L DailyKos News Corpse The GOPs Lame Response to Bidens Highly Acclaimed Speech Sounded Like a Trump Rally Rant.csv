L, The GOP's Lame Response to Biden's Highly Acclaimed Speech Sounded Like a Trump Rally Rant, News Corpse, 2021-04-29, President Biden's long anticipated address to Congress was delivered Wednesday night with the grace compassion and appeal for unity that has become the hallmark of Joe Biden's presidency Biden spoke to the full array of issues that have been at the top of the American people's list of priorities including the coronavirus pandemic economic recovery jobs climate change healthcare infrastructure race police reform education tax equity gun safety immigration and foreign policy. It was a speech that radiated the calm resolve of a confidant and competent leader as opposed to the fire-breathing bluster and lie-riddled babbling of the Former Guy Donald Trump. Apparently the American people are relieved to finally have a sane president after four years of lunacy incompetence rancor and chaos. They appreciated hearing a speech that wasn't crammed with flagrant falsehoods vicious insults and the pathological undeserved bragging of malignant narcissist. A CBS News poll found that Biden's speech was received with overwhelming favorability. The poll showed that a huge majority of those who watched the speech approved of it (85%). They thought Biden was "presidential" (89%) "caring" (89%) "inspiring" (84%) and "bold" (80%). They said the speech made them feel "optimistic" (78%) and that his plans would "mostly help" them (74%). However it didn't take long to be reminded of the GOP's way outside Trumpian view as Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina stepped up to deliver the Republican response (video below). He began by throwing some passive-aggressive shade saying that "We just heard President Biden's first address to Congress. Our President seems like a good man. His speech was full of good words." "Seems like" a good man? That's the sort of backhanded "compliment" someone might say about Ted Bundy. Scott went on to disparage Biden's promise to "unite a nation" "lower the temperature" and to "govern for all Americans." "But three months in" Scott complained without any basis "the actions of the President and his party are pulling us further apart." Scott also vowed that he wouldn't "waste your time tonight with finger-pointing or partisan bickering." What came next was fourteen minutes of finger-pointing and bitterly partisan rhetoric. For instance:        However perhaps the most disturbing part of Scott's harangue was when he raised the matter of race. As the only Black Republican in the Senate he has some license to speak on the subject. Sadly he wasted it. He forcefully beseeched the nation to "Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country." But that came just two minutes after relating this real-world experience of most Black Americans:   So which is it? it's hardly possible to undergo those indignities and prejudices in a country that isn't racist to some notable degree. And add to that the way too frequent incidents of police shootings of Black people; the recent Capitol insurrection that featured Confederate flags and rioters shouting epithets at Black officers; the growth of white nationalist groups and militias. At least Biden actually referenced that brand of domestic terrorism in his speech saying that... The speech by Scott could have been written by Donald Trump or more likely one of his speech writers since Trump is borderline illiterate. It was hostile dishonest and littered with right-wing rhetoric and invective. There wasn't a hint of any policy proposals because Republicans don't have any actual ideas other than hating on Democrats. That was the resounding message contained in the GOP response. And the American people saw it and will have their own response when election time comes again. NOTE: Twitter recently suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
