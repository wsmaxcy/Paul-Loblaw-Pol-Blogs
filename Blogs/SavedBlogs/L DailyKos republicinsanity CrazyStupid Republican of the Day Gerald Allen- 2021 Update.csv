L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Gerald Allen- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-05-03, On this date in 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” published profiles of Alabama State Senator Gerald Allen who over the past two decades who repeatedly made revolting anti-gay and anti-Islamic statements as well as called for fanatical censorship laws to be put in place. As early as 2004 Allen was boasting about meeting President Bush (43) and calling for any book with “positive images of homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle” to be banned including the works of Truman Capote Gore Vidal Tennessee Williams and Alice Walker claiming that their existence was an “attack on family values” that he compared to Al-Qaeda. When Allen could not get his book ban to pass he predictably painted himself as a victim of religious persecution. Fast forward to 2011 and Allen was trying to pass Sharia Law bans in Alabama but when asked what Sharia Law actually was.As a legislator Gerald Allen has voted to nullify federal firearms laws shut down all of Alabama’s abortion clinics via trap laws sponsored fetal heartbeat bills voted to drug test welfare recipients (always a failed conservative experiment) and voted to prevent the expansion of Medicaid in his home state. For whatever reason (HINT: he’s really racist) back over the summer of 2015 after the mass shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston South Carolina occurred when Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley followed the lead of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and removed a Confederate flag from a monument that stood at the north side of Alabama’s own state capitol Gerald Allen responded to sponsor SB 13 to make it HARDER to remove Confederate iconography from around the state. He then defended his legislation as you’d expect from a man who likes to portray himself the victim when confronted about being any kind of a bigot saying “There is a revisionist movement afoot to cover over many parts of American history. Our national and state history should be remembered as it happened. The politically-correct movement to strike whole periods of the past from our collective memory is divisive and unnecessary.”Gerald Allen made it a point in 2017 to make sure the landmarks of the Confederacy would not be taken down and to continue to honor a failed rebellion fought against the federal government over the desire to continue to own other human beings sponsoring legislation to keep those monuments to it in place. Y’know important issues that were in no way resolved really 150 years ago. In fact just prior to that bill passing around the end of May 2017 Allen commented on the bill saying that he hoped it would end “the wave of political correctness” that he feels so victimized by. With public opinion starting to turn in favor of gun control in the wake of several mass shootings including the one in Parkland Florida Gerald Allen has also been paying lip service to doing something about ‘mental health” to prevent gun violence.Gerald Allen coasted to re-election in 2018 and has gone back to work in the Alabama state legislature filing disturbingly conservative legislation like sponsoring a bill that would eliminate the requirement that you need to apply for a permit for concealed carry of handguns and instead just letting everyone do it if they want. We have no idea when he’ll get around to doing anything about that “mental health” problem he claims is causing an increase in gun violence though. In 2020 one of the most stressful times in American history you can bet a legislator like Gerald Allen is doing all that he can to help our country like passing a law to force public school children to all stand for the Star Spangled Banner once a week. At least they would have had all public schools not been closed because of COVID-19. He’s not backed off his forced nationalism in schools sponsoring another bill so that the national anthem be played in Alabama schools during the 2021 session.Most recently Gerald Allen has turned some heads for trying to pass legislation to rename Cousette Drive in his district to Saban Boulevard. after the Alabama football coach. While that might not normally be controversial Cousette Drive was just renamed LAST YEAR after a fallen African American police officer and suddenly Allen wants to switch this specific street out of all the ones in town to the coach instead. Interesting…If nothing else George Allen remains consistent at being a failure.
