L, Do Not Remain Silent, fpetranech, 2021-05-03, The Epoch Times STE 324 3231 S. Halsted Street Chicago IL 60608 May 1 2021 Received your solicitation for a subscription to your paper.  Permit me to address the front page headline in one of the enclosed Sample Editions of The Epoch Times from April 21-27 2021. The headline asks: Why The Epoch Times? - - - And answers the question in par. 2 of the statement: “The mission of The Epoch Times is to chase the truth to ground all statements in fact and to prevent people from being misled.”   The solicitation enclosed a separate subscription form with a heading that reads: THE EPOCH TIMES - TRUTH and TRADITION.  Turn the form over and we see five endorsements Sean Hannitty Sebastian Gorka Paul Gosar Larry Elder and Carrie Sheffield.  Every one of these people have built their careers on anything but TRUTH.   Let’s start with US Rep Gosar (R-AZ).  Six of his siblings appeared in campaign ads before his election urging his defeat.  The words they used to describe him are “racist” “corrupt” “ignorant” and “hateful.”  His brother Dave said “He is in my opinion about as despicable a politician as I have ever seen.”  That’s six count them six of his siblings!  I think it’s kind of a foregone conclusion that Rep Gosar’s family doesn’t think he lives up to The Epoch Times’ mission why should your readers trust you if you’re proud of his endorsement?   Larry Elder and Carrie Sheffield are two minor right-wing conservative actors of little note so we’re left with Hannity and Gorka.  Both epitomes of EPOCH liars.  Enough said about that paragraph 2’s mission concerning “truth facts” and not misleading people.  I rest my case.   Now we turn to the second Apr 21-27 Sample Edition enclosed with your solicitation for a subscription: The front page headline is an article by John Mills titled The United States of 2 Americas.   We need go no further than another paragraph 2 to reveal your hypocrisy: “The president and the vice president are who they are now because six Republican-controlled states forwarded questionable electoral votes and Vice President Mike Pence missed a historic opportunity to challenge those votes.  The current president and vice president seem trapped in foggy and abstract ideological slogans rather than providing executive leadership.   Vague generalities and virtue signaling aren’t replacements for executive leadership.” I don’t even know what “virtue signaling” is but is the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan a good enough example of “vague generalities” and a good enough example of “replacements for executive leadership?”   Now let’s back up to “Questionable electoral votes.”  Really?  Of the 64 lawsuits filed by trump and his flunkies to overturn the 2020 election not one court (the nation’s arbiters of truth and facts in case you didn’t know it) ruled in favor of the loser and his sycophants.  Including the US Sup. Ct!  If the Epoch Times disputes this please cite which one of those 60 odd lawsuits supports the outright misleading statements that John Mills mentioned.  Contrary to what he intimated the Jan 6th insurrection was in fact an attempt to overturn the lawful election of president-elect Joe Biden.  A.K.A. sedition.  It’s why trump was impeached for the second time!  Couldn’t you at least have mentioned that fact?   It seems to me that one has to ask if John Mills and by extension The Epoch Times supports the insurrection.  I’ll grant you that you people probably weren’t part of the mob that was looking for Mike Pence so they could hang him but there is no proof of that now is there?  No now the tone is simply “Vice President Mike Pence missed a historic opportunity to challenge those votes.”   What happened to the fact that there was an insurrection that was in fact incited by trump?  Truth and facts and preventing people from being misled you say.  Yeah right.  I don’t have to rest my case that The Epoch Times and John Mills are not fulfilling their mission to “chase the truth to ground all statements in fact and to prevent people from being misled.”  It is self-evident that The Epoch Times makes my case for me.  End of my letter to The Epoch Times.  Of course my letter will get tossed.  Of course there is no power on Earth that is capable of persuading any of these right-wing goofballs of how wrong they are.  But we cannot stay silent against the onslaught of demagoguery such as what we’re witnessing in these publications by The Epoch Times et al.  Our silence is what emboldened their previously marginalized fence-sitters (turned wackos)  into what has become mainstream terrorists.  So they will surely discard my letter to them but they can’t get rid of the public release of this letter to inform reasonable people of what they’re saying what they’re doing and how they’re doing it.  And - - - damn it felt good to tell ‘em off.
