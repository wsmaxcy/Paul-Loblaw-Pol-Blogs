L, Deb Haaland Confirmed As First Native American Cabinet Secretary, Susie Madrak, 2021-03-16, When Deb Haaland was first nominated by Joe Biden to head the Department of the Interior a friend who lives in New Mexico and works with Native tribes told me how conflicted he was: "I hate to lose her as our representative because she's so good. But our loss is the country's gain." And another friend a Native attorney said it was hard to express how happy it made her. "Representation matters." What a long strange trip it's been as someone once said. I just keep thinking of how many ways we screwed the Indians and this is a big step toward fixing that. Secretary Haaland an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo will be an advocate for people and the earth not the oil lobby: My friend @DebHaalandNM believes in preserving our public lands for generations to come. And she can help the federal government honor its promises to tribal nations. She‚Äôs going to be an incredible @Interior Secretary. #DebForInterior pic.twitter.com/eSWGsCNM01 ‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 15 2021 Thrilled to see @debhaalandnm make history.
