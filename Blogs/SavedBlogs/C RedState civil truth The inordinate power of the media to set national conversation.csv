C, The inordinate power of the media to set national conversation, civil truth, 2020-11-18, One of the few bright spots in the cultural conflict underway has been the rise of alternative media including sites such as RedState that provide some venue for conservative view that the established media will not allow fair hearing for. And clearly they have found readership and have impacted some political races and policy decisions. However this election season unfortunately demonstrates the continuing power of the mainstream media acting in lockstep with each other and in collusion with the social media companies to dominate and drive public perception of the controversies surrounding the election processes and outcome. In particular we first saw utter suppression of the Hunter Biden scandals first through failure to report and then compounded with outright censorship which kept vital information hidden from many in the public some of whom in surveys report they would have voted differently had they known. And now with the initial reports of a Biden victory we saw a nearly immediate decision on the media to declare Biden a winner and to ban questions and any suggestion of fraud or irregularities as beyond the pale of discourse again leading to social media censorship and now deplatforming of dissenters and questioners – including demands even that Trump act to accept a Biden victory even as he is exercising his legal rights to investigate and challenge the reported election results. But as a result we see that the media drive to create a narrative of fait accompli has dominated conversation at least among many citizens in my conservative locale who are resigned to a Biden win and expecting challenges to fail. And on the international front we have have many international leaders buying this narrative as well and congratulating and even conversing with Biden (or his campaign/”transition” team).  * * * * * * * * But to further illustrate the media’s power just image if the party roles were reversed an apparent Republican challenger unexpectedly defeating the Democrat incumbent President amidst charges of fraud etc. How would the media be covering this story? Well first we’d see many demonstrations (and “mostly peaceful” riots) break out which the media would report as outraged citizens protesting. We’d have frequent interviews of Democrat leaders and “citizens in the streets” complaining of fraud and having their votes negated by Republican fraud with the approbation of the media interviewers. Interspersed we’d have multiple interviews of statisticians and professors of statistics describing their findings of voting patterns and numbers that they would explain were statistically highly improbable to impossible. We’d have other “experts” explaining all the deviations from accepted election practices including the stopping of counts and driving out observers interference with observations and many reports of clearly illegal activities. We’d have almost unceasing commentators and news anchors echoing and reinforcing these claims. We’d have reporters constantly badgering election officials about the election irregularities and asking why they were refusing audits and recounts. We’d have constantly badgering of Republican elected officials and Party officers as to whether the support and defend these irregularities. And international leaders would refrain from congratulations to the Republican candidate. And we can imagine the social media tsunami of protest and invective against all Republicans who would defend the election outcome soon joined in with an outright declaration by the companies that they were declaring the election fraudulent and they were flagging or even banning statements of support and people who were supporting the election outcome. We’d be hearing this over and over almost 24 hours a day pushing the Republicans into an increasingly uphill battle to prove the validity of the election as they move more and more weaklings into accepting and promoting the Democrat claims. And as a result we’d have established in the public square a narrative of an election with suspect results due to likely fraud and that the outcome would remain in doubt until the necessary investigations were done and votes recounted to prove what “everybody knows to be the case”: that the claims of a Republican Presidential victory were illegitimate – and would persist in intensifying the pressures until the election results were annulled and the Democrat “rightfully” be declared the winner of a second term of the Presidential race along with preservation of a Democratic Senate and the flipping of the House to Democratic control. These contrasting situations – this is the power of the media.
