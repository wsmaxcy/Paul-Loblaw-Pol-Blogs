L, In Pastor Johnny Enlow's Vision "Still President" DJT Is Seated on a Throne Holding a Golden Scepter, TheCriticalMind, 2021-05-08, There is no end to the Republican post-electoral lunacy — and it won’t end soon. There is too much money and power on the line. And the religious right has to explain that God is in fact right — if a little delayed. Pastor Johnny Enlow is typical of the conservative evangelical approach to the ‘he’s still President fantasy’ of religious fundamentalists. And to underline the divine nature of his revealed truth Johnny couches his ‘proofs’ in the vernacular of the faithful. Specifically in an April 30th Facebook post he claims: “As I was praying today I saw a vision of DJT seated on a throne holding a golden scepter. He also had a golden crown on his head.” He takes this vision of a modern politician posed in a biblical mise-en-scene as symbolic of the celestial powers announcing Trump is still President. That’s not all. His revelation is just one piece of his point. The post as a whole outlines his case that the Left stole the Presidency. He starts by explaining that the prophets were right from the get-go. OK let’s play along. If prophecy was fulfilled why is Biden sitting in the Oval Office running the country? Easy. The Democrats cheated. “The ensuing unparalleled in history steal that saw multiple states claim thousands more votes than registered voters (pause and let that register) is not going to stand.” There are two problems with Enlow’s explanation. One it is not true — and has repeatedly been debunked. Two the contested states that Trump lost — PA GA NH WI MI AZ — have Republicans in control of the State Legislature. In many they also have the Governorship & Secretary of State. Why did these right-winger state officials allow so obvious a fraud? Speaking of Arizona there the Republican-controlled Senate has thrown a Hail Mary pass — demanding an independent audit of the Maricopa County results. When the state has already done audits and recounts. This gives Enlow hope: I’ll take his word for it that the Democrats have sent 100 lawyers — that’s the nature of modern politics. But I suspect that the Republicans have as many or more lawyers on the ground. And talking of the law the observant reader will notice that Enlow has not yet referred to the 86 lawsuits filed and lost by Trump the Republicans and their ragged army of Four Season lawyers contesting the election.  He will have to explain how this judicial shut-out occurred after four years of the Republicans packing the courts with candidates vetted for ideology rather than their ability. And that while Trump was still President and the Justice Department was still under his control. While we’re waiting let’s see what else Enlow has to offer. “Mr.Pillow man has 100% percent [sic] proof of the national election steal—  though the results will have to be searched for because the thieves have cohorts in big tech platforms trying to suppress the truth. It is yet another proof the prophets who prophesied DJT would win— were not wrong.”    It’s reasonable to assume he’s referring to Mike Lindell the ‘My Pillow’ guy. I‘m not sure how a bedding salesman comes by this absolute proof which has failed to materialize for anyone else — but no never mind. Let’s instead analyze his claim that the ‘results’ are being suppressed. Even if Facebook (and let’s note he’s making this charge on Facebook) Twitter Instagram and the others are conspiring to bury the truth there’s still ‘Telegraph’ and Lindell’s own social media site ‘Frank’. Granted they are pretty amateurish and haven’t really caught on.   Even so there’s still Fox News OANN and Newsmax — not to mention eager Republican politicians totally invested in the ‘Big Lie’ that the election was stolen. Why aren’t they broadcasting this “100% percent proof of the national election steal”? The answer is obvious and has a lot to do with defamation lawsuits.  Let’s get back to Enlow. He is also unhappy with his co-religionists who have put evidence over wishful thinking and declared Biden the legitimate President. You can take my word for his feelings. Or you can read what he wrote (warning it’s convoluted): Meanwhile there is a leadership group in the Body of Christ upping the ante at going after the prophets that don’t back down on what God said— and is still saying. They consider that if a thief has managed to hold the loot from a robbery for 5 or 6 months that it now has be considered fair and square his loot. They see it as a valuable service to the Body of Christ to “rein in” these prophets who keep agreeing with God. They have unwisely partnered with the thief while true prophetic voices have no choice but to agree with God. If God changes His mind we will too. If He doesn’t we won’t either. I’m guessing He won’t change His mind. This is where Enlow gets to his vision of “DJT seated on a throne holding a golden scepter”. He then fleshed out his thought by claiming Biden (JB) lacks the celestial trappings of authority. Although what that has to do with anything is unclear. The constitutional provisions for presidential elections may be arcane but even they give no weight to thrones and scepters This I was shown is his PRESENT status from heaven’s perspective. That becomes all I need to know as to should I back off saying “the steal will not hold”. Heaven does not recognize JB having any scepter nor wearing any crown. From heaven’s perspective there is only the legitimacy of DJT. God has assigned a massive contingency of angels to that scepter and to that crown. They have not ceased assignment and anointed seers can see this. Enlow has one lengthy final paragraph but I think we have all suffered enough. So I will spare you any analysis. Let it be said that as bad the beginning and middle were the ending is worse. But if you must see it you can find it by clicking on the Johnny + Elizabeth Enlow FB page and scrolling back to April 30th. Good luck.
