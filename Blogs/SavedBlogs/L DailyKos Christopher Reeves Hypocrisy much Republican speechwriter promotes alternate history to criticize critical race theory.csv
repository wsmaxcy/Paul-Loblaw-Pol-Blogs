L, Hypocrisy much? Republican speechwriter promotes alternate history to criticize critical race theory, Christopher Reeves, 2021-06-27, Remember this guy in the photo? In the stream of the QAnon-loving Republicans today you’d think they had just forgotten him. He denounced Trump (far too late) and got on board with vaccines (too soon for the QAnon conspirators). If you want to know a lot about where the Republican Party is right now take a look at the people who go to work in the Republican infrastructure. They know what the base wants and they will say whatever it takes to continue to be relevant. Enter Ned Ryun—former Bush speechwriter son of Kansas congressman Jim Ryun who was defeated by Democratic candidate Nancy Boyda in a bit of an upset. Ned is now a ridiculous puppet for outright bonkers ideas. I guarantee you 100% if Martin Luther King Jr were alive today he would be horrified by CRT and BLM and if/when he spoke out against it MSNBC and CNN would call him an Uncle Tom. Too bad he isn’t here to answer that right Ned? Care to answer how that came about? The response to Ned’s comments highlights exactly the problem. Others join in: This is like saying if Jefferson Davis was alive today he would be for Black Lives Matter. https://t.co/YJLFZdWLFI  Martin Luther King Jr would have agreed 100% with me a white conservative Christian I say with unshakable confidence as seven live halibut slide moistly out the legs of my pleated khakis onto my blonde leather dockers. https://t.co/LshxAayVXo  my favorite thing about these ahistorical takes on MLK is that they act like he was murdered 200 years ago—y’all’s parents/grandparents were the ones complaining about him when he was alive 🙃 https://t.co/QspQkArYK0 Even I couldn’t resist a response. Wherein Ned Ryun proposes an alternative non-reality-based history in favor of real history to support claims against critical race theory. Ok then. #CRT #RememberHistory # https://t.co/zO2P8yoqvQ  Bernice King daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. delivers the knockout blow: I’m not sure how you arrived at this “100% guarantee” but I encourage you to study my father more fully and invite you to join @TheKingCenter tomorrow for our #virtual nonviolence series. Also please listen to ‘The Other America’: https://t.co/GRq5tT5wua (everyone should) #MLK https://t.co/dRQuVmnl3B  It is a terrible thing Ned when you forget that this is recent history and there are still people alive who remember what happened. It may be before me but it wasn’t before my parents—and that should tell you there are a whole lot of Americans alive who were here and would wildly disagree with your weird 100% take.
