L, Some States Are Vaccinating Foreign Tourists, mastergardener2k, 2021-04-23, It may seem paradoxical that with only 41% of the US population having received even one dose of Covid-19 vaccines some states have been freely giving vaccinations to foreign travelers. The US government does not officially condone vaccine tourism. That does not prevent tourists who “happen to be in the US” from getting an appointment from a state that allows any adult to get an injection. Apparently 16 states have no residency requirements though that number may change daily. Arizona Louisana and Texas are among the states using free Covid vaccinations to draw in international travelers from nations where the shots are not as easily available. The matter has a number of sides. Some areas of the US are not using all their doses and it would be a crime to waste them. (Of course US residents can travel for doses as well.) Tourism provides jobs and could help power a US economic rebound. Allowing foreign nationals to be vaccinated creates a more positive image of the US abroad. In a subtle way it could encourage more US residents to be vaccinated since the international tourists are willing to go so far to get a high quality vaccine. Requiring proof of residency has some down sides. www.traveloffpath.com/… States could easily prevent non-citizens from getting the vaccine by requiring proof of residency but that also poses a problem for undocumented immigrants. States want to vaccinate as many people as possible and according to American Progress undocumented immigrants make up 3.2% of the US population. That is over 10 million people living in the U.S. that would not qualify for the vaccine if proof of residency was required which would hamper vaccination efforts in some states.  Other states not requiring residency: Alabama California Colorado Indiana Iowa Michigan Nevada New Mexico Ohio South Carolina Virginia.  Alaska has announced its plan to use vaccines to bring in international money. www.msn.com/… If you’re the type of multitasker who’d combine an adventure to Denali National Park and Preserve with acquired immunity Alaska has the deal for you: Starting June 1 the state will be offering free COVID-19 vaccinations to travelers at its largest airports… Alaska’s vaccination program will be available at the Anchorage Fairbanks Juneau and Ketchikan airports outside of security areas. This way state residents can get their shot if they’re picking up friends or family at the airport. Alaska officials are planning a soft rollout of their vaccine plan at the end of April. As for US residents the pace of vaccinations are slowing somewhat as those who were most eager to be vaccinated have mostly been taken care of. Average daily vaccinations has fallen to just under 3 million per day. Joe Biden’s goal of 200 million vaccinations in his first 100 days has been met eight days early. Among senior Americans 81% have claimed at least one dose. Among all US residents 41.3% have had at least one jab and 52.6% of adult Americans have been given at least one injection.
