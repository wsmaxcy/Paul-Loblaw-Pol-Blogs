(Watch the clip below.) “Yesterday we heard from a whistleblower within the U.S. government who reached out to warn us that the NSA is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air” he said. Carlson a Fox News star who has pushed revisionist takes on the Capitol insurrection stoked fears over teaching students about racism and advanced anti-vaccine conspiracy theories said he had proof of government spying from his source who knew about a story the show is working on that could have only come from Carlson’s texts and emails. “The Biden administration is spying on us” Carlson declared. “We have confirmed that.” “Spying on opposition journalists is incompatible with democracy” he added. “This is scary and we need to stop it right away.”  Bradley P. Moss a lawyer specializing in national security expressed skepticism about Carlson’s pronouncement but allowed that “maybe his comms were picked up.” “Tucker is making serious accusations with no proof and is basing corroboration on a story he allegedly is working on that none of us know about” Moss tweeted.
