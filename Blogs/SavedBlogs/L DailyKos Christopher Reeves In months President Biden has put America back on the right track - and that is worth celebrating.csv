L, In months President Biden has put America back on the right track - and that is worth celebrating, Christopher Reeves, 2021-06-29, I could spend some time today going through the latest Republican scandal the last dumb thing said on Fox News or the latest MyPillow Guy theory. Instead I just wanted to point out something a bit different: Thanks to President Biden we are now living in a very different America. An America where Americans can find themselves gathered around a BBQ for the Fourth of July freely celebrating with family and friends. We now live in an America where the economy is coming back rather than cratering an America where the vaccine is being dished out as fast as people will accept it.  The Fourth of July brings many of us together with families using it for reunions or just a chance to catch up. President Trump’s inactions last year cost us hundreds of thousands of lives. Now as the economy comes back we’ve created some holes in our own economy and we’ve created new chances for people who couldn’t otherwise survive under COVID-19. President Biden though has reached out to the American public and delivered something we deeply missed: competence.  We gather at city services we plant flags we look at American moving forward. We’ve learned something America. We’ve learned what it means to stand tall and to be respected as a leader in the world again.  This Fourth of July we have a lot to celebrate. Former President Obama has the ability to celebrate a nation in good hands—and a birthday.  For everyone else we know there will be so much work ahead: a confrontational Senate a Supreme Court that has turned hard to the right and elections. Let me smile for just a bit about the fact that in a few months President Biden has done more for average Americans than President Trump did in four years.
