L, I believe something is going down on Wednesday I think., Joe Pac, 2021-04-25, I have no idea what they are talking about —  so do not ask me. I do know — they are well connected enough and are masters of the understatement thing or at least were. Worth paying attention to that day probably.  Should be an interesting day given their history of being total assholes toward the GOP. We are all about to find out in any event.  Wednesday. May be a very good day. They seem so cocky to me. This is a heads up.  Multiple sources confirming something BIG is coming this Wednesday.🏴‍☠️
