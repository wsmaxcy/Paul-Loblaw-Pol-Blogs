L, The FBI seizes records from Rudy Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office., annieliforTrump Russia Investigators, 2021-04-28, Feebs are closing in. Rudy’s electronic devices have now been seized in a NYC raid on his Manhattan apartment (and a Park Avenue office location). Darn that Deep State down by the Four Seasons Lawn Center. The buried lede is that the warrant was blocked under the former guy but Merrick Garland unblocked it.  Breaking: The FBI has seized records from Rudy Giuliani's Manhattan apartment. https://t.co/6wd2dvn7pV Executing a search warrant is an extraordinary move for prosecutors to take against a lawyer let alone a lawyer for a former president and it marks a major turning point in the long-running investigation into Mr. Giuliani. The United States Attorney’s office in Manhattan and the F.B.I. had for months sought to secure a search warrant for Mr. Giuliani’s phones. [...] The investigation of Mr. Giuliani grew out of a case against two Soviet-born men who aided his mission in Ukraine to unearth damaging information about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The prosecutors charged the two men Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman with unrelated crimes in late 2019 and a trial is scheduled for October. While investigating Mr. Giuliani prosecutors have examined among other things his potential business dealings in Ukraine and his role in pushing the Trump administration to oust the American ambassador to Ukraine which was the subject of testimony at Mr. Trump’s first impeachment trial. www.nytimes.com/...  So I guess Rudy Giuliani won’t be returning my call today.  (March) By early May 2019 former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani must have looked like the international espionage equivalent of a wide-eyed tourist walking around with his wallet hanging out his back pocket. He’d announced his intention to travel to Ukraine to seek out derogatory information about Joe Biden then a newly announced presidential candidate and someone well positioned to face President Donald Trump then Giuliani’s boss in the 2020 election. For any Russian officials interested in finding a conduit for misinformation that both cast their geopolitical rival Ukraine as corrupt and bolstered Trump’s chances of reelection Giuliani must have been an irresistible target. A report released by the Director of National Intelligence on Tuesday strongly suggests that this is exactly what happened. Giuliani spent months explicitly arguing that Biden’s son Hunter had engaged in dubious activity while serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. This claim was fact-checked over and over again particularly as Trump faced impeachment for his efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation of the Bidens. At no point did credible evidence emerge to suggest that the core claims being rigorously promoted by Giuliani and Trump were accurate. Giuliani nonetheless continued to hammer on the allegations repeatedly insisting that he had provided or would provide evidence to prove wrongdoing. www.washingtonpost.com/…  Time will tell whether they have enough to get Rudy or not but the decision by the Trump DOJ not to go forward with this step - over the objection of career attorneys - looks even sketchier now. https://t.co/vT00duBU4g  The right-wing nutters insist on the “secret government” in charge rather than POTUS Biden and even that previous guy waits in the wings for a triumphant return. He’s not even with buying an Arizona audit.  OAN report says auditors in Arizona are using UV light to look for watermarks on ballotsA debunked QAnon conspiracy theory after the 2020 election was that Trump secretly watermarked mail-in ballots https://t.co/4YzIKlu7gD  She’s nuts. And desperate."I know this": Kimberly Guilfoyle claims that Kamala Harris is secretly in charge of the White House - Salon https://t.co/STSFh8xWCE Indeed Guilfoyle first met Harris over twenty years ago. Back then Guilfoyle was dating Gavin Newsom the current Democratic governor of California. The two were married in 2001 and Guilfoyle became the first lady of San Francisco when he was sworn in as mayor in 2004. They went on to divorce in 2006. But it is difficult to imagine how Guilfoyle now has insight into the inner workings of the Biden White House which she sought to block from happening while being paid by the re-election campaign of her boyfriend's father. Kimberly Guilfoyle will serve as national chair of the Senate bid for Eric Greitens the disgraced former GOP governor of Missouri who resigned from office in 2018 following a probe into alleged sexual and campaign misconduct. https://t.co/Xlfr6L3Epc    The Giuliani Ukraine matter has 2 lanes:1. His efforts to secure allegations against the Bidens. Tapes exist that Ukraine President's advisors call shocking.2. Failure to register as a foreign agent - a crime itself - but one that can also lead to tax and wire fraud charges.    I think we can rule out at this point the idea that Rudy got a secret pardon from Trump. This would never have gotten this far. It would have been shut down internally. https://t.co/fbYq7aoSMA   Dear law students: don’t pull the “my client is too important/special to be investigated” card before you’ve pulled the “my client is completely innocent” card. https://t.co/6EcQiEtTW2    Giuliani's lawyer tells WSJ that search warrant seeks "communications between Mr. Giuliani and individuals including John Solomon."WSJ NYT CNN point to investigation of activities with Ukraine.Reminder of Giuliani-Solomon-Devin Nunes Timeline👇https://t.co/6LmTrXJ7My   I’ve spoken to multiple witnesses in the Giuliani investigation. More to come soon. For now flagging the news that Victoria Toensing the former lawyer for Dmitry Firtash also had her phone seized today. Background on their relationship here: https://t.co/NMmCimTAIz  Interesting suggestion from lead impeachment counsel @danielsgoldman: Feds may be examining whether Ukrainians may have paid Giuliani to use influence with Trump to oust Yovanovitch.We interviewed Goldman for help unpacking the Rudy search-warrant news:https://t.co/I3676DFw4j   Analysis: A timeline of Giuliani’s dubious interactions with the Trump administration https://t.co/cDZlX2y8rf   Zafonte arranged a call between Giuliani and MIKE POMPEO at the State Dept. as part of the Russian Mob/intel-coordinated plot to attack the 2020 election. So he's toast too. https://t.co/HF8x8qVL9O   10/ So one interesting aspect of this investigation is that it is related to the first impeachment inquiry. The Trump White House's efforts to obstruct that inquiry while unlikely to be chargeable may have been meant in part to stymie an investigation of Giuliani. /end   Trump on Fox: “Rudy Giuliani is a great patriot he does these things he just loves this country and they raid his apartment. It’s like so unfair and such a double standard ... like I don’t think anybody’s ever seen before.... I don’t know what they’re looking for”
