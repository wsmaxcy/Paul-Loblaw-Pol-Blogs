L, "Love It or Leave It" Jingoism at the Local Level, Perlinator, 2021-07-05, The American jingoistic mindset is pretty much like this:  “When you talk about America’s problems and how to solve them what you’re really saying is that you hate America!!! Don’t you dare talk about America having problems!!! Accept everything just the way it is!!! If you can’t do that pack your things and leave!!!”  I wonder why that sort of jingoism never seems to be used at the local level.
