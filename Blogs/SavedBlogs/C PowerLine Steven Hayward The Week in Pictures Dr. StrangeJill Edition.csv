C, The Week in Pictures: Dr. StrangeJill Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-07-03, This is the week we really learned that Doktor Jill Biden is in fact running the White House as the reincarnation of Edith Wilson. We know this because Vogue magazine which put her on the cover of the current issue wearing a picnic tablecloth called her a “goddess in stilettos.” We think they means shoes with the reference to “stilettos” but better check with Kamala Harris about that as she’s got a thin knife stuck in her back by someone. Who might that be?                                             Headlines of the week:                         Same story revised headline. Always covering their tracks. And as if you needed any more evidence of what horrible people run our major media:                              And finally. . .    Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
