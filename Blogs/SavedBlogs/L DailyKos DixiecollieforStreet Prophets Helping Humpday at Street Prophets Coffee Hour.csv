L, Helping Humpday at Street Prophets Coffee Hour, DixiecollieforStreet Prophets, 2021-07-07, HHday resides at the Street Prophets Coffee Hour the intersection where politics and religion and faith and history and ethical values and art and serendipity conveniently meet and sometimes collide. This is an open thread. Here’s what we do and why we do it: Humpday — because we’re smack dab in the middle of the work week and getting over that hump sure looks sweet. But for some folks in this community the humps they need to get over are far more daunting than looking forward to the weekend. That is where Helping comes in. Helping Humpday is specifically about generating community support for struggling Kossacks who find themselves facing an imminent financial need like keeping the lights on avoiding eviction getting to work paying medical bills. Our goal is to publicize the Community Needs List and other fundraisers for needy Kossacks as widely across the site as possible. Our motto is simple: many hands make light work.  The folks on the Community Needs List are struggling. Some need help with a one-time emergency. Others have struggled for months. They are working towards financial independence and self-sufficiency but still need some help. Your small gift can help a family or individual find stability for another month in the face of a crisis.  Even $3 or $5 or $10 helps. It all adds up. Thank you so much. Also tip rec comment here and in the individual diaries. Share on social media. That helps spread the word. Living on the financial edge—need help?

If helping financially isn’t the right option for you — or you want to do more — then be the link between need and fulfillment. If you are active on Social Media go to the linked fund-raising pages on the Needs List and use the social media icons on the page to share it throughout your contacts on Facebook Twitter whatever platform you use. If you are active on DKOS and it is appropriate for your members republish this diary to your groups and tip comment rec so it stays on the sidebar as long as possible. What’s the philosophy behind the Community Needs List? I will let bfitzinAR the original founder of Helping Humpday speak for us: Kossacks taking care of our own — helping by sharing/donating money or needed items helping by sharing both donation site links and artisan/vendor site links and purchasing gifts for self or others via those links helping by sharing knowledge and informational links or helping by just sharing a hug or a cup of coffee as appropriate — is what community is all about. We are community — clan tribe company village culture and state. Community survives beyond the life of any single member and thrives by supporting and strengthening the life of each individual member — by helping each other by sharing — all together. Until such time as we get the government that we want and deserve when there will be no need for fundraisers there will always be some Kossacks who need the help and compassion of this kind friendly and generous community.  Today’s selection is another from the way back machine The Beatles Help!
