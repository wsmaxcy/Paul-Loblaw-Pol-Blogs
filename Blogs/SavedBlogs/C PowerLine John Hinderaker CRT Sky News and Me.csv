C, CRT Sky News and Me, John Hinderaker, 2021-07-07, Critical Race Theory will be a key issue in the 2022 election and it has become an international issue as well. Last night I appeared on The Bolt Report with Andrew Bolt on Sky News in Australia talking about CRT in the U.S. It was a good conversation as always with Andrew and I thought our readers might enjoy it:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
