L, Political criminality is a soul sucking vampire, Indicted Donald, 2021-06-30, Let’s keep things in perspective as we eagerly await the first Trump World indictments dropping tomorrow.   Breaking: The Trump Organization and its CFO are expected to be charged with tax-related crimes by Manhattan prosecutors Thursday people familiar with the matter say https://t.co/c2hytCTwl0  Although it’s reportedly just the Trump Organization and its CFO facing some accountability on Thursday it’s a welcome start.  Politicians committing crimes is awful. A charging document by itself is not justice. And the prospect of politicians committing crimes and ultimately facing no penalty or accountability because they are powerful politicians is a particularly toxic venom. Political criminality is a soul sucking vampire.   It’s not just Republicans who commit crimes while in office. Democrats do too. All political corruption and abuse of power is horrifying.  As private citizens what can we do to help ourselves navigate this never-ending horror show? We cannot directly influence our justice system. And make no mistake that’s a good thing. Imagine the disaster if mob rule ruled our justice system. Justice in America must be independent.  I’m going be on guard against a growing sense of enraging helplessness as I watch this unfold from the sidelines. I know bringing Trump World to justice in 2021 and beyond is going to be a marathon not a sprint.  If in the end the prosecutor’s evidence wins the day this vampire gets a stake through its heart and I’ll breathe a little more life back into my soul.
