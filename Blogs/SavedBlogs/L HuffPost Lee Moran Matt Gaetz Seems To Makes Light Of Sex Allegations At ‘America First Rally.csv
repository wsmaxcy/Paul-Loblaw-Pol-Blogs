L, Matt Gaetz Seems To Makes Light Of Sex Allegations At ‘America First' Rally, Lee Moran, 2021-05-08, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) appeared to reference the sex allegations leveled against him during a rally with QAnon conspiracy theory-endorsing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) in Florida on Friday. The firebrand Republicans — and staunch supporters of ex-President Donald Trump ― visited The Villages retirement community north of Orlando for the first stop of their “America First Tour.” “CNN is just the worst” Gaetz told attendees. “So today is my birthday. And I already know how CNN’s gonna report it. ‘Matt Gaetz has wild party surrounded by beautiful women in The Villages.’ So just get ready for it” he added.

The Florida Republican has not been charged and denies any wrongdoing. “We have a right to confront our accusers in this country. How about that?” Gaetz told the crowd. “There can be no due process here if the only process due to conservatives is to see leaks embroidered onto lies then just endlessly repeated by the ‘America Last’ media.” Matt Gaetz portrays the FBI investigation of him as a politically motivated witch hunt ignoring that it started during the Trump administration pic.twitter.com/ejk94aNbyB Gaetz also claimed he was “a marked man in Congress.” “I’m a canceled man in some corners of the internet” he said. “I may be a wanted man by the deep state but I’m a Florida man and it’s good to be home.” .@RandiKayeCNN describes a "lovefest" between GOP Reps.

Tell me who is your president?” she asked. When the crowd responded “Trump” she said: “That’s my president too. I just want to be sure I’m with friends and family not with antifa or BLM or democratic socialists.”
