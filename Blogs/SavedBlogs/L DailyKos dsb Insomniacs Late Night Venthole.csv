I only had half a weekend because I had a work project due Saturday and it took me from 8am til 7pm to finish it. While procrastinating on it last week I performed a cursory literature review with Professor Google and learned I’m not the only one procrastinating more in covid-times. And I found out there’s a name for a special kind of procrastinating that a lot of my friends have too though some (not I) have gotten better over recent months: revenge bedtime procrastination. Now that I know I have these things maybe I can address the underlying causes and have less stress get more and better sleep be more productive during work hours… naaah. Friday night was so windy and foggy we didn’t walk on the beach but instead trekked down the closed highway had cocktails outside at the Riptide walked a couple miles back to our cars.  Saturday night I walked in the neighborhood with friends and had a drink ran into DD in the neighborhood that was nice. Took a lovely arboretum walk Sunday. The weather’s been stellar the last couple of days warm and clear. Windy though. Still smiling! Laughed and cried listening to this today.
