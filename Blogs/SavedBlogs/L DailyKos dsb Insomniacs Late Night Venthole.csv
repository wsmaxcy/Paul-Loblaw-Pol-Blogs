It rained a little yesterday. Hardly made a dent in the drought I don't think  but it made for a beautiful evening so I walked up to Haight Street with a friend and we got mason jars of martinis at Zam Zam selling out the door and drank them in the Panhandle. I had done DD and her boyfriend a favor and he met me in the park with a quart of pozole he had just made. He is an excellent cook and YUM. So it was a good weekend. Gs are just one game back and they're ahead as I write 9-0 in the second 12-0 in the seventh inning poor Rockies.
