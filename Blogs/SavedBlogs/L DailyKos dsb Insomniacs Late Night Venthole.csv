I’ve never watched his show though as I’ve never had cable and truth be told looking at clips is far from my favorite pastime after spending week after week on Zoom. I did look at some on YouTube today pretty funny. Here’s one I liked even though I didn’t know the guy involved who is apparently a 26-year writer & producer for O’Brien.   In other news Welp. My mom died yesterday Sunday June 27. I had sat with her a while the previous few days after she apparently had another little stroke-like event Wednesday and could no longer swallow. It was touch and go but she was too weak. She was 98. I think she spent her last few days with her mom of whom she often spoke when time-travelling in recent years. Hope so. I’m fine my family is okay. My DD came with me Friday to sit with Ma and then yesterday she and her boyfriend came over and hung out with me a while after I got home from seeing the old lady out and emptying her room. I mean it’s all fucking sad sometimes what are ya gonna do. My sibs and I have had some laughs in the last couple of days. My mom could be funny when she wasn’t being mean and even in dementia kept her sense of humor. She lost the meanness in her final years and kept her caregivers pretty well entertained. She was well loved and cared for by them in the little home I finally found for her the last three or four years.
