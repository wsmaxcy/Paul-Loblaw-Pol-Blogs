L, The Shooting of Daunte Wright is an Important Story; Let's Get the Facts Straight., Wendy Raschke, 2021-04-18, I have been reading the Daily Kos postings about the shooting of Daunte Wright and some of information in the postings is missing or not accurate. First Daunte Wright was pulled over for having expired license tabs not for having an air freshener hanging from his rear view mirror. The officers noticed the air freshener when they were walking to his stopped car and mentioned it then. When the officers ran his license plate they found the Daunte had an outstanding warrant for missing a court appearance regarding illegal possession of a firearm. That is why they tried to arrest him. Daunte at first cooperated with the officers but then broke away and got back in his car to drive away. That is when the officer yelled that she was going to “Tazer him” and after she yelled  “Taze! Taze! Taze!” she shot him with her service revolver. The officer then said “Oh shit. I shot him.” Daunte’s car drove a couple of blocks before it stopped. What happened was a tragedy. Daunte should never have been shot. But let’s not exploit a terrible situation by claiming that he was stopped for having an air freshener hanging from his rear view mirror. Let’s remember why the police were arresting him which was because he had an outstanding warrant for not showing up for a court hearing involving illegal possession of a firearm. And let’s remember that the police officer who shot Daunte behaved after the shooting as if she had meant to use her tazer not her service revolver. She is still responsible for his death and should pay the legal consequences for what she has done. Nothing at this point will bring Daunte back. The actions of those protesters who are not being peaceful and who are vandalizing and looting in the neighborhood around the police station are making life miserable for the innocent people who live in that area and for the business owners and employees who can no longer have their businesses open. The violent behavior of some protestors is wrong and will not bring Daunte back either. The information I am providing is from the early newscasts of the event and from body camera footage of the event.
