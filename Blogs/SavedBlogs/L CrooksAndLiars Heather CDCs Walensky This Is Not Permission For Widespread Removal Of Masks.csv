L, CDC's Walensky: 'This Is Not Permission For Widespread Removal Of Masks', Heather, 2021-05-16, Good luck when you've got propaganda networks like Fox that were immediately telling the unvaccinated that they don't need to wear masks. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky was asked about the new guidance on face masks during an interview on ABC's This Week and she made clear the guidance is "not permission for widespread removal of masks." DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY CDC: So this is a really important point and that is the guidance that we released on Thursday is about individuals and what individuals are at risk of doing if they are not vaccinated. If they're vaccinated they are safe. If they are not vaccinated they are not safe. They should still be wearing a mask or better yet get vaccinated. We also need to say that this is not permission for widespread removal of masks. For those who are vaccinated it may take some time for them to feel comfortable removing their masks but also that these decisions have to be made at the jurisdictional level at the community level. Some communities have been hit harder than others have lower vaccination rates than others. We want to deliver the science at the individual level but we also understand that these decisions have to be made at the community level. Essential workers are concerned about the CDC's new mask guidance and for good reason. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
