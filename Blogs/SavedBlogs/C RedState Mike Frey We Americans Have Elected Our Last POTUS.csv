C, We Americans Have Elected Our Last POTUS, Mike Frey, 2020-11-04, As we wait to see how this 2020 General Election shakes out I realized that unless significant changes are made to restore our election integrity and restrain subversive influences we the people are done electing our President of the United States.  A sizable minority of the population may even think they have this freedom but they will be deluding themselves.  They got the outcome they wanted but only because they wanted what the machine wanted.  The machine will win. It’s unclear at this point whether the last one that “we the people” elected was in 2016 or in 2020 but we could not have fully lost control of the candidate elected earlier than 2016 – there is no way that any of the forces seeking to subvert our constitutional republic would have chosen Donald Trump.  They did want him in the Primary but certainly not the General.  And if we do indeed elect Donald Trump in 2020 there is no way moving forward that we will encounter such favorable conditions to prevail against those same forces as we did this year in 2020. Freedom cannot have a bigger advocate than Donald Trump.  I assert this considering firstly his intent but also by necessity temperament and ability.  No president in my lifetime has been a better restorative force toward the constitution and its freedoms than Donald Trump.  I loved Reagan of course but it seems to me that Donald Trump has achieved more in his first term and with unbelievable (and illegal) headwinds. On the other hand while all the progressive candidates are nightmarish for the country some (Obama) do a better job of hiding their horribleness from voters.  Hillary was a hideous corrupt candidate.  Biden (Biden/Harris/Pelosi) is even more transparently corrupt less capable of coherent thought and a trojan horse for God-knows-what or -whom.  If this election can be this close they can only get worse from here. Unless.  We need to treat elections as if the American Experiment and our freedoms depend on them – because they clearly do. Here’s my proposed list of “MUSTS” going forward: These “election” protections need to be coupled with “democracy” protections.  I’m not trying to hit an exhaustive list here but hey some of this is easy. These reforms may seem easy impossible I don’t know.  But I do know if we don’t get a hold of this we are not holding free elections in the United States of America.
