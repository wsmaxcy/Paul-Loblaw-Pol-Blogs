L, The Inoculation Project 5/9/2021: Books and More Books!, belinda ridgewoodforThe Inoculation Project, 2021-05-09, This week we’re helping two classrooms that need books: a Florida fifth grade studying space exploration and an Ohio fourth grade needing a couple of novels the class will love.  We hope that readers who support quality public school education will help by sharing or supporting our featured projects. The Inoculation Project is an ongoing volunteer effort to crowdfund science and math projects for red-state public schools in low-income neighborhoods. As always our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that facilitates tax-deductible donations to specific vetted projects in public schools.  My mom isn’t here to get a card or a gift for Mothers’ Day so the best way I can honor her memory is to work on getting some books into kids’ hands as that was her great passion as a teacher and school librarian. She certainly got a lot of them into my hands along the way and what a gift that was to me! So I owe her. Both of these projects may (or may not) take us a little while but that’s okay. Mrs. Dorminey teaches fifth grade in a tiny town on the Florida Gulf Coast north of Tampa. She needs some books about space exploration for her students including some that will show them that the heroes of space exploration can be people who look like them. Resources:  Help me give my students science books that bring the history of space exploration to life! Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location: Yankeetown School Yankeetown Florida Total:  $435.41 Still Needed:  $226.59 Completed thanks! Please see next project. Teacher’s Comments from Mrs. Dorminey: My Students:  My students are kind and natural leaders. They love to come to school. They are always getting recognized for their excellent attendance rates. Despite coming from a rural area they find a way to get to school every day. All of my students are fascinated with technology and dream of a life filled with it. They aspire to do great things and when asked what they want to be when they grow up they know math and science are in every essential career. Most of my students only have access to technology at school. My students are explorers. They are full of grit and drive to do better. They know the way to living their best life is through hard work. Their education is their ticket to go anywhere! My Project:  One of the most exciting times during the school year is when we are studying Earth in space. Students love to hear the story of how we have traveled to the moon and soon will be on Mars! Students in my class are encouraged to read when they are finished with their classwork. Filling the shelves with as many interesting and educational books helps me foster a love of space reading and science in my class. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!  This Cleveland fourth-grade teacher sees the writing on the wall: everyone will be back in the classroom in the fall with or without vaccinations. She needs enough books for everyone to get their own copy. Resources:  Help me give my students the books Clean Get Away and Regarding the Fountain so they have their own individual copy. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  Campus International School K-8 Cleveland Ohio Total:  $422.79 Still Needed:  $357.79  $267.79 Teacher’s Comments from Ms. Kaminski: My Students:  I love working at our school because the student population is diverse. We educate students from different socioeconomic backgrounds cultures belief systems and skill levels. We are an International Baccalaureate School. Our goal is to prepare our students to become global citizens through inquiry and exploring global perspectives. The majority of our learning is through cooperative experiences that are inclusive. All students have gifts to offer and actively participate. While furthering their understanding of content areas students also further their understanding of self and others. It is magical to watch our students learn. My Project:  When the pandemic began I never dreamed the effects it is having on education would linger for so long. There are still many uncertainties about what teaching will look like in the future. One thing for sure is that not all students will be vaccinated by our return to school in the fall. Individual copies of books are going to be a necessity. Reading novels is a powerful and constructive way to teach reading skills. Students show a higher interest in reading books that they can relate to and that appeal to their sense of adventure and humor. Both of these books match that criteria. These books will help students learn about people with unique personalities and how to build relationships with them. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!    Both of our projects from last week were completed many thanks to our readers! Mrs. Price’s small rural North Carolina elementary school also serves military families from Ft. Bragg. She needed Nearpod a powerful software platform that allows teachers to build interactive lessons incorporating many kinds of materials that can be used by students with the teacher in small groups or independently in school or remotely. The project was 21st Century Blended Learning with Nearpod! She writes:  Thank you ALL so much for your generous donations to this terrific project! Our students will benefit immensely from the use of this awesome platform. I'm excited to get working on lessons and resources for my students. We are all so appreciative of the support we receive from across the nation! Up in Cincinnati Mrs. Greeley Howard teaches at a STEM high school. She wanted her botany students to be able to do a lab teaching them about tissue-culture propagation of miniature roses. The project was Growing Roses Brings Smiles. She writes: Words cannot express how much my students and I appreciate your generosity. My students have really enjoyed learning soft skills of communications team work listening to others cooperation while reviewing science content during our Plant labs and asked for more hands on science classes. The students asked for their own plants and I am excited to be able to allow that to happen. I am so happy I am able to bring in the students innate appreciate of nature as well as their students love for discovery thanks to your generosity. Students were able to propagate at least 4 different types of plants as well as create a moss terrarium to enjoy for years to come! Your assistance in helping all of my students has touched my heart. The students are all asking if I am going to continue with hands on inquiry labs next year as they cannot wait for more learning!  Mrs. Heimann teaches science in a rural high school on the Texas Gulf Coast. Late in 2018 as her students’ families struggled to recover from Hurricane Harvey she needed microscopes and related supplies so her students could do lab work revealing the world to them at a cellular level. The project was A New View in Biology.  (More photos at the link.)  I would like to personally thank you for your donation towards new microscopes for my classroom. Your contribution has made a huge impact on my students and their studies. When the box arrived and I displayed the new equipment there was excitement in the air. My students became even more excited when I told them the new microscopes were also rechargeable and we could use them anywhere in the classroom. In addition to purchasing new microscopes we had enough funds to get new slides. To test out the new equipment we immediately did an exploration lab. Students obtained samples of water from different sources around the school. They were amazed at what they could see in the samples. I was also amazed by the quality of the microscopes and how clear the LED light made the object on the slide. Being able to move the microscopes around the room without the hindrance of a cord was an added benefit. Your donation has made a difference in my classroom! I can't wait to incorporate using microscopes into more lessons. I appreciate your thoughtfulness towards enriching my student's education.  Founded in 2009 The Inoculation Project combats the anti-science push in conservative America by funding science and math projects in red-state classrooms and libraries. Our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a crowdfunding charity founded in 2000 and highly rated by both Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau. Every Sunday we focus on helping to fund science or math projects preferably in neighborhood public schools where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income households. We welcome everyone who supports public school education — no money is required! Finally here’s our list of successfully funded projects — our series total is 896! The success-list diary also contains links and additional information about DonorsChoose.org.
