BREAKING: Supreme Court upholds Affordable Care Act.Justice Breyer delivers the opinion in California v. Texas: https://t.co/PkJN1sASfJ pic.twitter.com/h9LH7iDvSo — Bloomberg Law (@BLaw) June 17 2021 It was a stupid case brought by stupid people who had no standing in the court.   Well SCOTUS was willing to say the "standing" part out loud anyway.   The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act saying Republican-led states do not have the legal standing to try to upend the law. #Breaking #SCOTUS #ACA — David Pearson (@AHADaveReg7) June 17 2021 As Pete Williams pointed out the court did not recognize that the red states whining about the individual mandate were actually harmed by it.  Duh.  Several on Twitter noted that had the court decided to destroy the ACA that would lead to an inevitable expansion of the Supreme Court.  I admit I’m a little surprised that the right-wingers on #SCOTUS didn’t strap on an institutional suicide vest and blow up the ACA and the whole healthcare system with it. I guess they didn’t want to split office space with 15 new colleagues if they had. — Seize the Means of Distraction (@thatgeekinit) June 17 2021 It should be expanded anyway. There is absolutely no legal difference between McConnell using his Article II powers to maintain vacancies for Republican presidents and Congress using its Article III powers to expand the size of the Court. None. https://t.co/aP14oKgVgD — Scott Lemieux (@LemieuxLGM) June 14 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
