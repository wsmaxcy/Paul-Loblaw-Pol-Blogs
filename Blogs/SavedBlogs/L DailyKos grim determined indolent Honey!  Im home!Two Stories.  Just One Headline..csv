L, "Honey!  I'm home!"Two Stories.  Just One Headline., grim determined indolent, 2021-04-30, Story 1:  Apparently not much of a lawyer Kansas State Rep. Mark Samsel Q-Wellsville tried to make his mark as a substitute teacher.  And apparently Samsel did make a mark.  He spent some time in the Franklin County Jail yesterday and is facing charges for battering a student.  I too have spent some time in the Franklin County Jail.  Let me tell you it's nothing to write home about.  Samsel is no longer working for the school district.  This is new information since I wrote this story two or three hours ago.  And this is new.  Story 2 (which completely usurped the headline):  Current Kansas law shields spouses from prosecution for sexual battery. House Bill 2120 would make it a crime for one spouse to touch the other with the intent to arouse sexual desires without consent.  In a February 11 speech on the House floor Samsel cautioned his colleagues about the dangers of criminalizing “a routine act” between a husband and wife.  A third story concerning Kansas Republicans:  The Original Johnny Appleseed of Voter Suppression --Kris Kobach-- has named and appointed a Treasurer for a 2022 campaign for Attorney General.  More on that next week.
