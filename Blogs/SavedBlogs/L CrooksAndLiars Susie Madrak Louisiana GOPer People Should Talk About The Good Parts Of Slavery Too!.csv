L, Louisiana GOPer: People Should Talk About The Good Parts Of Slavery Too!, Susie Madrak, 2021-04-28, This Republican rep went viral yesterday for his attempt to explain how Louisiana teachers should handle talking about slavery. Via the Washington Post: When a Louisiana lawmaker questioned state Rep. Ray Garofalo Jr. (R) during a House committee meeting on Tuesday over his bill that would ban schools and colleges from teaching “divisive concepts” about race and sex Garofalo Jr. mentioned he didn’t “want to say anything I shouldn’t say.” Moments later though the chamber erupted when the GOP lawmaker tried to give examples of how he would like to see the state’s teachers discuss slavery. “If you are having a discussion on whatever the case may be on slavery then you can talk about everything dealing with slavery: the good the bad the ugly” Garofalo Jr. said. “There is no good to slavery though” Rep. Stephanie Hilferty (R) swiftly replied before the House burst into laughter. Garofalo Jr. did take back the comment saying he didn't mean to imply that. But it was too late. The internet did what the internet does. Free labor - the Republican ideal. — Psaki Bombs of Sanity (@mampdx) April 28 2021 What’s next? A unit on all the good of the Holocaust?  How about a comparative essay highlighting the good of them both? — Jay Starski (@wrongwayj) April 27 2021 The Lighter Side of Japanese Internment is an honors class I hear. — Tegan Price Harkness (@teganpharkness) April 27 2021 Yes but first you have to pass the How the Russian Jews Benefitted From The Pogroms honors class in order to qualify. — Jay Starski (@wrongwayj) April 28 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
