L, Republican Promises Bipartisanship On Immigration Really, Frances Langum, 03-16-21, Sorry Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks we simply don't believe you.   On Tuesday morning's CNN Newsroom the Iowa Congresswoman forgot for a moment that she wasn't on Fox.  She recently made a "fact-finding" trip to the US-Mexico border and came back repeating statements from "border patrol agents" that individuals on the "terror watch list" were crossing into the US.  She also reported on a "a large load of fentanyl." Jim Sciutto did his best but hey CNN bookers brought this person on the air.  That was the first mistake Jim.  Sciutto interrupted MMM to note that "people" on the "terror watch list" are coming over the border and that border patrol agents told her that "they had just apprehended and taken into possession a large load of fentanyl."  9/11!  Solyndra!   It really was as if for a moment she forgot she wasn't on Fox and Friends.  Thankfully Jim Sciutto reminded her and noted that she was actually quoting a talking point from the previous president that had been debunked by his own DHS.  Whoops!  So MMM changed tactics and suggested after a LOT of prompting from Sciutto that solving the problems at the border will require bipartisan compromise and actual passing of legislation by Congress!  And after the interview Jim Sciutto tried to hold her accountable on Twitter and she retweeted this!  So let's keep an eye on Mariannette Miller-Meeks.   —>> GOP @RepMMM tells me: “the immigration system has been broken for decades. This is not a new problem.” She adds there is “willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion” on legislation that addresses both border security and a path for Dreamers. — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) March 16 2021 Just kidding!  She's not going to vote against the will of her caucus!  She's a medical doctor who voted against COVID relief!   Maybe she should tell her caucus leader to stop calling it the Biden Border Crisis then. — JAO (@jao_1989) March 16 2021 PS.  Don't mess Jenn Budd's thread on how Border Patrol agents play the media and Congress:  5) Every single agent said to me that they were intentionally slow-walking the processing to create a backlog. They wanted to punish them. They wanted to make them give up & take a deport. They wanted them to call home & tell their families not to come. — Jenn Budd (@BuddJenn) March 16 2021 8) That’s the story here. Any outlet...right left or middle who does not call them on this is just helping them. These are people we are talking about. I think many of us have forgotten about this. They have dreams. They love. They breath just like you and I. — Jenn Budd (@BuddJenn) March 16 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
