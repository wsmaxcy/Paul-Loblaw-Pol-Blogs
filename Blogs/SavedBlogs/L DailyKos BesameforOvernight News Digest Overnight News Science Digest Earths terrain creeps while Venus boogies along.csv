L, Overnight News Science Digest: Earth's terrain creeps while Venus' boogies along, BesameforOvernight News Digest, 2021-06-26, Guess what? The New York Times doesn’t know how to spell “boogie” and their version has Venus picking its nose. This week’s science news discusses the landscapes of Earth and Venus discovery of a (maybe) new human species that could displace Neanderthal as our closest relative how glasswing butterflies make transparent wings elephant personalities where aliens could be hanging out to spy on Earth Arctic dinosaurs how to cure hiccups and more. Earth has plate tectonics the gradual migration of continent-size geologic jigsaw pieces on its surface. Venus has something else something quirkier. https://t.co/wCJR6dnEPJ  Earth and Venus are the same size are right next to each other and are made of the same star stuff. But Earth became an oasis while Venus became an acid-flecked inferno. Why? [...] Venus doesn’t have plate tectonics. But according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences it may possess a quirky variation of that process: Parts of its surface seem to be made up of blocks that have shifted and twisted about contorting their surroundings as they went. These boogying blocks thin and flat slices of rock referred to as campi (Latin for “fields”) can be as small as Ireland or as expansive as Alaska … These campi are bordered by lines of small mountain ranges and grooves features that have also been warped and scarred over time. What made them? According to Paul Byrne a planetary scientist at North Carolina State University and the study’s lead author there is only one reasonable explanation: Essentially dragged around by the flowing mantle below the campi “have been shimmying around the place just like pack ice.” Campi moving toward immobile land would cause the ground to crumple up forming mountains. One moving away would have stretched the land opening grooves. And along these boundaries campi moving side-to-side would have left strain marks and etchings.  “I remember listening and saying ‘This is really cool work.’ As an experimentalist I appreciate when people find new techniques to measure something that was previously hidden.” Landscapes around you may appear static but research using lasers suggests even the most steady terrain is creeping along. https://t.co/PdOZXK5GfB  Mountains look solid. But that just might be a mirage. On extremely long timescales natural landscapes are creeping and flowing like viscous streams. Until recently most scientists would have said that things like burrowing animals falling trees earthquakes and lightning strikes were responsible for deforming much of the world’s terrain. But new experiments that involve shooting ultraprecision laser beams at sand piles instead suggest that creep is an inherent part of any environment and would occur even in the absence of all other action. “Everything is moving all the time” said Nakul Deshpande a geophysics doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s not just an analogy. It’s real it’s what’s happening.”  OVERNIGHT NEWS DIGEST IS AN OPEN THREAD THAT WELCOMES EVERYONE ESPECIALLY NIGHT OWLS AND EARLY BIRDS. PLEASE SHARE ARTICLES THAT INTEREST YOU IN THE COMMENTS. “It’s just fascinating to know how nature solves really interesting problems like this. You can pay extra for glasses that have an antireflective coating on them. But of course essentially butterflies figured that out maybe tens of millions of years ago.” The glasswing butterfly (Greta oto) a baseball-size flier that lives throughout Central and South America is one of hundreds of butterfly species with transparent wings. This rare adaptation helps it evade potential predators. Compared with other see-through species such as dragonflies glasswings are even more adept at fluttering through the rainforest unnoticed because their wings don’t shine or glimmer in sunlight. [...] His students found that “every way you can think of being transparent some butterfly or moth has figured out” Patel says. A butterfly’s wings consist of a thin membranous layer of a natural polymer called chitin which is typically covered with tiny scales that resemble interlocking tiles. Species with transparent wings have found ways to move light around these scales producing fewer of them turning them vertically or simply getting rid of them. The group found that glasswings not only produce fewer scales but they also convert many of those scales into bristles allowing light to pass through the wings more easily. Using a scanning electron microscope Pomerantz also discovered that tiny mounds between the bristles known as nanopillars are coated in a layer of wax. Arguably the greatest mystery in sensory biology is magnetoreception — how animals sense Earth’s magnetic field and use it as a compass to determine their spatial orientation … The identity of the biological tissue responsible for sensing the field’s direction and the sensory mechanism that underpins this type of navigation have remained an enigma. In migratory birds the main contenders are magnetically sensitive proteins called cryptochromes which are located in the retina2. However proof has been lacking that these proteins truly possess the magnetic sensitivity and physical properties needed to detect Earth’s extremely weak magnetic field. Writing in Nature Xu et al.3 provide this proof in vitro bringing us tantalizingly close to solving the mystery of magnetoreception. There are currently two main hypotheses for how animals sense Earth’s magnetic field14 (as well as some alternative hypotheses put forward in the past few years56). One proposes that as an animal changes direction crystals of the oxidized-iron compound magnetite (Fe3O4) located in its body and aligned with the field exert a rotational force — called torque — on mechanoreceptors with which they are in physical contact. This might thereby signal changes in body alignment through the opening and closing of mechanoreceptor ion channels. The other main hypothesis (Fig. 1) proposes that when cryptochrome proteins absorb photons of light and become ‘photoexcited’ they form magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates known as radical pairs. Variations in the yield of their reaction product (the form of the cryptochrome that contains a radical molecule called FADH•) are thought to signal the animal’s direction with respect to Earth’s magnetic field78. Just as humans have their own individual personalities new research in the Journal of Comparative Psychology shows that elephants have personalities too. Moreover an elephant's personality may play an important role in how well that elephant can solve novel problems. [...] "Since we couldn't give the elephants a personality test like the ones you're familiar with online we had to think creatively." The authors developed novel object tests in which they presented the elephants with an unfamiliar object a mylar balloon a burned log and the scent of a predator (lion or hyena) and recorded the elephants' responses ... They also asked elephant caretakers to fill out a survey about the personalities of the animals in their care; and finally they observed the elephants interacting with one another in their zoo habitats. [...] This study makes connections between two sources of individual variation personality and cognition in threatened species. One reason it is important to examine problem-solving in elephants is that they are faced with new problems that they need to solve regularly in the wild. For example if certain traits enable elephants to overcome novel problems elephants may be more likely to invade farmland and contribute to human-elephant conflict. With more research managers can predict which elephants might overcome or habituate to deterrents and managers can devote more resources to tracking elephants. Scientists at Cornell University and the American Museum of Natural History have identified 2034 nearby star-systems -- within the small cosmic distance of 326 light-years -- that could find Earth merely by watching our pale blue dot cross our sun. That's 1715 star-systems that could have spotted Earth since human civilization blossomed about 5000 years ago and 319 more star-systems that will be added over the next 5000 years. Exoplanets around these nearby stars have a cosmic front-row seat to see if Earth holds life the scientists said in research published June 23 in Nature. "From the exoplanets' point-of-view we are the aliens" said Lisa Kaltenegger professor of astronomy and director of Cornell's Carl Sagan Institute in the College of Arts and Sciences. "We wanted to know which stars have the right vantage point to see Earth as it blocks the Sun's light" she said. "And because stars move in our dynamic cosmos this vantage point is gained and lost." This is terrible for the whales off Whidbey Island. The lower southern resident orcas struggle as is. Shipping makes it worse.https://t.co/7yVC8TxVLu  Whidbey Island is a lovely place about 30 miles north of Seattle on the Puget Sound. Most days the tranquil sounds of rolling waves and chirping birds provide an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. But these days all is not so serene. Residents are complaining about the ruckus created by humongous container ships anchored off their shore. "We've never seen them this close before" a Whidbey Islander told a local news station. "We're hearing the throbbing noise at night. ... It's a nuisance." The noise has been so loud that residents have been complaining to the county sheriff's office about it. Whidbey Islanders are getting a front row seat to the growing U.S. trade deficit which is hitting record highs. It's fueled by a surge in demand for imports mostly from East Asia. There's so much cargo being shipped to the U.S. from Asia right now that the ports of Seattle and Tacoma are chock-full of container ships.  "A co-production of knowledge consisting of traditional holders and scientists can outline harvesting practices and the recovery actions." Are the traditional practices tied to endangered species at risk of being lost? The answer is yes according to the authors of an ethnographic study published in the University of Guam peer-reviewed journal Pacific Asia Inquiry. But the authors also say a recovery plan can protect both the species as well as the traditional CHamoru practice of consuming them. The researchers interviewed CHamorus about their recollections of preparing and eating the endangered fanihi the fruit bat found only in the Mariana Islands and the endangered fadang a cycad endemic to Micronesia as sources of food. "Gathering and processing the [fadang] seeds into titiyas fadang was a family activity. Manåmko' spoke vividly about their exquisite taste and smell during my ethnobotanical research" Demeulenaere said. "CHamoru conservation managers told me they were afraid their kids would never acquire the taste of fanihi and hoped that one day the fanihi population would be restored so they could hunt them sustainably and restore this traditional practice." Breaking News: Scientists announced that a massive fossilized skull that is at least 140000 years old may be a new species of ancient human. The researchers named the new species Homo longi and gave it the nickname “Dragon Man." https://t.co/ejyHHl5IGD  The skull belonged to a mature male who had a huge brain massive brow ridges deep set eyes and a bulbous nose. It had remained hidden in an abandoned well for 85 years after a laborer came across it at a construction site in China. The researchers named the new species Homo longi and gave it the nickname “Dragon Man” for the Dragon River region of northeast China where the skull was discovered. The team said that Homo longi and not the Neanderthals was the extinct human species mostly closely related to our own. If confirmed that would change how scientists envision the origin of Homo sapiens which has been built up over the years from fossil discoveries and the analysis of ancient DNA. But a number of experts disputed this conclusion published in three papers that provided the first detailed look at the fossil. Nevertheless many still thought that the find could help scientists reconstruct the human family tree and how modern humans emerged. All the experts who reviewed the data in the studies said it was a magnificent fossil.  Dinosaurs didn’t just summer in the high Arctic; they may have lived there year-round new fossil evidence suggests. Hundreds of bones and teeth found along the Colville River in northern Alaska belonged to dinosaur hatchlings researchers say. The remains which fell from outcroppings of the Prince Creek Formation represent seven dinosaur families including tyrannosaurs duck-billed hadrosaurs and horned and frilled ceratopsids. “These are the northernmost [non-avian] dinosaurs that we know of” says paleontologist Patrick Druckenmiller of the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks. And now it’s clear they’re not just migrating into polar latitudes he says. “They’re actually nesting and laying and incubating eggs … practically at the North Pole.” A new study offers quantitative evidence linking psychological stress to graying hair in people. The study published June 22 in eLife has broader significance than confirming age-old speculation about the effects of stress on hair color says the study's senior author Martin Picard PhD(link is external and opens in a new window) associate professor of behavioral medicine (in psychiatry and neurology) at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. "Understanding the mechanisms that allow 'old' gray hairs to return to their 'young' pigmented states could yield new clues about the malleability of human aging in general and how it is influenced by stress" Picard says. "Our data add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that human aging is not a linear fixed biological process but may at least in part be halted or even temporarily reversed." BBC Guinness medical record breakers - “Charles Osborne (1894-1991) of Anthon Iowa the US started hiccupping in 1922 while attempting to weigh a hog before slaughtering it. He was unable to find a cure and continued hiccupping until February 1990 a total of 68 years. During the first few decades he hiccupped up to 40 times a minute slowing to 20 a minute in later years.”  Drinking straw device ‘instant’ cure for hiccups say scientists https://t.co/7Q1VoJXQvh
