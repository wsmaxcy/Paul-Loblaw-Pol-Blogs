L, Not today! Kansas legislature fails to override Gov. Kelly's veto on trans hate legislation, Christopher Reeves, 2021-05-04, The Kansas legislature returned to the statehouse on Monday as vetoes from the governor were presented for override something that was certainly possible with a Republican supermajority House and Senate. Republicans succeeded in almost every attempt: Gadsen flag license plates the ability to use COVID-19 federal funding for corporate tax giveaways permitting guns on campus and concealed carry for those 18 years and older. One battle however—the one that Republicans may have wanted most—struck out: Republicans failed to pass their anti-transgender K-12 legislation which would have allowed genital inspections of girls as young as 5 years old based on accusations of another parent.    Anti-trans SB55 is dead! The Senate killed it so it won’t go to the house. More later. Thank you to Governor Kelly and all the Senators who voted to sustain the Governor’s veto! #ProtectTransYouth  Don’t worry though Republicans are committed to continue trying. From The Kansas City Star: Despite the bill’s failure Sen. Renee Erickson a Wichita Republican and Brittany Jones of the Family Policy Alliance of Kansas each said they would continue pushing for the policy in this session and in the future. It is likely to be a campaign issue in 2022. “This is an issue Kansans care about this is an issue that Kansans will make decisions on who they want representing them in the Legislature and as Governor” Jones said. Sen. Renee Erickson who had introduced the bill was largely coached through the process by Sen. Molly Baumgardner. Throughout the process the goal was to create an incendiary environment not aimed at creating good policy but at winning over Republicans who wanted to use fear as their goal. Sadly many of the Republicans knew better. Sen. Kellie Warren who is looking at running for state attorney general had to be aware the legislation would quickly be litigated and the cost to Kansas from the NCAA could be high.  Kansas Republicans seemed to not mind the issue inviting South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to appear at their state convention only a short while after she vetoed nearly identical legislation in South Dakota citing concerns that the legislation would not remove impacts on colleges. And her [Noem] efforts to remove college sports from the legislation came amid threats from the NCAA to remove its national championships from states which approve the laws. Noem weighed concerns the bill was "vague and overly broad language could have significant unintended consequences." That would include a potential legal minefield with a similar law in Idaho struck down by a federal court pending appeal. Despite the fact that several Republicans have direct involvement in their local community colleges they had no problem writing legislation that tasked their colleges with discriminating against their own students sometimes in the exact reverse of the stated policy of the college itself. From the bill:  (2) The state board of regents and the governing body for each municipal universitycommunity college and technical college shall adopt rules and regulations for the postecondaryeducational institutions governed by each such entity respectively for the implementation of thissection Baumgardner is the communications director at the largest community college in the state of Kansas which has recently adopted a more progressive policy on inclusion. She found herself behind the machinery on pushing hate legislation while being employed in a job advocating the opposite.  Republicans will decry these results. They will work tirelessly to overturn them in the years ahead. For today however Kansas LGBTQ students know that the continued bullying and lie campaign against them had allies who stood up and pushed back scoring a victory in Topeka.
