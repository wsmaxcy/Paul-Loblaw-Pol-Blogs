L, VA-Gov: Trump & Ted Cruz's GOP Candidate Refers To Asian Americans As "Yellow Americans", poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-30, Kudos to Josh Israel from The American Independent for flagging this:  Virginia GOP candidate for governor calls Asian Americans 'yellow' in April interview by @jeisrael https://t.co/KVMdHRJTae  Appearing on Republican strategist Chris Arps' "Water Cooler Politics" podcast Glenn Youngkin said "I think we need to find ways to bring us together to bring us together and recognize that we are one body." "I so look forward to being governor and actually working hard to unleash the potential of all Virginians of all Virginians so that people — so that our children can run as fast as they can. So that all Virginians — Black Virginians brown Virginians white Virginians yellow Virginians — can all achieve their aspirations and their ambitions. And this is what America is about. This is what Virginia should be about." The term "yellow" has long been used as a slur to describe people of Asian and Pacific Island decent. The anti-racism group The Yellow Whistle notes that while "In nature yellow is the color of daffodils and sunflowers" in the United States "yellow has been weaponized against Asians as the color of xenophobia." FYI: Today the AAPI Victory Fund and partner APPI organizations Korean Americans for Biden Democratic Asian Americans of Virginia They See Blue Korean Americans for Organizing and South Asians for America (SAFA) publicly endorsed Virginia candidates Terry McAuliffe for governor Hala Ayala for Lieutenant Governor and Mark Herring for Attorney General.  As AAPI Victory Fund continues to engage and empower progressive AAPI voters to be the margin of victory at all levels of the ballot each candidate — all three of whom have pledged to prioritize concerns near and dear to the AAPI community such as stopping AAPI hate and investing in AAPI communities —will be critical in laying the groundwork to fortify equitize and expand the political power of AAPIs across the state of Virginia for years to come.  In the 2019 Virginia elections AAPI turnout increased a staggering 241% from 2015. AAPI’s represented 2.1% of Virginia voters but 10% of the Virginia electorate. AAPI voters consistently punch above our weight. Democracy is on the ballot and we can’t allow Trump’s candidate to become Governor of Virginia.
