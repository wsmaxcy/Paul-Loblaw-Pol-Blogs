L, Budget Matters in the Backyard Garden, Rexxmama, 2021-04-19,    When the weather is cold and damp I don’t spend much time outside. Old joints prefer to operate in warm and dry conditions and protest loudly when forced to move in uncomfortable circumstances. But I recognize that the Current Administration needs to tackle the lingering workforce discrimination issues disregarded by Former Gardener who relied deeply on Hubby Across the Aisle to shoulder the grunt work of weed elimination grass-blade height adjusting and the heavy lifting involved repairing breaches in the flowerbed borders.    The recent Partisan-passed Backyard Rescue Plan addresses issues involving jobs and labor as well as providing more funding for infrastructure. Despite the Fiscal Policy differences I have with Hubby A.t.A. special funding needs make themselves known. Ongoing infrastructure maintenance — like potholes in pavement or seedlings in gardens — are expected and to some extent specified in the budget. But now and then the unexpected crops up — a deteriorated bridge that finally collapses for example — and such incidents exact an additional toll on the budget’s bottom line.    The unexpected happened today.    For background: In the Backyard Garden we employ as many environmentally-friendly and neighbor-friendly methods and products as possible. We reuse and recycle. We embrace the Green Revolution and not just as the predominant garden plant color. We do not employ harmful chemicals nor do we knowingly use fossil fuels for power tools. Accordingly our lawn mower choice has always been a classic reel push mower. 100% human-powered.    Disclosure: Hubby A.t.A. and I have differing philosophies about how to operate a lawn mower. The Current Administration advocates a calm mostly-spiral path around the yard starting at the outside edges and working one’s way to the middle grounds for a consistent and even pattern of mown lawn. The Across the Aisle Caucus prefers kamikaze attacks on gerrymandered sections of lawn violently flinging the mower forward to the arms’ extent followed by yanking it backward to reposition for the next violent fling with the end result resembling separate battlefields full of dismembered grass and weeds and whatever is left of blooms that may have established an outpost beyond the original bed.    As you might imagine such savage operation of the lawn mower over time causes problems and not just to the brutalized lawn. So today Hubby A.t.A. brought in the upper half of the mower’s handle and grips which had finally separated from the rest of the mower releasing the lawnmower’s spirit to the Great Garden Beyond. “This just came off” he says. “We need a new mower.”    Luckily the home improvement store had mower clones in stock and while we were out for the replacement Hubby A.t.A. announced a need for ten tarps with a plan to smother weeds growing into our own backyard from the neighbor’s yard because Hubby doesn’t want to spend hours pulling them and because the neighbor deliberately ignores the problem on his own side of the fence. As Conspiracy Theories go this one is at least plausible and doesn’t involve the consumption of toddlers. And as I’ve learned there’s no talking the Across the Aisle Caucus out of some of these proposals anyway — so I acquiesced to this legislative proposal in order to exact future funding for projects of my own later.    But the Backyard Garden is now operating with a Deficit Budget.
