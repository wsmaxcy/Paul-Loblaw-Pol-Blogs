L, I'm melting! Melting! Oh what a world! What a world!, Aldous J Pennyfarthing, 2021-06-27, Last night was one of the steamiest nights of my life and I don’t mean that in a good way. Here in Eugene Oregon yesterday’s high was 103 degrees. Fahrenheit. Though if you’d told me Celsius I might have believed you. After such a sultry day—again I don’t mean that in a good way—you might expect one to be eager for the relief that typically arrives on the morrow. But The Weather Channel’s website is currently predicting a high of 111 for today. Fuck you Weather Channel. Can’t you spoon-feed me soothing pabulum like Fox Newsmax and OAN do for their viewers? I only wish I could cut open a tauntaun with my lightsaber so I could sleep in it tonight. It would be much much cooler. This shit isn’t normal. There’s a reason so few people in the Pacific Northwest have air conditioning. We live in a pretty temperate area. Or used to anyway. Here’s a summary of Eugene’s typical June weather from weatherspark.com: Average Weather in June in Eugene Oregon United States Daily high temperatures increase by 8°F from 71°F to 79°F rarely falling below 61°F or exceeding 90°F. Daily low temperatures increase by 4°F from 48°F to 52°F rarely falling below 42°F or exceeding 58°F. For reference on August 3 the hottest day of the year temperatures in Eugene typically range from 55°F to 86°F while on December 23 the coldest day of the year they range from 35°F to 46°F. Normally I’d find a source that isn’t called “weatherspark.com” but my laptop is about to fuse to my groin so I have to make this as quick as possible. Is this a result of climate change? Well it’s impossible to tie specific weather events to large-scale changes in the climate. I roll my eyes when conservatives pooh-pooh climate change on cold days so I’m not going to automatically ascribe this heat wave to global warming. But damn the local weather—and the associated wildfires—have been concerning in the past few years. We moved to Oregon in 2015 assuming the weather would generally be mild. We’ve had some hella hot days since moving and last year’s big September wildfires were a real hardship for area residents. Is this the new normal? I hope not but I’m starting to think it is. As pedestrian bridges and buildings collapse elsewhere and a puddle of flop sweat pools beneath me my thoughts turn to infrastructure. Do we want lots more hot concrete beckoning more greenhouse gas-spewing vehicles or do we want to actually green our economy? I know how I’d vote. Joe Manchin? Kyrsten Sinema? Your turn to step up. Meanwhile we hardy Pacific Northwesterners will get through this. I only wish we didn’t have to.  Oh and I’d ask you to send me tots and pears but there’s no way I’m turning on the oven. Pears only. Please.  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter that is). What is it?
