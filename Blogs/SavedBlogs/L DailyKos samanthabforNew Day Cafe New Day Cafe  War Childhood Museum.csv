L, New Day Cafe:  War Childhood Museum, samanthabforNew Day Cafe, 2021-07-01,  The War Childhood Museum was founded to remember the experiences of children in the 1990’s-era Bosnian War. The goal was to collect objects that had helped children endure an incredibly stressful time.  The War Childhood Museum's collection includes books toys stuffed animals backpacks improvised games drawings and documents. Every object tells a story. https://t.co/15EU08c9a3  From an NYT piece on the museum  “The museum has collected more than 4000 objects from all over the world: Its collection includes items from the recent wars in Afghanistan Iraq Syria and Eritrea and even from World War II. The items don’t need to be expensive or rare — they only need to be important reminders of life in conflict. People donate books toys stuffed animals backpacks improvised games drawings and documents… The War Childhood Museum grew out of an idea its director Jasminko Halilovic had in 2010 he recalled recently in an interview in Kyiv. Over coffees and drinks in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo which was besieged for more than three years during the war his friends sometimes shared absurd funny and often painful memories from their wartime childhoods he said… ‘In Japan meeting 85-year-olds who were children during World War II and completely identified with the experience of a Bosnian child in the 1990s I realized that there are no borders to this shared experience’ he said. This epiphany combined with a realization that so many childhood memories were connected to objects became the idea for the museum he said: It opened in January 2017 and won the Council of Europe Museum Prize the following year.” Some examples:   Grab a cup of coffee a treat and share what’s on your mind this morning.
