L, Oregon Legislators Expel Rep. Who Guided Armed Protesters Into Capitol, Ed Scarce, 2021-06-11, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  You probably remember this guy as the one who not only let armed protesters into the Oregon Capitol building but gave them a lecture on how to breach security. Video shows him personally letting the protesters in as security struggles to push them back outside. Well for all his trouble Nearman just got himself expelled and stil faces criminal charges which could net him jail time. Nearman had refused to resign the lone vote against expulsion was himself. Source: Oregon Live The Oregon House voted 59-1 Thursday to expel Rep. Mike Nearman the first time it has ejected a sitting representative. Lawmakers removed Nearman because he let far-right demonstrators some of whom were armed into the Capitol on Dec. 21 while lawmakers were holding a special session. The Capitol was closed to the public due to the pandemic and remains so. That means his seat representing a rural district west of Salem will likely sit vacant for the remainder of the legislative session which must wrap up by June 27. BREAKING: Oregon lawmakers vote to expel Rep. Mike Nearman who helped far-right agitators gain entrance into the Oregon state Capitol in December. The expulsion vote was 59-1. Nearman himself was the only “no.” Finally some accountability.pic.twitter.com/T4kEqSBFt4 — Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) June 11 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
