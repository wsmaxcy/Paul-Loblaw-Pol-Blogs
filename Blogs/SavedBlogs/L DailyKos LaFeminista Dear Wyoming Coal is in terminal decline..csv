L, Dear Wyoming: Coal is in terminal decline., LaFeminista, 2021-05-10, Republican governor says measure sends message that Wyoming is ‘prepared to bring litigation to protect her interests’ Coal is a 19th century fuel in a 21st century world. It is out of date and filthiest of fossil fuels. Modernize for god’s sake. Wasting money to protect a vanishing industry makes no sense at all. You have a great potential from power generation (883 million MWh/yr)  from wind and solar (72 million MWh/yr) and as a State you only use about 12 million MWh/yr. That 12 million MWh/yr could be supplied for free in State. Coal  only employs 4500 people in Wyoming. Do you want to be an economic leader? Or be stuck in a disappearing past?
