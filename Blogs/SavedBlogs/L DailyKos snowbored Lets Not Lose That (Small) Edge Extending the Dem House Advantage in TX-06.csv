L, Let's Not Lose That (Small) Edge: Extending the Dem House Advantage in TX-06, snowbored, 2021-04-27, Last Saturday Democrats in the House gained a seat in the House with its special election in Louisiana CD-02.  This Saturday the special election in Texas' CD-06 could theoretically return that advantage back to a mere six seats.  Like Louisiana the Texas special is a jungle primary where a winner has to receive a majority of votes cast to be certified as won.  Otherwise a runoff is required between the top two vote getters. Hope Springs from Field PAC is doing GOTV canvassing in the TX-06 special election to fill the Wright vacancy.  We are knocking on the doors of Democrats and Independents who have voted in recent Democratic primaries asking them to vote in Saturday's election.  We are not endorsing a candidate merely urging Democrats to vote so that 1.) we force a runoff and 2.) that the second candidate is a Democrat.  Early voting began on April 19 and ends today (April 27th).  For those who requested (and received) a Ballot by Mail we are reminding them that their ballot has to be received by Saturday May 1 2021 at 7:00 p.m. to count. This is a now a majority minority district in the Ft. Worth metro area previously held by a Republican. It has changed significantly since the last census and has rather high mobility even for a Texas Congressional District. 84% of voters are in suburban Tarrant County and Tarrant County went for Joe Biden and Beto O’Rourke in the last two cycles.  It is above average in educational attainment so it is the kind of district that Democrats find promising — but this is Texas.  Democrats keep looking for a breakthrough and as much as we keep knocking on the door it hasn’t come yet. Yet.  But it can. Like all districts where Democrats have changed the hue you just have to keep pounding away.  This district fits the bill of districts that have turned from Red to Blue.   And there is victory in forcing a runoff with a Democrat being the second candidate.  (Susan Wright the widow of the former Congressman is widely considered the front-runner in this race.)  The longer we extend this race the longer Democrats have an extra seat in the House.  It's brutal math. Hope Springs from Field PAC is knocking on doors in the TX-06 special election.  We are focused on the ground the face to face conversations that have proven effective in turning out voters year in and year out.  By knocking on doors and delivering a hopeful clear message we want to increase Democratic turnout significantly and force a runoff between a Republican (probably the incumbent's widow) and a Democrat. Obviously we need your help.  We are raising money for field organizers and their tools (for example access to VoteBuilder).  If you support field/grassroots organizing we would certainly appreciate your support: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tx-06field Hope Springs from Field PAC was started by former Obama Field Organizers because field was the cornerstone of our success.  The approach we adopted was focused on listening on connecting voters and their story to the candidate.  Face to face interactions even masked and socially distanced are critical.  And we are among those Democrats who believe that we didn’t do as well in the 2020 Congressional races as expected because we didn’t knock on doors.  In areas like Texas it is even more crucial since many Democratic voters feel isolated even surrounded and are often unaware of the fact that their neighbors and colleagues are Democrats too! We aren't looking for moral victories here.  Even if Susan Wright wins a runoff the delay means she won't be seated until right before summer recess (if the pundits are right and Gov. Abbott names a July date for the runoff).  Lots of important votes in the U.S. House before that. It is even more important because we lost Democratic seats in the House because we respected our voters and neglected field organizing out of that concern in 2020.  We have to make up the field work we didn't do then -- registering voters re-registering voters at their current address and reminding them that Democrats care about their health and welfare.  In the latter regard Beto O’Rourke has been doing yeoman's work especially after the winter power outages that effected millions of Texans.  We have to keep that message alive before and in the minds of Texan voters. This (understandable) neglect means that we lost Institutional Knowledge with regards to field organizing.  A whole class of Democratic organizers have gone through an election where digital work was asked to make up for the lack of voter contact on the ground.  We learned in 2020 that digital contact and phone banks alone (while the other side is out knocking on doors) isn't enough in the swingiest of districts (eg Florida and Texas).  That's why we have such a narrow margin in the House.  The lack of faces at the door is even more critical in districts like TX-06 where people don't know that they have neighbors who vote Democratic.  I can't even remember all the times when I've shown voters the walk sheets to prove to them that they have Democrats on their street. Even as we climb the hill trying to paint a red seat blue we are laying the groundwork for being more competitive in Texas after Redistricting.  Indeed we are giving Texas state legislators something to think about in the expected Remap special session.  The better that Democrats do in this special election the more likely that Texas Republicans will try to protect their incumbents in Congress rather than redistrict in a way that adds to their margins.  Moreover: The provision in the Texas Constitution means that even if the Legislature meeting in special session drew new state legislative lines in 2021 it would have to repeat the process when it convenes in regular session in 2023 said Eric Opiela an election lawyer and former executive director and associate general counsel to the Texas Republican Party with long experience in redistricting. That means that Democrats who have made flipping the Texas House the centerpiece of their 2020 campaign “might have two bites at the apple” — the 2020 and 2022 elections — to gain control of the House in time for the last word on redistricting he said. We need Republicans in Texas to be afraid of losing incumbents in Congress.  For once Democrats gain an advantage in delay.  That’s not normal but this is Texas. Finally we can't overlook the crazy.  Tarrant County where Hope Springs from Field PAC has concentrated its canvassing efforts is becoming more and more Democratic.  And our efforts in the field confirms that.  We are definitely finding Biden Republicans voters who might have been one-off never-Trumpers if Trump wasn't doing his best to keep control of the Republican party.  Last weekend several houses we knocked on were sitting on the fence not knowing if they would vote for the deceased incumbent's widow or a Democrat in the race.  Our walk lists are primarily Democrats but also people who voted in Democratic primaries including the 2020 presidential Democratic primary.  Trump's erratic behavior benefits us with these voters.  And canvassers who are taught that a good impression is the most important thing they can leave with voters who are asking voters at their door "What Issue do you believe is most urgent facing our country at this time?" and "If you could send one message to your Member of Congress what would it be?" in addition to reminding them to vote in the special election this Saturday give these "former" Republicans a reason to stay in the Democratic voter file. We are building towards our Summer Homework where we try to make up for our careful 2020 field efforts.  This special election gives us a head start in the Ft. Worth area.  But we need your help.  If you would like to support our efforts to increase Democratic turnout in the May 1st special election and force a runoff please do: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tx-06field
