L, Republican Omega Point: the Big Lie, Gaurang, 2021-05-10, The Big Lie is aptly named as it takes all of the smaller lies told by Republicans over the past 50 years  and rolls them together into the One Lie to Rule Them All the one that can end our democracy which always has been the goal of all their lying small and big. All they ever needed was the Big Lie but it took the smaller lies told over and over and over again to get to the point that enough Americans having been lied to incessantly for a lifetime would actually accept that it’s impossible for Republicans to lose elections. Republicans always lie because they have nothing to tell the truth about. They have no accomplishments no ideas no visions. They have no hope to offer anyone in need no empathy or compassion for anyone suffering. They are not American patriots upholders of family family values loving Christians public servants fighting for the people fiscally responsible job creators believers in law and order. They are liars. Liars who must now tell the Big Lie over and over and over again until democracy falls and the liars rule. Or fail.
