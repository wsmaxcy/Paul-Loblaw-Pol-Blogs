L, Fort Missoula: Homestead cabin (photo diary), OjibwaforMuseums, 2021-07-07, Fort Missoula was established as a military post near Missoula Montana in 1877 and in 1975 the Historical Museum at Fort Missoula (HMFM) was founded. Today the Museum exhibits are located in the Quartermaster’s Storehouse and the Museum’s 32-acre park contains a number of historic buildings. The Hayes Homestead Cabin was built about 1900 and was brought to the Museum’s park in 1974. The cabin is bunkhouse style and was originally located in the Potomac Valley east of Missoula. According to the display: “The logs are notched and laid horizontally with chinking and daubing applied in order to make it weather proof. It is larger than most cabins of the Homestead era which were designated by law to be at least 10’ by 12’ with one window and one door.”            Milling wheat into flour was an important activity is early Missoula. The Frenchtown Mill Stones originally made about 1862 were used by the Frenchtown Flouring Mill to grind wheat which could then be sold to Missoula businesses. According to the display: “The bed stone (bottom) is stationary; the runner (top) was turned in a circular manner and grain was hand-fed through the hole in the runner stone. Our bed stone is basalt while the runner stone is French Burr. The bed stone could be raised or lowered to produce coarse or fine meal. The lower surfaces of both stones are grooved or furrowed in a pattern that caused meal to flow away from the center of the two stones to the outer edges or skirts. The layout of furrowsf is referred to as the ‘dress’. Both stones are dressed alike so when in a working position with both grinding faces together they cross to create a  positive shearing action like many pairs of scissors in action.” Fort Missoula: One-room schoolhouse (photo diary) Museums 101: The Nevada City China Town (Photo Diary) Museums 101: A Homesteader's Shack a Blacksmith Shop and a Paint Store (Photo Diary) Museums 101: The General Store (Photo Diary) Museums 101: A Trapper's Cabin (Photo Diary) Museums 101: The Whalen Homestead Cabin (Photo Diary) Museums 101: Homestead Cabin and Barn (Photo Diary) Museums 101: The Big House at Fort Vancouver (Photo Diary)
