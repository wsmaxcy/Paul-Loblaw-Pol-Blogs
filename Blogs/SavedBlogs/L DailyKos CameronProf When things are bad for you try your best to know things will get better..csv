L, When things are bad for you try your best to know things will get better., CameronProf, 2021-04-27, Pardon me for the Theistic tinge to the diary. If you deeply have a difficulty with reading the personal problems/solutions for theistic folk this is not the place for you and I am sure a diary better suited might be one or two down.  Ok.  As some of you know or might know I am a 52 cat loving theistic guy in a nursing home. I am unattractive I am basically lonely 24/7 so I try to find joys where I can get them.  People often ask me why I ask the diaries that I do you know “What is your favorite….” “What experience was tehe most...” I do it because I get a lot out of it. It seems that many of these topics bring joy to people their memories etc. so I live vicariously. It also seems to make us less like strangers who share common political traits but like actual friends and who can have too many friends?  When things for me get tough like they are now….financially and I realize that basically I am in a nursing home for life unless a miracle happens so I am limited in what I can do. I worked a great job which I loved because it helped people with their health for a Fortune 20 company so I made a decent wage I had many friends and 15 years later here I am….along without much of a future.  So I make up for it. I live vicariously. I hear and see people with cats and it makes my depression about having to give mine up a little less. I hear your favorite music and even if I do not like the tune I know you do and I take that as a cool thing.  So if something is bothering you and you feel down always try your best to know that someone out there cares. For me it is G-d and my online friends. Without either I’d have given up long ago.  Please know there are people out there for you…..even if it is an ugly catless young coot stuck in a nursing home.
