L, National Archives' racism task force says..., friedbones, 2021-06-27, I’ve been a history buff all my life.  Fortunately many of my mentors were so diverse that what they had to suggest I look into made perfect sense since it was not colored by any particular bias.  Although all humans have inherent biases I do believe we have the ability to rise above those perceptions to look at other ideas and experiences more objectively rather than subjectively.  This article I am linking seems on the surface to be such an effort except that there are some ‘suggestions’ that its a bad thing to look at the truth of matters rather than their sources.  However I caution anyone reading this article to keep in mind the source is well known for their ability to twist even the most benign subject into the worst kind of report….sans real details about the truth. The National Archives' task force on racism claimed in a little-noticed report to the U.S.’s top librarian that the Archives' own Rotunda – which houses the Declaration of Independence the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights – is an example of "structural racism" and that the Founding Fathers and other White historically impactful Americans are portrayed too positively. www.foxnews.com/... Foxnews in my opinion is not an unbiased organization but a propaganda resource for twisting what could be a very interesting and informative report into something so flagrantly biased its ridiculous.  As some commentators very succinctly put it:  Poster #1:  As a child I enjoyed looking at the nation's historical pictures. Now as an adult I understand the significance this nation's history has afforded to many around the world. Though far from perfect I am ever so grateful my ancestors chose to come to this great nation. Had we stayed in their homeland our family would have surely perished. So it is with heartfelt gratitude that I understand the past and march toward to future.  Poster in response to #1: Yes.   People today realize that our country was not founded under perfect circumstances but had the beginnings of something great and is continually evolving.   Visiting historic places most people take this into consideration.  Many of our founders of all backgrounds should be valorized and protected. But to continually dig for any and every kind of slight constantly self-flagellating while still living in this country is silly and hypocritical.   History cannot be changed only made.   People grow a spine and call on your sense of inner strength when confronted with challenges.  Among the posters there are a lot of negatives as well which I choose not to include because I understand that mankind is not always kind….but can be cruel as well.  There are reasons on both sides of the issue that truly need to be examined being skeptical is a very good reason for more research and examination to find the truth. I do not find reason in skewing the findings to a particular theme that is more at home in a toxic arena than genuine interest in finding the truth no matter how uncomfortable that truth really is.  However it is worthwhile to point out that even bad actors can actually be the source for a positive outcome albeit an unintended consequence of their own actions.
