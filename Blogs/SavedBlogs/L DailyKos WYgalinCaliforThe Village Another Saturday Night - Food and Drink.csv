L, Another Saturday Night - Food and Drink, WYgalinCaliforThe Village, 2021-07-03, Good evening everybody and welcome to another Saturday night of music memories and conversations.  When I set out to write this weeks diary I tapped my daughter for help.  I told her all I  could think about was food (it was close to snack time if I remember correctly).  She replied “There’s quite a few songs that mention food and drink — in the title or in the song itself.”  That’s how this diary came about. Also this weekend we celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence and if you’re like most of us you celebrate with food and drink.  Lots of food and drink.  GENTLE REMINDER:  Please remember to identify your song and artist in your comment for those of us using mobile sites.  It’s very much appreciated.  I am going to start us out with a classic — American Pie  . Followed by some Rolling Stones —  Brown Sugar.   . You know how this works — Put your quarter in the slot and your song in the comments.  This is your Saturday night jukebox and the party starts NOW.
