L, What we are up against and what we can do: Saturday's GNR, GoodNewsRoundup, 2021-05-01, In between college and graduate school I spent some time working retail at one of the least ethical stores anywhere.  There was a huge amount of pressure to sell overpriced and useless skin care products and pretty blatant pressure to do so with little concern for the truth.   One day I sold a lady some cleanser and a mesh sponge she could use to apply the cleanser.  If memory serves (and it usually doesn’t) the sponge was $9.  A little while later she came back to the store and told me that she found a sponge that looked exactly the same at a store upstairs for $1.  She asked me to explain to her why she shouldn’t return our sponge and buy the cheaper one. I’d like to tell you here that I told her to go ahead and get the cheaper sponge.  I’d like to tell you that I whispered to her that she and I could work together to stick it to the man.   But I didn’t.  Instead I told her how our sponge had been developed especially to have materials and spacing that was exactly the right size and texture to exfoliate the skin perfectly.  I told her that although they might look the same our sponge had scientifically developed properties that were great for her skin.  She thanked me and kept our $9 sponge. I lied.  I made up every word of that to get her to keep our sponge.  Every. Word.  My goal was “I don’t want to lose this sale and mess up my numbers” so to get to that goal I said exactly what I thought would convince her without even giving one second of thought to (a) what the truth was and (b) what was actually best for her.  And I did it without feeling any remorse (at the time) or any concern or any thought to doing what was right.  I had a goal and lying to someone was the best way to get there and I did it. I am not proud of this story.  And it only makes me feel slightly better to remember that this (along with a number of other factors) was why I decided to leave retail and go back to school.   I am telling you this shameful story about my youthful behavior because it occurred to me that the entire Republican party is me at that skin care store.  One of the grossest moments of my life is how an entire party operates every single day.  The moment that will forever haunt me is their day to day.  There is zero thought for truth.  There is zero regard for the wellbeing of those they serve.  All that matters is getting to the end goal (power).  The path is of no concern.  Sure there are still Republicans like Mitt Romney out there.  But he is the exception that proves the rule.  The fact that someone acting like ethics matter (just a little) makes them stand out like a sore thumb proves our point. The rest of the right wing is lying about burgers and books and anything they can think of to trick people into voting for them.  They have no interest in actually governing.  They have no desire to make things better.  And they have no ethical code keeping them from lying and cheating.  They have an end goal and any path that will get them there is ok. When Biden talks about the battle between democracy and autocracy he is not just talking about this on a world stage.  He is talking about it happening right here in the USA.  The Republican party no longer values democracy.  The Republican party no longer cares about the success of America or Americans.  The Republican party no longer has any code at all other than power for themselves. We won gigantic battles in 2018 and 2020.  But many big battles remain.  We have to celebrate our victories and allow them to rededicate us to the continued fight for our nation. Luckily great things are happening.  Democrats are doing what is necessary to show Americans that doing the right thing for all Americans is the right thing for all Americans. Nothing will help us win more than a roaring economy going into 2022.  We can show that caring about the American people actually helps the American people. Government *of the people and by the people* is a real thing.  It can work.  The U.S. economic recovery picked up speed with the economy growing 1.6 percent in the first three months of the year because of rising coronavirus vaccinations and massive federal stimulus spending. The economy is on the verge of regaining all of its pandemic losses in coming months. The GDP report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday showed that consumers are spending more on things like cars and homes. Plus a record boost in household after-tax income suggests there’s more consumer spending power waiting in the wings. Shopping And Shots Power An Economy Heading To Its Fastest Growth Since 1984  The U.S. economy expanded at a rapid pace in the first three months of the year setting the stage for what's expected to be the strongest annual growth in nearly four decades. According to the Commerce Department the economy grew at an annual rate of 6.4% between January and March as millions of Americans got vaccinated against COVID-19 and the federal government spent trillions of dollars to counteract the effects of the pandemic recession. Biden at 100 days: Hottest stock market since JFK  The Biden bust that the Trump campaign warned of has morphed into a Biden boom.  The stock market closed out President Biden’s first 100 days in office on Thursday with its best start to a presidential term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The S&P 500 has risen 11% since Mr. Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The index recorded its strongest performance since the start of Mr. Roosevelt’s first term in 1933 when it surged 80% after a spectacular crash in the Great Depression according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis. By comparison the S&P 500 rose 5.3% in the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s term in early 2017 and on average has gained 3.2% over that period in presidential terms since Herbert Hoover’s in 1929. Jobless claims hit new pandemic low for third straight week as labor market picks up  Weekly jobless claims fell to a pandemic low for the third consecutive week the Labor Department reported Thursday with 553000 Americans filing for initial unemployment benefits for the week that ended April 24. This marks a decrease of 13000 compared with the previous week putting the insured unemployment rate around 2.6 percent the Labor Department said. While claims remain elevated the trajectory signals that growing vaccination numbers loosening business restrictions and warmer weather are helping to heal the jobs market. The streak of declining claims started in mid-April with a surprise drop of more than 175000. Now economists say they think the trend will continue.  Biden's economic push tests the power of pocketbook issues to sway America's polarized electorate Good Luck to Republicans if Biden’s Family Plan Becomes Law  Conservatives beware: If the main elements in Joe Biden’s American Family Plan become law they’ll be very hard to repeal. Why? Because they’ll deliver huge indeed transformational benefits to millions. I mean just imagine trying to take away affordable child care universal pre-K and paid leave for new parents once they’ve become part of the fabric of our society. You’d face a backlash far worse than the one that followed Republican attempts to eliminate protection for coverage of pre-existing health conditions in 2017. And that backlash quickly gave Democrats control of the House and set the stage for their current control of the Senate and White House as well. Meanwhile the republicans are not exactly paying 4th dimensional chess. Biden’s big-spending agenda brought to you by the Trump era Americans are more in favor of government solving problems than at any point in nearly three decades polling shows. A big increase came during Trump’s years Trump paved the way for Biden’s ambitious agenda by making the GOP revolve around him rather than any preexisting policy goals or defined ideology.  An NBC News poll released this week showed 55 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that the government should do more to solve problems and meet the needs of people compared with 41 percent that said it was doing too much. Five of the six most pro-big government responses on this poll question? All in the past four years since Trump took office. And that’s in data stretching back to the mid-1990s when President Bill Clinton decided he needed to emphasize that he wasn’t some kind of big-government liberal. Republicans are raising self-sabotage to an art form When the 2020 Census numbers were released it was an open question as to whether the Republican effort to insert a citizenship question into the census had hampered counting in three red states with large Hispanic populations. Many number-crunchers expected Arizona to gain one seat Florida to gain two and Texas to gain three; instead Arizona stayed even Florida gained one seat and Texas gained two. It turns out Republicans may have undercut their own census counts and it was not simply a result of the failed gambit to insert a citizenship question. As former Obama administration speechwriter David Litt writes in Democracy Docket: “In places like Texas Florida and Arizona many local and statewide officials supported the Trump Administration’s unconstitutional attempt to add a citizenship question to the census even though the people most likely to be deterred by such a question live disproportionately in those states.” He also noted that the “Florida GOP underfunded census outreach” and that “[Texas’s] outreach campaign operated on what the New York Times described as ‘a shoestring.’” The most remarkable finding was this: “even before the pandemic hit 24 states were not planning to spend a single dime of their own money encouraging residents to sign up — and 17 of those 24 states were run entirely by Republican politicians.”  'A lot of confusion': Virginia Republicans stumble over their own voter ID requirement “It's 'Lord of the Flies' in the Virginia GOP right now” said former Republican Congressman Denver Riggleman who lost a state Republican convention last year that he and allies felt was rigged against him after he came under criticism because he officiated a same-sex wedding. "It's all very ironic." “There's still a lot of confusion among the everyday Republican voter” said Tim Parrish the chairman of the Prince William County GOP. "I probably get about 100 questions no exaggeration a day."  In a contrast in simplicity Virginia Democrats will go to the polls on June 8 and simply elect a nominee in a primary. Their voters will have to provide a government-issued ID as required by state law. Republicans however opted to hold a convention — a decision in part because Virginia voters don't register with a party so primaries are open and the GOP has long argued Democrats were voting in their contests to try to disrupt their elections. Political engagement by young Americans has surged to an historic high and that's bad news for the GOP.A dozen years ago 24% of Americans under 30 said they were politically active.Today that number is 36%.For young Black Americans it's 41%. https://t.co/yKgzLB6VH6  Number of children held in Border Patrol facilities drops 84% since peak last month The number of unaccompanied migrant children held in jail-like conditions by US Customs and Border Protection dropped nearly 84% in the span of a month according to a White House official underscoring the significant progress made by the administration after reaching record high custody figure Biden allies launch voting rights initiative  An outside political group formed by allies of President Joe Biden is launching a voting rights initiative focused on strengthening pro-voter policies and protecting against suppression efforts. The nonprofit Building Back Together announced the project Wednesday saying in a release that the group “will work to counter proposed changes to those laws that impede access particularly for voters of color and historically disadvantaged and densely populated communities.” The group will focus first on a slew of battleground states some of which have implemented laws that voting rights advocates say seek to prevent people from casting ballots. The states include Arizona Georgia Florida Michigan New Hampshire North Carolina Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin. U.S. coronavirus cases drop as spring wave of infections ebbs The spring wave of coronavirus infections that began in March is subsiding in most of the country with 42 states and D.C. reporting lower caseloads for the past two weeks. Hospitals in hard-hit Michigan and other Upper Midwest states that were flooded with patients in mid-April are discharging more than they’re admitting. The daily average of new infections nationwide has dropped to the lowest level since mid-October. Many cities are rapidly reopening after 14 months of restrictions. The mayor of virus-ravaged New York City Bill de Blasio (D) said he plans to have the city fully open by July 1. Supreme Court sides with undocumented immigrant fighting deportation  The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant seeking to challenge his removal from the U.S. by immigration authorities. In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch the court said the Justice Department was violating federal law by not providing immigrants it seeks to deport with a single comprehensive "notice to appear" with details on the charges and scheduled court appearance. "If men must turn square corners when they deal with the government it cannot be too much to expect the government to turn square corners when it deals with them" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion joined by a remarkable alignment of justices -- Clarence Thomas Stephen Breyer Sonia Sotomayor Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett.
