L, Will Trump's Attempt At A Comeback Help Dems In The Midterms?, Steve M., 2021-05-16, For a while it looked as if Donald Trump would spend his post-presidential days as a greeter at Mar-a-Lago -- he was off social media he hadn't found a way to communicate  regularly with the public and he wasn't doing the rallies that were his  favorite form of self-aggrandizement.  But now he's back online (after a fashion) he's been receiving supplicants -- and according to the Daily Mail he's planning rallies again:  Former President Trump will hold two rallies in June as he  looks to capitalize on a series of crises engulfing President Joe Biden  and lay down a marker for 2024 according to an adviser familiar with  planning.  Those will be followed by a third event around July 3....  Factors under consideration are whether to appear at events with  candidates that he has already endorsed or whether to travel to  locations that reflect a specific campaign topic.  Trump has also teased the idea of visiting the border....  I don't want him back. I don't miss having that whining grating  hectoring voice in my ears every day.  But Trump's return if it  happens might be good for us.  We know that President Biden is popular  -- but Biden's popularity doesn't seem likely to preserve the  Democratic majority in the House and effective majority in the Senate.  The party out of power generally does well in a president's first  midterms. Some observers believe that Republicans could take the House  back based on their likely redistricting gains alone. And "generic ballot" polling points to Republican gains. New election laws in Republican-controlled states will hurt Democrats too.  Democrats win the presidency when voters are fed up with Republicans --  but Democratic voters tend to relax after electing a  president. They  forget what they were angry about. It happened in 1994 and 2010.  Which is why Trump's comeback might be a good thing. The only good  midterm election a Democratic president has had in the past thirty years  was in 1998 when Democratic voters had a clear and present enemy: Newt  Gingrich's merry band of impeachers. Next year Marjorie Taylor Greene  and Matt Gaetz might not be enough -- the politically engaged know who  they are but other Democratic voters might need more motivation to turn  out. Trump might provide that motivation.  We know Trump's popularity is fading:  The Washington Post reported over the weekend on a Republican retreat held last month that featured a polling briefing for GOP members.  When staff from the National Republican Congressional  Committee rose to explain the party's latest polling in core  battleground districts they left out a key finding about Trump's  weakness declining to divulge the information even when directly  questioned about Trump's support by a member of Congress according to  two people familiar with what transpired. Trump's unfavorable ratings  were 15 points higher than his favorable ones in the core districts  according to the full polling results which were later obtained by The  Washington Post.  In these battleground districts "strongly unfavorable" views of the  former president were twice as high as "strongly favorable" views.  Trump's numbers might rise if he emerges from hiding as GOP voters  recall why they first fell in love. But many of these voters didn't turn  out to vote in 2018 because they didn't think it was worth the trouble  if their God Emperor wasn't on the ballot. And he may have thoroughly  alienated a small but significant sliver of the GOP electorate who  won't respond to his ranting (which will be more unhinged than ever).  So it might be good to have him out there. It might be good to have im  back on Twitter Facebook and YouTube. Less engaged Democratic voters  might not vote unless they're voting against him.
