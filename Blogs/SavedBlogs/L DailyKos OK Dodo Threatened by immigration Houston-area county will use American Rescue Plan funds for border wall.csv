L, Threatened by immigration Houston-area county will use American Rescue Plan funds for border wall, OK Dodo, 2021-06-29, On Tuesday Galveston County Texas judge Mark Henry has made a Declaration Of Local State of Disaster which involves an increasing influx of immigrants entering the county through the Texas-Mexico border. WHEREAS the public health and safety of the residents of Galveston County are under imminent threat from the influx of foreign nationals unlawfully crossing the Texas-Mexico border. The ongoing border crisis has resulted in thousands of undocumented noncitizens entering the State of Texas and Galveston County; (...)  Henry has stated that the border crossings have threatened public health and safety. (Although one must note that he is against any mask mandates and numerous COVID-related restrictions even if they are imposed by Texas governor Greg Abbott himself. But Henry has yet to made a public statement when it comes to the permitless carry bill passed by Abbott.) WHEREAS the public health threat comes from the flow of illegal drugs in our communities and region causing addictions dependencies and overdoses; the associated violence resulting from gang and drug activities in our communities and region; the influx of human and sex trafficking in our communities and region; and the elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases including foreign variants of COVID-19 HIV tuberculosis influenza mumps measles rubella and polio without testing and health regulation of the persons illegally entering our communities and region from nations with higher rates of infection of such diseases; (...)  Because of numerous concerns over the border Mark Henry has announced that Galveston County will assist Texas Governor Greg Abbott when it comes to the border crisis. With funds from the American Rescue Plan which was passed to provide comprehensive COVID-19 relief Galveston County will provide $6.6 million for the construction of the border wall which is about 10 per cent of the funds that the American Rescue Plan allocated to Galveston County. The county will also coordinate with the state Department of Public Safety on the border. "We have seen an increase in violent and organized crime" Henry said. "We had a federal task force down here a few weeks ago serving warrants. We have seen an increased flow of drugs. We have had drugs wash up on the beach in Galveston County." Henry provided no specific information of increased violent crime tied to illegal immigration in the county. The judge said just 28 out of nearly 1000 inmates are undocumented. He also claims the rise in illegal crossings poses a health threat to the county.  Galveston County is not the only county concerned with the Texas-Mexico border. In fact Montgomery County another Houston-area county that includes places such as Conroe and The Woodlands will also provide assistance and coordination on the border issue.  "The sheriff has answered the call to provide jailers" Montgomery County Judge Mark Keough said. "So they are going to move in the area of preferably just jailers. As this unfolds we'll be back."  Although the plan will not be finalized until this Friday afternoon this is not the first time that Galveston County had problems with immigrants. In 2014 League City the largest city in the county was one of the first cities if not the first to ban undocumented children refugee or otherwise from entering the city limits; Galveston County would shortly pass a similar ordinance countywide.
