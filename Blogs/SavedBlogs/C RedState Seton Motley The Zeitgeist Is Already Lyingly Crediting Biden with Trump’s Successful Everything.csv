C, The Zeitgeist Is Already Lyingly Crediting Biden with Trump’s Successful Everything, Seton Motley, 2020-12-14, In case you were wondering…: “Zeitgeist: The general intellectual moral and cultural climate of an era.” Today’s Zeitgeist is constituted mostly by Big Tech Big Media Big Entertainment and Big Business.  And they are all hardcore Leftist. When we say… We the Reasonable Are Outnumbered – and Massively Outgunned …we mean it. When the Zeitgeist can make a story magically disappear just before an election… How the Mainstream Media Big Tech Covered Up the Hunter Biden Story …only to make it magically reappear just after the election… Mainstream Media Big Tech Coverup Collapses with Hunter Biden Investigation …you have a SERIOUS national problem. DHS Chiefs: Tech Censorship Cancel Culture a National Security Threat The Zeitgeist is brazenly blatantly lying to US.  And it is having a SERIOUS deleterious effect on our nation. Democrat Researcher Robert Epstein: Google Shifted a ‘Minimum’ of Six Million Votes in 2020 The Stealing of the Presidency 2020: “The left-wing news media didn’t just poison the information environment with their incessantly negative coverage of President Trump going into the 2020 election. “They also refused to give airtime to important arguments of the Republican campaign — both pro-Trump and anti-Biden — which meant millions of voters cast their ballots knowing only what the media permitted them to know about the candidates…. “(T)he Media Research Center…tested…(swing state) voters’ knowledge of eight news stories — all important topics that our ongoing analysis had shown the liberal news media had failed to cover properly. “We found that a huge majority (82%) of Biden voters were unaware of at least one of these key items with five percent saying they were unaware of all eight of the issues we tested. “This lack of information proved crucial: One of every six Biden voters we surveyed (17%) said they would have abandoned the Democratic candidate had they known the facts about one or more of these news stories. “A shift of this magnitude would have changed the outcome in all six of the swing states won by Joe Biden and Donald Trump would have comfortably won a second term as president.” And despite ALL of that – Trump still won.  Until the post-Election Day heist by Biden Inc. Care to discuss that massive heist?  Too bad. Google’s YouTube to Censor All Claims of Election Fraud by Republicans Not Democrats Twitter and Facebook Label Posts with False Election Claims When a Republican miraculously manages to get elected President?  Good news he generates is credited by the Zeitgeist to his most recent Democrat predecessor.  And his accomplishments are lyingly subserviated to his most recent Democrat predecessor’s. Trump Makes One-Minute Appearance to Tout Dow’s 30000: “‘The stock market Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 30000 which is the highest in history. We’ve never broken 30000 and that’s despite everything that’s taken place with the pandemic’ (Trump) said.” But get this Zeitgeist titanic nonsense…. The S&P 500 Is at an All Time High—But Markets Still Performed Far Better Under Obama Than Trump No the markets simply did not. Trump promised a China Virus vaccine by the end of the year.  The Zeitgeist’s response? Trump’s Covid-19 Vaccine Timeline Is Seriously Wishful Thinking. Here’s Why Except Trump did it.  So the Zeitgeist blows past its past wrong reporting – and lyingly gives credit to the incoming Democrat successor they lyingly helped steal the election…oops I mean elect. Thank You Joe Biden for the Covid-19 Vaccine And allows said next nearest Democrat to lyingly take credit. Biden’s COVID Vaccine Plan: 100 Million Shots In 100 Days Ummm…Trump already pre-arranged that delivery. Trump Administration Buying Another 100 Million Doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine UPS and FedEx Set to Deliver COVID Vaccines Per (Trump) White House Mandate: “President of UPS Global Healthcare Wes Wheeler says UPS ‘spent months strategizing with Operation Warp Speed officials’ on how to best distribute the vaccine. “Wheeler also said the two companies will be working closely to divvy up states for the most efficient vaccine delivery.” Trump wisely started the global movement away from thieving totalitarian Communist China. Trump Announces Unprecedented Action Against China Prior to his arrival the US and Global Zeitgeists delusional-ly LOVED China. How China Turns Globalist Billionaires and Big Tech into Spokespeople China Isn’t an Existential Threat to the United States Why a Rising China Isn’t as Dangerous As Experts Make It Out to Be Biden Dismisses China’s Threat to US Again Because they have been making trillions of dollars off of Communist China. Chinese Academic Bragging About Influence in Washington Proves Why Tech Censorship Is A National Security Threat Facebook Twitter and Big Tech Make Their Money in China How WHO Became China’s Accomplice in the Coronavirus Pandemic The NBA’s Crisis in China Threatens Multibillion-Dollar Ties How Biden’s Son Got $1.5 Billion from China Except now thanks to Trump even the US and Global Zeitgeists are rethinking things. EU Proposes New Post-Trump Alliance with U.S. in Face of China Threat Or at least pretending to rethink things. China-Canada Joint Military Exercises Called Off After US Raises Concerns Trump pulls the anti-China trigger… Trump Declares National Emergency Bans Huawei ZTE And the world begins to follow suit. Japan to Ban Huawei ZTE from Govt Contracts As Britain Bans Huawei U.S. Pressure Mounts on Europe to Follow Suit And Trump’s righteous pressure is working. Trump Turning More Countries in Europe Against Huawei Huawei Challenges Legality of 5G Bans in Poland Romania And the Zeitgeist pretends all of it never happened.  Trump does the heavy lifting – and the Zeitgeist pretends the door Trump opened is just…open for Biden to waltz through. How Biden Could Galvanize the World Against Huawei Much like the with China Virus vaccine – Trump already did this. Speaking of Trump already doing something…behold the Internet in the Trump Era. Rural Broadband and C-Band Spectrum Auctions Cap Successful Run for (Trump) FCC’s Ajit Pai A Spectrum of Free-Market Success Successful?  Very very…. Coronavirus: Nation’s Internet Providers Have Made #SelfDistancing Telework a Piece of Cake China Virus Lockdown Proves US Internet is Better Stronger and Faster Than Europe’s China Virus Breaks Europe’s Internet – Not the US’s. Why? Uber-Regs Like Net Neutrality US Broadband Speeds Jumped 90% In 2020 But what of the Digital Divide?  The people who aren’t currently connected to the Internet? Trump understood the private sector was the way to close it. China Virus Shutdown Re-Proves: More Government Means Less Private Sector Competition Government Disproportionately Harms Poorer Americans More So Trump enacted a panoply of policies – to enable the private sector to close it. Trump Pledged to Close the Digital Divide. How Will He Do It? By getting rid of lots of stupid regulations.  At every government level. Trump’s FCC Chief Leaves Legacy of Deregulation and 5G Fights Trump’s FCC Officially Repeals Obama-Era Net Neutrality Laws Thanks to the Trump FCC for Limiting Local Government Shakedowns Trump also got the government to auction lots more wireless spectrum to the private sector.  More private sector spectrum – means more connectivity.  For everyone. Fifty-Seven Qualified Bidders for Spectrum Successful Rural Broadband Auction Will Bring Internet to Over 10 Million Americans Kaboom.  Digital Divide – slamming closed. What does Biden want to do?  A restoration of the same old same old huge government inanity. Biden’s Grand Plan for the Internet: Restore Net Neutrality Create Municipal Broadband All of which never ever works.  The Digital Divide – will get wider and wider. Net Neutrality Would Make the Internet More Expensive: “Robust broadband investment matters because it keeps the internet affordable…. “Today the average American adult spends over 40 hours per week online. If we paid 1995 rates for present-day usage the average bill would total $320 per month. And of course it would be dial-up not 4G LTE. “Unfortunately net neutrality led to decreased broadband investment. Since 2006 broadband investment has only decreased twice: in the depths of the Great Recession and after net neutrality was passed per statistics from the industry’s trade association.” And Biden can’t “create municipal broadband.”  Because government broadband has already existed for more than twenty years.  Guess how that’s gone? Broadband Boondoggles – Failed Taxpayer-Funded Networks: “For decades local governments have made promises of faster and cheaper broadband networks. Unfortunately these municipal networks often don’t deliver or fail leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. Explore the map to learn about the massive debt waste and broken promises left behind by these failed government networks.” To continue closing the Digital Divide – as Trump did?  We need more Trump Policy. More Internet and Access? We Need More Spectrum and Less Government Unfortunately we’re about to get the antithesis of what we need.  A whole lot of Biden Policy. We do know with metaphysical certitude that when Trump’s ten million new Internet users come online – the Zeitgeist will lyingly credit Biden. But the Zeitgeist’s lies can only obfuscate Reality. They can’t change it.
