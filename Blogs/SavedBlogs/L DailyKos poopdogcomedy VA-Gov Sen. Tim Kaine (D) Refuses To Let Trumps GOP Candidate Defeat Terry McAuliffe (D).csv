L, VA-Gov: Sen. Tim Kaine (D) Refuses To Let Trump's GOP Candidate Defeat Terry McAuliffe (D), poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-27, Received this e-mail yesterday from U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D. VA) in support of former Governor Terry McAuliffe’s (D. VA) gubernatorial campaign:  It’s hard to put into words just how important it is for Terry McAuliffe to win this November. His opponent Glenn Youngkin is a former private equity executive who said he’s willing to spend up to $75 million to buy the Governor’s office. And what's more Youngkin isn’t just endorsed by Donald Trump -- Glenn also says that Trump represents a lot of the reasons why he’s running. We can’t let Glenn Youngkin do to Virginia what Donald Trump did to our country. The best way for you to help right now is by pitching in right now before the end of June. Please donate any amount that’s meaningful to you and help Terry defeat Youngkin. In less than a week Terry’s team is facing their first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. This one is big because Glenn Youngkin keeps outraising Terry. We have to show Youngkin we have the grassroots strength to keep up. That’s why your support is so important. Election experts are calling Virginia one of the most important races in the country and with Glenn Youngkin running neck-and-neck in the polls with Terry it’s critical for us to come together so Terry doesn’t fall behind. Please contribute anything you can afford right now and help Terry reach his end-of-quarter goal. With your help I know we can defeat Trumpism in Virginia. Let’s send a clear message that Virginia is ready to fight for our positive and progressive future. Thank you Tim Click here to donate to McAuliffe’s campaign.
