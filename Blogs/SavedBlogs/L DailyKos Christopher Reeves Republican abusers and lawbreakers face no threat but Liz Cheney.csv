L, Republican abusers and lawbreakers face no threat but Liz Cheney?, Christopher Reeves, 2021-05-05, Republicans have had one of those years that put them in the back seat of a cop car after a high-speed chase or the wrong side of jail bars. And that's only in my own home state! Whether it’s killing a pedestrian for an attorney general or being accused of raping an intern Republicans have seen it all—and I haven’t even managed to discuss Matt Gaetz and his connection to sex trafficking or Rudy Guiliani. Then again I just don’t have a few years to go through the disaster the GQP has become.  Matt Gaetz hasn’t faced broad calls to be kicked out of the party. In Kansas both arrested Republicans including Mark Samsel arrested just last week for abuse of a student while offering homophobic slurs were still there in Topeka seated and voting on legislation Wednesday. Matt Gaetz? Still welcome in the club and invited to for-pay fundraising events. The intern in Idaho? Harrassed by elected Republicans who back their rapist colleague. All of those events? A-OK in the GQP. Not OK? Saying one bad word about Donald J. Trump. Trump is effectively forcing every Republican who wants a political future to show how far they're willing to compromise on principle truth and conscience for power. We’re watching the final collapse of the old GOP in real time.https://t.co/FeBUk0OVQ2 Trump’s push to choose me or else seems to be working within the Republican brand. Almost any and every sin can be completely forgiven as long as you stay true to the Trumpian agenda. That agenda is hard to completely nail down but a big part of it can be simplified to: all Democrats are bad I am perfect and any conservative or corporate sin can be forgiven. Even Donald Jr. is in on the act: CNN is wall to wall public relations & rapid response for their favorite warmonger Liz Cheney...Which tells you everything you need to know about her.Comical that a bunch of media Dems think they have any influence over who Republicans want representing them in leadership!!! I think it is important to note that Liz Cheney does not in any way make herself into a candidate or an elected official any Democrat admires or looks up to just based on her voting record. She’s been against DREAMERS against background checks voted against the HEROES Act and is not in favor of election reform.  Kevin McCarthy however is just concerned that she can’t carry out the party message. What is that message now? Does anyone really know? Is it promoting violence? Demanding attacks on others? Petty Twitter fights? Mowing down people in cars or endorsing laws that make it legal to do so? From CNN: McCarthy argued on Tuesday on Fox News that Cheney was a liability not because of her vote to impeach Trump but because she could no longer "carry out the message. We all need to be working as one if we're able to win the majority." People in Wyoming are prepared for Trump to endorse Anthony Bouchard in a Republican primary.  I would move that Liz Cheney be removed from her position of leadership. Can I get a 2nd? Better yet can @mtgreenee make the motion and get this show over with? #fireliz https://t.co/KF4bGJwsob And he seems ... nice. When a party accepts pedophiles child beaters abusers drunken attorneys rapists and that is all defensible but boy telling the truth on one indisputable issue can get you booted into darkness you may have some work to do.
