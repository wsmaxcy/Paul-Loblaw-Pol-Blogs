C, The Week in Pictures: Wide-Angle Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-05-08, Has there ever been a more fitting picture for our humble Week-in-Pictures feature than this seemingly LSD-infused pic of Joe Biden hulking over Rosalynn Carter? What’s up with this? Is the “one pill makes you larger” idea come to life? Not since a swamp rabbit attacked Jimmy Carter in 1979 has a photo seemed so unreal but perhaps it is a fitting metaphor of Biden’s bizarro left-wing presidency not to mention Biden’s trademark wide-mouth bass grin.                      Meanwhile:        Who knew that “Naked Gun” was a documentary.               Headlines of the week:                Florida Man is going to have to step up his game.                     There’s got to be some kind of epic story behind this pic.               And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
