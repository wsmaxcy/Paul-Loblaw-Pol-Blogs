L, Trump: The Key To Republican Success Is More Trumpism, Associated Press, 2021-04-10, PALM BEACH Fla. (AP) — Staking his claim to the Republican Party former President Donald Trump is casting his populist policies and attack-dog politics as the key to future GOP success. In a closed-door speech Saturday night to donors at his Mar-a-Lago resort Trump also reinforced his commitment to the party according to prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press. His appearance came as Republican officials are trying to play down an internal feud over Trump’s role in the party his commitment to GOP fundraising and his plans for 2024. While Trump’s advisers report he will emphasize party unity he rarely sticks to script. “The key to this triumphant future will be to build on the gains our amazing movement has made over the past four years” Trump told hundreds of leading Republican donors according to the prepared remarks. “Under our leadership we welcomed millions upon millions of new voters into the Republican coalition. We transformed the Republican Party into a party that truly fights for all Americans.” It was the final address of the Republican National Committee’s weekend donor summit in Palm Beach. Most of the RNC’s invitation-only gathering was held at a luxury hotel a few miles away; attendees were bused to Trump’s club for his remarks. While a significant faction of the Republican Party hopes to move past Trump’s divisive leadership the location of the event suggests that the GOP at least for now is not ready to replace Trump as its undisputed leader and chief fundraiser. Despite Saturday’s intended message Trump’s commitment to the GOP is far from certain. Earlier in the year he raised the possibility of creating a new political party. Just a month ago Trump’s political action committee sent letters to the RNC and others asking them to “immediately cease and desist the unauthorized use of President Donald J. Trump’s name image and/or likeness in all fundraising persuasion and/or issue speech.” GOP officials have repeatedly tried to play down the fundraising tensions and see Trump’s participation as a sign that he is willing to lend his name to the party. At the same time Trump continues to aggressively accumulate campaign cash to fuel his own political ambitions. Trump has also regularly attacked his Republican critics in recent weeks especially Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and No. 3 House Republican Liz Cheney. Neither attended the weekend donor summit.
