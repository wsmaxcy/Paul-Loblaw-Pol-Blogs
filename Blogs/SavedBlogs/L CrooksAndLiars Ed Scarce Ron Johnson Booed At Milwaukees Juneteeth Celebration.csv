L, Ron Johnson Booed At Milwaukee's Juneteeth Celebration, Ed Scarce, 2021-06-20, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Imagine how big a doofus you have to be to go to an event celebrating the passage of a bill that you almost single-handedly blocked the previous year. But if you're Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin it's just par for the course. Source: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel On Saturday during an otherwise joyful celebration of Juneteenth Day in Milwaukee U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson made an appearance at a Republican Party booth. Johnson told reporters that his experience interacting with attendees had been generally positive except for "one nasty comment." However as more people recognized him he was drowned out by a chorus of boos. Members of a growing crowd swore at him and said "We don't want you here." Last year the Wisconsin Republican blocked legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday. A local news report from Saturday: And some tweets that sum up the hubris of Ron Johnson: @SenRonJohnson This is the response you get when you put a hold on #Juneteenth from becoming a holiday and then have the audacity to show up at a #Juneteenth festival. pic.twitter.com/AvjOQ1MWkz â€” Chris Walton (@ChrisWaltonMKE) June 19 2021 Sen. Ron Johnson finds it "strange" that taxpayers will have to "provide federal employees paid time off to celebrate the end of slavery." I find it strange that taxpayers provide Johnson with a salary at all. Wisconsin Vote Smarter. Vote Blue!
