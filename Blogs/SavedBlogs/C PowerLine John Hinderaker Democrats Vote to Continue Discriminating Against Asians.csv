C, Democrats Vote to Continue Discriminating Against Asians, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-23, With race the topic du jour it is odd that more attention isn’t being paid to the most obvious discrimination in our society: that against Asians. While employers commonly engage in such discrimination the most viciously discriminatory organizations in our society are universities. Thus Senate Republicans offered an amendment to the new “COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act” that would have ended federal funding of universities that discriminate against Asian American applicants. The amendment sponsored by Ted Cruz and John Kennedy was narrowly defeated by Senate Democrats.

Let’s hope Asian voters notice. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
