L, Ted Cruz's Awkward Mar-A-Lago Photo Op With Trump Gets The Treatment On Twitter, Ed Mazza, 2021-05-05, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) bragged that he had a “great dinner” with former President Donald Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Tuesday night. But the moment looked more than a little awkward and not just because of the unusual framing of the photo.  During the campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination Trump called Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” attacked his wife’s looks and implied that his father was somehow involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  “He’s a nasty guy” Trump said of Cruz in 2016. “Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him.” Cruz for his part described Trump as a “pathological liar” and a “sniveling coward” and didn’t endorse him during a speech at the Republican National Convention. Cruz ultimately flip-flopped and backed Trump and has since become one of his staunchest defenders.  Twitter users had a lot of thoughts on the photo op:  siri show me literal hell https://t.co/fHlu9fH2nr What soul? pic.twitter.com/tpnjrjFGCF Ted even shrank his left hand to ingratiate himself with Trump https://t.co/ODea3Veg0K "He's in great spirits" 😂 Cruz trying to put Trump in the nursing home https://t.co/q4wLdOUPKY An entire political party continues to suck up to the election loser because they’re scared of his Twitter which he doesn’t even have anymore. https://t.co/tB2zA9agaD This is also my smile when I have a great dinner with a friend I respect. https://t.co/gsV74zeNwb Why would Texas voters trust him to keep faith with them when he dishonors his wife & his father with a smirk on his face? https://t.co/GKLpViqRQs trumps body language here is amazing he is literally trying to escape 😹 https://t.co/nLZb2KOi1n  pic.twitter.com/qhUv3eIq40 You can’t compromise with evil.
