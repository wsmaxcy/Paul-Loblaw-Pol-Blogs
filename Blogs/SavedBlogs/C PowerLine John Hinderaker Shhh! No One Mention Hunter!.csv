C, Shhh! No One Mention Hunter!, John Hinderaker, 2021-06-12, Clay Travis asks an excellent question: The New York Times wrote a front page article on a teenage girl a 15 year old who lost her ability to attend the University of Tennessee for doing what Hunter Biden did. Yet the NYT isn’t covering Hunter Biden at all. How can that be remotely justified? https://t.co/n2CSZeqZwr — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) June 9 2021  
Actually that question is easily answered. The New York Times is not a news organization it is an arm of the Democratic Party. As such its mission is to protect and defend the Biden administration. It has its hands full trying not mention that Joe Biden is non compos mentis and that things generally have gone to Hell in a handbasket since he took office. With remarkable speed if you think about it. So Hunter Biden is strictly off limits. Whom will the Times destroy a random 15-year-old girl or Joe Biden’s rich 51-year-old depraved racist drug-addled corrupt son? The question answers itself. It’s good to be a Democrat! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
