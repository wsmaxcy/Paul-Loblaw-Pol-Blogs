C, Podcast: Back to Wuhan with Spencer Case, Steven Hayward, 2021-01-28, Spencer Case Almost exactly a year ago I had Spencer Case on the show from Wuhan China where he had a front row seat to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of listeners wrote asking about Spencer and wanting to know if he got out and what he was up to. And now is the perfect time for a sequel and update: Spencer is back in Wuhan finishing up a post-doc fellowship at Wuhan University where he is working on two books and a pile of academic articles. Spencer has also started his own podcast Micro-Digressions and it is worth a listen if you have even a passing interest in philosophy. In this episode we not only talk about Spencer’s ordeal getting out of China last year but his ordeal getting back into China a few weeks ago and what Wuhan is like today. From there we take a brief tour of heroes and villains among modern philosophers. You can find Spencer’s excellent commentaries at Quillette National Review Online and elsewhere. You know what’s next: you listen therefore you are as Cartesian podcasters like to say. And if you’re a nihilist get it from the other guys. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
