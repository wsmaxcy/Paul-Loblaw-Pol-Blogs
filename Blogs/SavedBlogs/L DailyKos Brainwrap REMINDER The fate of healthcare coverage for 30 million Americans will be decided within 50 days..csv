L, REMINDER: The fate of healthcare coverage for 30 million Americans will be decided within 50 days., Brainwrap, 2021-05-11, The current session of the Supreme Court of the United States runs through the end of June. This means that unless they decide to punt until the next session a final SCOTUS decision on the insane absurd inane GOP-brought GOP-supported “Texas Fold’em” lawsuit to strike down the entire Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act will happen within the next 50 days. There’s four different possible ways it could go when they do so ranging from completely harmless to utter and complete disaster: This is what they should do. It’s an idiotic lawsuit in the first place which never should have made it past the first federal judge...and yet just like King v. Burwell here we are. If this happens it would be mildly irritating but effectively harmless: The ACA would no longer have even a hypothetical “individual mandate” requirement at the federal level (ironically CA DC MA NJ & RI have all since reinstated their own individual mandate penalties at the state level). However the ACA already effectively doesn’t have a federal mandate penalty now and hasn’t since January 1 2019 and it’s been chugging along for the past 2+ years with minimal damage. Zeroing out the federal penalty did cause ACA policy premiums to spike around 6-8% or so (roughly $580/yr per unsubsidized enrollee)...but for the most part that just caused ACA subsidies to spike accordingly costing taxpayers perhaps an additional $5 billion per year or so. Otherwise...that’s about it. This is the key to the entire case as well as the defense: The plaintiffs claim that the ACA can’t possibly function without the penalty...and yet here we are. If this happens it would amount to the status quo and all would be pretty much well. I see this as the most likely scenario especially since It would also give the conservative Justices “cover” since it would finally eliminate the single most “philosophically offensive” part of the ACA to Republicans even if only symbolically. The only downside to this ruling is that it would set a bad precedent for “severability” in future court rulings but that would probably just mean Congress/legislatures would have to be extra careful to include clauses in every paragraph of every bill saying “Oh this subsection is severable. Oh this one is severable as well...” This would lead to perhaps the strangest situation: On the upside major parts of the ACA like Medicaid expansion closure of the Medicare Part D “donut hole” and so forth would remain in place as would the financial subsidies for ACA exchange enrollees...but the ACA’s patient protections such as Guaranteed Issue Community Rating Essential Health Benefits caps on out of pocket expenses and the ban on annual/lifetime coverage limits would all be GONE. In other words insurance carriers would be able to go back to medical underwriting for major medical policies...which means they could once again deny coverage of people with pre-existing conditions (PECs) or charge those with PECs exorbitantly higher rates or simply refuse to cover the particular condition itself (like cancer for instance). Not only would this be devastating for as many as 130 million Americans it would also be a logistical and actuarial nightmare for the insurance carriers and the government due to how the ACA’s subsidies are structured. The ACA’s subsidy formula is based on the “benchmark Silver plan” available on the ACA exchange...that is the 2nd lowest-cost plan available. However the pricing of exchange plans (Bronze Silver Gold & Platinum) are all based on the assumption that everyone of a given age living in a given geographic region will be charged the same amount regardless of their medical condition gender etc. Once you bring back medical underwriting there is no benchmark plan to base subsidies on. The “2nd lowest-cost Silver” plan for one 30-yr old might be 5x higher than for another...or 50x higher (seriously there was a case in Iowa a few years back of a teenager with a rare form of hemophilia whose medical claims amounted to $1 million per month). This could potentially lead to a situation where someone’s official premiums were set at $50000/month...but with them receiving $49800/month in subsidies which would be insane. This was actually the original “solution” which then-US Attorney General Jeff Sessions (remember him?) was seeking in the early days of the lawsuit which was kind of strange...but it became irrelevant the following spring when new AG William Barr changed his mind and decided to ask for the entire law to be struck down “root and branch” as Mitch McConnell used to put it. THIS IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. If this happens: Yes that’s right: Even the estimated 1.5 million people who’ve JUST enrolled for expanded ACA subsidies via the American Rescue Plan would see those subsidies yanked away in many cases before they even receive their first tax credit. So what can President Biden and Congressional Democrats do about it? Well there’s three things they could do to #MootTheSuit...but each would be problematic for different reasons: The problem with b) and c) is that they can’t be done via reconciliation; they would have to pass the Senate via regular order which of course means...you guessed it...overcoming the filibuster. That leaves #1 which a lot of people thought could be done with just 51 votes via reconciliation process since that’s exactly how the GOP managed to change the penalty to $0 in the first place. HOWEVER in the most painful of ironies I’ve since been told that it wouldn’t be enough to simply restore the penalty to a nominal amount like $1.00 because that wouldn’t impact the budget enough. Apparently it would have to be restored to a larger amount. How much? I’m not sure but let’s say at least $100 or more. Of course if they’re gonna do that they might as well just restore it to the $695/person which it was in the first place. This leads to another potential problem: First actively restoring the penalty to the original amount could potentially be seen by SCOTUS as an “admission” that the case has merit in the first place. After all the logic goes why would they go through such lengths to reset the penalty unless they agreed that having a $0 penalty presented a problem? I agree that reasoning seems specious at best but that’s what I’ve been told by a few legal scholars so who the hell knows? Well believe it or not U of M law professor & ACA expert Nicholas Bagley says that it’s possible that they might be able to take action (i.e. one of the 3 options above) after the ruling comes out even if it has immediate effect: When the Supreme Court declares a law unconstitutional all it's saying is that it won't enforce the law. The executive branch goes along with that declaration usually willingly. But the law still remains on the books. So adding a $1 mandate should still do the trick even if the decision takes immediate effect. But lots of people share your intuition: that what the Supreme Court does is "strike down" laws. And that intuition is REALLY strong. So if Dems were to say "Well we're adding a $1 penalty that should fix it" they'd get pummeled over that. And I could imagine a skittish Manchin or Sinema not wanting to go along with that. Of course Bagley told me this before we knew that a “$1 penalty” wouldn’t be enough but the point is that they could theoretically save the ACA even after the ruling was given which I didn’t realize was doable. As for his point about Manchin/Sinema “not wanting to get pummeled” over something like that...well I’m pretty sure allowing healthcare coverage to be ripped away from nearly 10% of the population in the middle of a global pandemic and NOT doing anything to stop it when they could will get them “pummeled” a lot worse. (There’s also a couple of other possibilities such as SCOTUS kicking the case back down to the circuit court level or whatever but I’ve been told by several legal experts that this is extremely unlikely at this juncture). In any event The Sword of Damocles will continue to dangle over the entire nation’s head for anywhere from 1 to 50 more days.
