C, The Geek in Pictures: Contra-Grabber Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-25, • So it looks like we’re going to have another gun control debate because gun violence is an “epidemic” a public health problem (cue the CDC) because Americans own too many guns and are too violent. So I guess it’s time for a few charts on the subject whose conclusions you can draw yourself:     See also Slate on “Mass Shooters Aren’t Disproportionately White.” • Next up: hate crimes.

Key excerpt: A report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism drew national media attention for identifying a 149% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020 compared to 2019 in 16 of our largest cities.

Looks to me the main beneficiary of statehood would be white liberals. As usual.  • Elon Musk offers is this “data” for why we can’t nail down the UFO business (though I think he’s just covering his own tracks):  And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
