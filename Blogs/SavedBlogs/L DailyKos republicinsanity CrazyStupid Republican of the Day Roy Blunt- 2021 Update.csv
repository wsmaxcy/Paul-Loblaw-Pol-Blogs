L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Roy Blunt- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-06-30, In 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” published profiles of the U.S. Senator from Missouri Roy Blunt a man who somehow not only survived being caught up in the Abramoff scandal back when he was a member of the House but went on to be elected to the Senate in spite of also doing favors for the tobacco industry while being caught dating Abigail Perlman (now Abigail Blunt) a lobbyist for Phillip Morris.Since the Blunt family have still been repeated subjects of investigation of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington who have noted lobbying firms have a habit of hiring Blunt’s wife and two children and corresponding votes to reward this arrangement from Sen. Blunt. But Roy Blunt is most famous for his namesake the Blunt Amendment which was an attempt to strip women of having contraception covered by their insurance plans that led to the Congressional testimony of Sandra Fluke the insults lobbed at her by legendary bloviating ***hole (and friend of Blunt’s) Rush Limbaugh and the entire framing of the “War on Women” around the 2012 election. In 2013 Blunt also wrote what many critics described as the “Monsanto Protection Act” to allow the corporate agriculture company to plant seeds even if they were deemed genetically or biologically unsafe (and of course Blunt has also received contributions from Monsanto).We also sifted through Blunt’s voting record which included voting for the 2013 Government Shutdown while voting against LGBT rights at every opportunity the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act Disaster Relief for victims of Hurricane Sandy all measures on pay equality and raising the minimum wage and against Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform (coincidentally in 1999 Blunt voted to deregulate Wall Street to have a hand in creating the 2008 financial meltdown). Sen. Blunt is the man who used the excuse “I can barely schedule a call with my son’s math teacher yesterday so probably no” as to why he was opposed to Merrick Garland having a confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. He’s too busy for this whole Senate thing.But let us not forget that Roy Blunt would like to lay the blame for our student debt crisis where it belongs… on the students. Yes back in April of 2015 Blunt blamed high student debt on “higher living standards” that college students were enjoying these days. I’m sure it was news to all the kids in college out there living off ramen noodles that they’re splurging too much while they’re in school.And somehow don’t ask us how Roy Blunt won re-election in 2016 but only garnered 49% of the vote to do so.That may have had a lot to do with Blunt stoking the fears of Islamophobia by blaming Muslim communities for not doing enough to inform the government about terror suspects that Blunt feels are lying among their ranks or when he got on Twitter and posted that his opponent Democrat Jason Kander didn’t know enough about threats we face like “radical Islam”. (NOTE: Jason Kander is an Iraq War vet and actually fought against Islamic terrorists so…) Thus Roy Blunt went back to Washington in January 2017 and began signing off on every member of Trump’s Cabinet of Horrors. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.And while pausing on approving Betsy DeVos since she… you know has never worked as an educator that might have been the case for some moderate GOP Senators Roy Blunt was ready to rubber stamp her from the start. After all DeVos spent a fortune on trying to get Roy Blunt’s son Matt elected Governor of Missouri a couple years earlier in the hopes that her bogus voucher schools would become widely used in education throughout the state. To say nothing of all of the money DeVos gave to Sen. Blunt himself. He approved every Trump nominee no matter how unqualified no matter how much scandal in their personal background and every judge no matter how obviously non-partisan they are. Blunt voted to approve the nomination of William Barr to be the country’s Attorney General even though he was involved in the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s. He voted against witnesses being allowed in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump then voted to quit him in the Senate in spite of the mountain of evidence showing that he solicited foreign assistance in the 2020 elections.Roy Blunt still is a fine champion of women’s rights if you live on Bizarro World. In 2017 he dug in and refused to call for the resignation of Missouri Governor Eric Greitens who was not only embroiled in a case where he was accused of sexual assault and extortion with a mistress… but Eric Greitens was also simultaneously being investigated for breaking campaign finance law and a variety of other ethics charges. On February 25th 2020: Blunt voted for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act an insane piece of anti-choice legislation that would ask abortion providers to try to admit aborted fetuses to a hospital if they were “alive” after the procedure which is medically impossible given the age that abortions can be performed at.We’ll note that since the election in November it took all of a week before Roy Blunt started playing along with Donald Trump’s Big Lie and refusing to acknowledge Joe Biden would be the 46th president telling reporters:            ”The President wasn’t defeated by huge numbers – in fact he may not have been defeated at all.”      Through December Sen. Blunt was still trying to avoid saying that Biden had won:             ”Well the president-elect will be the president-elect when the electors vote for him. There is no official job president-elect.”      So of course a seditious dips*** this dedicated to what ended up causing the violent coup attempt carried out by Trump supporters on January 6th that he was a vote as a part of Senate Republicans’ filibuster to try to create a non-partisan investigation into the causes of the attack and hold those responsible accountable. Y’know like him for contributing to the lies.Blunt has been crooked as a snake with scoliosis and we were relieved to hear he will retire in 2022 and be leaving office likely to focus on trying to make his son into a political legacy (Please no).
