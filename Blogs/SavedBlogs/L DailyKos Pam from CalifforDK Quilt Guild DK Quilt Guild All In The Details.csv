L, DK Quilt Guild: All In The Details, Pam from CalifforDK Quilt Guild, 2021-06-27,   DK Quilt Guild: A place for quilters to gather share ideas projects and to make the world a better place one quilt at a time. Join us and share your thoughts projects questions and tips. Quilters here are at many different levels of skill. Beginners and non-quilters are welcome too.  We NEED diarists!Your diary can be elaborate and full of photos a simple story of your own quilting history or that of someone you love a discussion of a current project or a technique you're learning new adventures... You could post quilt retreat-day recipes (things like crockpot meals so food appears without much attention from you)...We could do show and tell or open thread also but either way we need diarists to host. It is EASY if you're willing to take the chance. Diary Schedule 07/04 — Happy Independence Day 07/11 — winifred3 07/18 — OPEN 07/25 — OPEN 08/01 — OPEN  Flickr page link to view more quilts.        These are lovely quilts but many are made by professional quilters. I attended the Quilt Shows pre-Covid and thought it would be fun to see the detail in the quilts. We can get get inspired by them. I still prefer the cozy well-loved quilts.
