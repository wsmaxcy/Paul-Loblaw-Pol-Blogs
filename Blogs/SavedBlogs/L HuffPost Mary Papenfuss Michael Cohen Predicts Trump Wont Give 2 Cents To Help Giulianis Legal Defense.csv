L, Michael Cohen Predicts Trump Won't Give '2 Cents' To Help Giuliani's Legal Defense, Mary Papenfuss, 2021-05-08, Donald Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen predicted that his ex-boss won’t give Rudy Giuliani “two cents” for legal fees to defend himself against any charges that might arise from a current federal investigation. “Let me be very clear: [Giuliani’s] going to get stiffed” Cohen told Joy Reid in an MSNBC interview Friday. “Donald Trump does not pay legal bills. He doesn’t care about anyone or anything other than himself.” Giuliani’s advisers earlier this week reached out to Trump’s team to shake loose some of the former president’s $250 million in campaign cash to reimburse Giuliani for his work attempting to overturn the 2020 election on Trump’s behalf.  But Cohen said there’s no way that will happen. “Donald in his crazy mind actually believes” that money is his “to do with” as he wishes Cohen told Reid. Giuliani now has a “better chance of sling-shooting himself to the moon” than getting a big pay day from the former president Cohen added.  “Donald Trump wouldn’t pay him two cents because his feeling is it’s an honor and a privilege to go to prison for him to do his dirty work” he said. Cohen should know. He was sentenced to three years in prison for a variety of crimes committed while he was Trump’s lawyer including lying to Congress during its probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign finance violations and tax fraud. Now Giuliani’s in the hot seat for work he did in Ukraine to dig up unflattering information about now-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter ahead of the 2020 election. In their effort to find communication between Ukrainian officials and the Trump administration federal investigators last week seized more than 10 computers and phones from Giuliani’s Manhattan home and office. The Justice Department is reportedly focusing in part on Giuliani’s efforts to oust Marie Yovanovitch from her job as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She was reportedly unpopular with some Ukrainian officials because of her strong stance against corruption. Trump booted Yovanovitch from her post in 2019.  It’s possible Yovanovtich may have been forced out as part of a deal to get dirt on Biden. Cohen believes Giuliani will eventually act out of self interest though. Late last month on CNN he said: “Do I think Rudy will give up Donald in a heartbeat? Absolutely. He certainly doesn’t want to follow my path down into a 36-month sentence.” Check out Cohen’s MSNBC interview up top.
