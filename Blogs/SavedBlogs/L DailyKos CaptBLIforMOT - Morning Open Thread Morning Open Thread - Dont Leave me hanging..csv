L, Morning Open Thread - Don't Leave me hanging., CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-05-04,    Surprise!  There’s no need to adjust your settings.  It is Not Sunday (my normal hosting time). Something out of place today does not mean it is bad or good.  Sometimes an out of place thing is just different.  And today is different. Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum.  Just like every day the diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. Every photo in this diary provides the world with oxygen and shade food and housing for wild life and graces the road borders where I take my walks.  I wanted to share the various leaves I see everyday as I stroll through life.    The shapes sizes and hues of each leaf is unique as is the tree that dons the greenery. Now for a little music to round out the morning.  Sometimes too many words get in the way of a good conversation.     Share your thoughts this bright and promising morning.
