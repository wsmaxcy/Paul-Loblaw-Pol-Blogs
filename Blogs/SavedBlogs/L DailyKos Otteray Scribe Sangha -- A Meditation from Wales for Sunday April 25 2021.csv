L, Sangha -- A Meditation from Wales for Sunday April 25 2021, Otteray Scribe, 2021-04-25, Welcome to members of the Daily Kos Sangha* and all interested visitors who happen by. Each of us has our own path; we come here by way of many different traditions and of no particular tradition. While the language we use may differ depending on the traditions teachers practices and teachings that have shaped our journeys we find in common generally a search for who we truly are our true nature and to bring the peace and compassion born of that search into the greater world of which we area part. If you wish to share or if you seek support or if you simply want to say hello please do as this space is for you. I have written of Scotland and its music many times.  There is another Celtic nation with a long and proud history of song as meditation.  Wales has a deeply spiritual culture nurtured by a land of beautiful hills and coal mines.  The land has influenced their music especially the tradition of choral singing mostly in churches.  Welsh is a beautiful language as well lending itself to songs that go back into the dim mists of forgotten times when Druids walked the holy places. Welsh hymns and songs are often intended to induce meditative trance much like shape-note hymn singing in the American heartland. 1000 o leisiau yn canu Blaenwern yn Neuadd Albert yn Llundain. Band y Cory yn cyfeilio:  Myfanwy: considered by many musicologists to be the most beautiful song in the Welsh language.  Y Galwd is about a Druid prince who hears sounds calling him from Britain which is being ravaged by the advancing Roman army. He sets out on the long journey to sacrifice himself on the Black Lake (Y Llyn Du) as a messenger for the Druid gods to save his Welsh homeland. Lyrics: Y wawr yn torri Mae'r tyndra yn esgyn Fy nghyned yn aros Rwy'n barod i'r siwrne Henuriaid yn galw O fore tan nos Maen't yn aros am yr aberth A fydd i'w rhoi rhyddhad Yn gynnar yn y boreL leisiau yn fy ngalw Yr amser wedi cyrraedd Ac mae'n rhaid i'm fynd Wedi treilio amryw flwyddyn Paratoi am yr eiliad hon Er mwyn rhoi fy nghorff mewn offrwm I'r Derwyddon Nemaste Peace this day and every day.  Take this time to sit and quietly take in your surroundings in a comfortable place.  Do not dwell on thoughts that enter your mind for long as the need to empty the mind while sitting is what is to be realized all the while concentrating on your breath:  Breath in and exhale out and truly realize the moment of this time that is just for you it is your place your time you are at home. This is an open thread. Please add your thoughts meditations and reflections as you wish.  *Attribution: Creator of Dkos Sangha Weekly Thread Brother “davehouck”.
