C, I’m a young first-time voter. Here’s why I’m casting my ballot for Trump, Chase Watkins, 2020-11-02, Most young people vote Democrat here’s why I’m going against the grain. The Democratic Party has long fancied itself as the party of young voters and its right. A recent Harvard study found that young people are leaning heavily toward Joe Biden in this election cycle. But honestly I don’t understand why this is. Why are young people more inclined to be Democrats? After all we don’t like anyone telling us what to do and the party of less regulation and more freedom is the Republican Party. There’s nothing new or rebellious about being a Democrat either; except maybe doing it because you don’t want to follow in your parents footsteps but that doesn’t make sense because your parents are probably Democrats too. Is inheriting and then parroting your parents’ opinions now the rebellious thing to do? Also the Democratic Party is literally the oldest political party ever. What’s hip and cool about an institution that aged? Now you might argue that the Republican Party is old and non-rebellious too and that’s true but at least we own it. The Party that stood up to racism freed the slaves and now tries to defend freedom of the individual and encourage limited government that’s the GOP for you. I support the current President and I believe he should be elected for another term especially since the choice is between Trump and Biden. Fundamentally I want to be free. I want the liberty to choose my own way in this world. I want to shape my own future and I want as few rules as possible in constraining how I do so. This desire necessities a vote for President Trump. I want to keep more of my money and that means less taxes (or at least not raising them higher). I want the freedom to defend myself my family and my country with an AR-style gun platform if I deem it necessary and that means not adding more gun control laws to the already-overflowing infringing books (something Joe Biden leading the most anti-Second Amendment major ticket ever would love nothing more to do). I support America’s police force and I think they should have more funding not less. Especially during a time like this—with wide-spread riots and civil unrest—the police need more money allocated toward them for better training both physically and mentally help dealing with psychological trauma that sometimes comes with the job and more community outreach. Trump is in favor of more police funding Biden says their funds should be “absolutely” be redirected. As for COVID-19 I believe the person leading our country should get us out of lockdown back to work open up schools and remain optimistic about the future of this country while at it—all things Trump has done or wants to do. Conversely Biden won’t rule out the possibility of more lockdowns. Which one means more freedom for me and the American people? President Trump obviously. All that aside though who do you think is better equipped to bring America and its economy back: the businessman who presided over the best economy in 50 years before the pandemic or a guy who’s been in politics for 47 years who with Obama presided over our nation’s sluggish economic comeback after the Great Recession? You decide but I’m going with Trump. Other than an attitude of more freedom with less regulations Trump is the first U.S. President in the past 40 years who hasn’t gotten our country into another war. That’s a big deal! That being said he still managed to kill multiple terrorist leaders neutralizing their threat to our country and the West more broadly. Qasim al-Rimi Ayman al-Zawahiri Qassem Soleimani Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Abu Hassan al-Muhajir and Hamza bin Laden were all individuals put down through President Trump’s authorization of military missions. Contrast this to Biden’s foreign policy decisions and opinions which are so bad they promoted former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates who served under the Obama-Biden Administration to remark that Joe has been “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” From the former VP opposing the bin-Laden raid to the Obama-Biden Administration cutting the military budget Gates is absolutely right. Trump seems to be pursuing an aggressive Reagan-style peace-through-strength military and foreign policy while Biden seems to support the opposite. Religious freedom might be the worse-scoring round for Biden though. The former Vice President has condemned the Hyde Amendment—which in a saving grace to religious Americans prohibits federal funding of abortions except in cases of rape incest or when the life of the mother is in danger—and now fully supports forcing religious people to pay for the medical practice which they strongly disagree with most considering it a serious sin. Furthermore Biden literally wants to sue Catholic Nuns for following their deep religious beliefs and not providing birth control and abortifacient drugs to their employees. In fact Joe Biden’s views on abortion policy are so radical he’s recently been denied Holy Communion the past. On the other hand Trump opposes Biden’s positions on those issues and has committed to “protect[ing] unborn life through every means available.” Regardless of your opinion on abortion most Americans agree that forcing someone to violate their deeply held religious convictions and pay for another person’s abortion is wrong (even the liberal outlet Slate noted this fact in a 2019 piece). You decide which side is on that of freedom and the American way but it’s obvious to me. The former Vice President’s radical position on abortion starkly contrasts his attempt at running a moderate Warren G. Harding-style “return to normalcy” campaign. In another instance of radicalism Biden has refused to say whether he’ll pack the Supreme Court if elected a move that would essentially destroy the institution creating a sort of arms race with every side adding more and more Justices with each election cycle. Biden said voters don’t deserve to know his position on packing the court mentioning that we’ll know what he thinks on the matter after the election. Somewhat reversing his position after receiving blowback for his comments Biden retreated: “What I will do is I’ll put together a national commission of bipartisan commission of scholars constitutional scholars Democrats Republicans liberal conservative. And I will—ask them to over—180 days come back to me with recommendations as to how to—reform the court system because it’s getting out of whack—the way in which it’s being handled and it’s not about court packing.” Biden’s running mate Senator Kamala Harris hasn’t been so mysterious with her position on packing the court however. Last year she told the New York Times she is “absolutely open to” packing the SCOTUS echoing earlier hints she dropped to Politico regarding the subject. Additionally during the Vice-Presidential Debate Senator Harris repeatedly refused to answer the question of whether she’s in favor of packing the court presumably because she didn’t want the American people to actually know what she believes. In this election cycle many Democrats have not only proposed packing the highest court in the nation they’ve suggested doing away with the Senate filibuster adding new states (including Washington D.C.) and abolishing the Electoral College. These major changes are radical go against the Founding Father’s vision for the country and would if not destroy cause the citizenry to lose faith in the institutions of American’s governmental structure. I for one don’t want that so I’m voting for Trump. In this election cycle there’s also the point Trump repeatedly brought up during both Presidential Debates to which Biden could never generate a good answer: Joe has been in politics for 47 years much of that time in the Senate and eight years of which was spent holding the Vice-Presidency why didn’t he enact the policy preferences earlier he wants now? If the system is so broken that Joe feels he must fix it isn’t he partly to blame? Why does he deserve another four to eight years in Government? It doesn’t make any sense. I believe in the old adage “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results” so I’m casting my ballot for Trump. In my opinion most of the opposition to Trump centers around a character-based argument: “he’s mean breaks rules of civility and the tweets are off-putting” critics say. Conversely Biden is presented as polite and civil “he’ll return the soul of the nation” supporters say. But don’t get lost in the hyperbole Joe is actually quite mean to people too. The difference is President Trump like most comedians usually “punches up” meaning he insults and demeans people like government figures actors late night comedians news organizations and reporters—people who have power and influence too. Granted this doesn’t make his behavior right it’s still disgusting and off-putting not to mention wrong morally speaking but Biden is worse. The former VP usually berates is rude to and sometimes gets physical with regular average Americans—Joe often bullies the little guy. The former VP declared in a town hall that an Iowa voter was a “damn liar” after the man brought up questions about alleged Biden family corruption Joe’s age and fitness for office. Biden went on to call the man “fat” after challenging the curious voter to a physical fitness and IQ test. Additionally in another campaign event Joe called a student asking a question about his ability to win the Presidency a “lying dog-faced pony soldier” accusing her of fibbing about her attendance at a Democratic caucus. Even worse Biden accused a Detroit voter of being “full of sh**” a “horse’s ass” and threatened to physically assault the man after the voter asked the former VP a question about gun rights. In another instance Joe got physical with an Iowa climate activist after the man questioned the former VP on climate policy pressing and poking the activist in the chest and later grabbing his jacket with both hands. None of these exchanges are the marks of a civil or polite man. In addition to being a mean man Joe Biden is also a typical politician and by that I mean he flip-flops on issues whenever he thinks it will help him win politically. Though there are many more instances the Hyde Amendment the threat of China and most notably fracking are all examples of his anyway-the-wind-blows attitude. I’m already over 1500 words into this piece and I haven’t even touched on alleged Biden family corruption most of which is just coming out now the former VP’s appearing declining cognitive abilities his hugely inappropriate behavior around women and young girls and the numerous scandals under the Obama-Biden Administration—including Fast and Furious gun trafficking and IRS targeting of conservative groups. On the other hand Trump stands for something gets stuff done and obviously loves this country (as evidenced by the RNC). Overall when I look at both candidates their pasts accomplishments failures and current platforms the two men have already made the choice of voting for me. I don’t think after 47 years Joe Biden deserves another four but I believe Donald Trump does.
