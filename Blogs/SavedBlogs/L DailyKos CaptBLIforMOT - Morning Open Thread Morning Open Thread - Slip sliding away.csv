L, Morning Open Thread - Slip sliding away, CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-04-27, There’s no need to adjust your settings.  It is Not Sunday (my normal hosting time).  Something out of place today does not mean it is bad or good.  Sometimes an out of place thing is just different. Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum.  Just like every day the diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug.  Some of us go to work after a few hours of chatting and return later. Join us please. Welcome to another Tuesday.  I wondered if the Talking Heads thought of this site this day and the possibility that I might be a guest host for Dijit’s normal time slot.  Let’s compare the coincidence of my presence with their past prophecies (presented in song).   And another thing … It is hard to remember where all your freckles are when you check for ticks.  It’s Spring here in Mississippi and as an outdoorsman I check daily.  As parasites emerge from their long winter’s nap please be aware that you must be safe and take care of yourselves or do what James Brown suggests.     I can’t ignore today’s title without the reference song being included.  So without further ado I present Paul Simon.   In parting I’d like to thank Dijit for allowing me the opportunity to host today.  This song is for you.  I hope you take a few moments to watch the Turtles ( with unplugged instruments) have a musically flawless segment.  I aspire for such a performance.    So here we are folks at the start of another Tuesday.  Glad you made it.  Thanks DJ.
