L, New Day Cafe: Pizza Balls, ChrisloveforNew Day Cafe, 2021-07-03, Good morning Newdists! It’s been a while since I’ve hosted one of these. In case you don’t know Crimson Quillfeather is taking a couple of months off and I’m filling in for July. So you’re stuck with me today and the next four Saturdays. So the BF and I are planning a trip to my ancestral homeland of western Pennsylvania. This is a big deal because this will be the first time he has ever met my family in person (which is still shocking to me considering how long we’ve been together but it’s a long trip and it just never worked out before). We’re leaving in a little under two months and I know I’m going to have to be the tour guide so I’m trying to plan things out. A good portion of the trip will just be taking him places that mean something to me and trying to find the most scenic spots (because scenery is most of what western PA has to offer). The hard part is the food. We’re both foodies—and while I know what I’m getting myself into when I go back home he doesn’t. And I’m trying to prepare him for the dearth of really good food options we’re going to have. The depth of his lack of understanding became apparent a few nights ago when he said “We could just Yelp.” I was like “Oh that’s cute.” That being said there are some hidden gem local restaurants. Well maybe I should put that in the past tense. One “hidden gem” I was looking forward to taking him to is owned by a couple that completely lost their minds and went full QAnon over the past few years and they’re currently facing federal charges for their role in the Capitol insurrection. Yeah seriously. So that one can be crossed off the list. But wait! There’s still pizza balls! What the fuck is a pizza ball you ask? (That was literally the BF’s question to me when I brought it up: “What the fuck is a pizza ball?”) Well it’s a little chunk of heaven rolled into a ball and deep-fried. I don’t know if my words can do it justice. But imagine a chunk of pizza dough rolled up with cheese and pepperoni battered and fried with a side of marinara sauce for dipping. That’s a pizza ball. Not to be confused with...a pizza ball. There’s a restaurant back home that is actually a seafood restaurant (the entire place is decked out in ship and fish decor) but became locally famous for their pizza and pizza balls. The pizza is admittedly not the best but it’s what I grew up on so it falls into the category of comfort food. The pizza balls on the other hand...those are objectively the best. Pizza balls are served at a few different places in the area but other places tend to bake their balls which results in an inferior pizza ball. There are local divides on this subject—I know my brother falls in the “baked balls” camp but he’s objectively wrong. Anyway you could go to this restaurant order three pizza balls for just a few bucks and eat like a king because these things were huge. When I think comfort foods pizza balls are at the very top of the list. Well...imagine my devastation when I googled this restaurant and saw the “permanently closed” marking. There goes my childhood. Another restaurant to cross off the list. This sent me down a pizza ball rabbithole though and I’ve come to the conclusion that the pizza balls I enjoyed so much really were kind of a unique thing. There are plenty of “pizza balls” out there but none of the pizza balls I’m finding are quite the same as the ones I remember. This recipe is probably the most similar (click the link for pics). I found other versions on YouTube but—while they all look delicious—none of them are “right.” This one is almost there but a little piece of pepperoni on the outside is no substitute for a handful of pepperoni on the inside. This one is made with chicken...wtf? This one is nothing like what I’m talking about but it does look good. By the way pizza balls are not to be confused with pepperoni rolls (the West Virginia delicacy). We had pepperoni rolls too but you got those in a bag from the bakery. They made for a nice snack but pizza balls were a meal.  Pepperoni bread looks yummy too. This has been an interesting diversion but I guess it’s back to the drawing board for the Pennsylvania trip. Maybe I’ll have to settle for baked balls after all.
