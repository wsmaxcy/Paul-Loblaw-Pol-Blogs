L, The 'iffy' grip of Trumpism and its cold dead hands still grifting, annieliforthe End of the Republic, 2021-04-22, People who recognized their based(sic) bigotry and hatred chose their orange ‘leader’ because ‘owning libs’ fit a general dickishness that conferred a gang-like belonging. Probably more striking are those women willing to identify with toxic masculinity and buy into the grift even after the 1/6 insurrection failed. The 21st Century’s Lost Cause market for Jim and Jill Crow is still being conned by previous guy.  Analysis | A key question moving forward: Is Trump’s grip on the GOP stronger than his base’s? https://t.co/yQ7htQJtx5 The argument made by a super PAC associated with former national security adviser John Bolton centered on the extent to which Republican voters were still likely to follow Trump’s political lead. The desired outcome here is obvious: Bolton who became a vocal Trump critic wants to suggest to Republicans that the political cost of bucking Trump has faded. Ergo the poll. [...] This is all a theoretically interesting debate and one that is in fact likely to hold some sway with Republican elected officials. But a fight centered on the political prospects and power of Trump on an individual basis is a fight that sits somewhat to the side of the actual struggle within the party at the moment. The question is often less about what Trump does than the extent to which Republicans are viewed as loyal to Trumpism as a (nebulous) concept. The yardstick against which Republican officials are often measured isn’t “Does Trump approve?” but “Does Trump’s base approve?” — a different and trickier calculus. www.washingtonpost.com/… Ted Cruz goes full Trump with his lies about stolen Republican Supreme Court seats https://t.co/hfJhOSSDgP This is a sign of how the Republican Party is adjusting to post-Trump life. It has embraced Trumpism without Trump. This is not really a set of policy preferences; the GOP in 2020 passed on a platform beyond allegiance to the Orange Emperor’s whims. It is more of a mindless obnoxious attitude — it’s all about “owning the libs” spreading conspiracy theories and waging culture wars as a way to rile up the rabid base and keep the cash register ringing. www.washingtonpost.com/...
