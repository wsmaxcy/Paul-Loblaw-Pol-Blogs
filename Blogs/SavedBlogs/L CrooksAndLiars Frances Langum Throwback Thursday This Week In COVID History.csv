L, Throwback Thursday: This Week In COVID History, Frances Langum, 2021-05-06, Thank the stars for Jimmy Kimmel.   Some may want to forget that Trump ever existed and that's an easy thing to understand.   But forgetting the past (The George W. Bush administration anyone?) is what let the Republican Party back into power. Never ever forget that it was Republicans that gave us Trump and that to this day lies about Covid-19.  Jimmy Kimmel's feature "Today in COVID History" remembers... ...Donald Trump saying he was treated worse than Lincoln by the media....Fox News personalities dissing "experts" for demanding social distancing....Laura Ingraham specifically praising hydrocloriquine and scoffing at predictions of deaths in the hundreds of thousands. All just one year ago.   Never forget. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit. We work 7 days a week 16 hours a day for our labor of love but with rising hosting and associated costs we need your help! Could you donate $21 for 2021?
