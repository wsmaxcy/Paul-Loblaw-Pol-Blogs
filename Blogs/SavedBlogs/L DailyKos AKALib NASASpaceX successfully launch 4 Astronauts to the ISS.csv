L, NASA/SpaceX successfully launch 4 Astronauts to the ISS, AKALib, 2021-04-23, NASA and SpaceX successfully launched four Crew-2 astronauts into Earth orbit early morning today at 5:49 a.m. EDT from Launch Complex 39A at NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Crew Dragon spacecraft named Endeavour will dock autonomously with¬†the¬†International Space Station‚Äôs¬†Harmony module around 5:10 a.m. EDT tomorrow Saturday April 24. In addition to the 4 astronauts Crew Dragon is delivering almost 250 pounds of cargo new science hardware and experiments. This mission features the first reuse of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket on a crew mission ‚Äì Crew Dragon Endeavour flew the historic Demo-2 mission and the Falcon 9 flew astronauts on the Crew-1 mission. Liftoff! The Crew-2 mission lifts off on a @SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from @NASAKennedy and is on the way to @Space_Station. More launch photos coming keep checking back! https://t.co/56Am0ERBaK pic.twitter.com/cyOfCJMqtr For a short time the number of crew on the space station will increase to 11 people until Crew-1 astronauts Walker Hopkins Glover and Noguchi return on Wednesday April 28 in the¬†Crew-1 SpaceX Dragon spacecraft Resilience. The Crew-2 members will¬†conduct science¬†and maintenance during a six-month stay aboard the orbiting laboratory and will return no earlier than Oct. 31. The Crew-2 Astronauts Here is some background on the astronauts from www.nasa.gov/‚Ä¶¬†‚Äî¬† Shane Kimbrough¬†of NASA 53 is the commander of the Crew-2 mission. He has made two previous trips to space;¬†Kimbrough first launched aboard space shuttle Endeavour for a visit to the station on the STS-126 mission in 2008 and then aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft for his first long-duration mission for Expedition 49/50 in 2016. He has spent a total of 189 days in space and performed six spacewalks. K. Megan McArthur¬†of NASA¬†49 is pilot of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and second-in-command for the mission. This¬†will be her first trip to the space station. Dr. McArthur launched on space shuttle Atlantis as a mission specialist on STS-125 the final Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission in 2009. McArthur operated the shuttle‚Äôs robotic arm over the course of the 12 days 21 hours she spent in space capturing the telescope and moving crew members during the five spacewalks needed to repair and upgrade it.¬†McArthur has a doctorate in oceanography from the University of California San Diego. Akihiko Hoshide¬†of JAXA the Japanese space agency 52 is a mission specialist for Crew-2.¬†Once aboard the station Hoshide will become a flight engineer for Expedition 65.¬†Hoshide is a veteran of two spaceflights. In June 2008 he flew to the International Space Station on the STS-124 mission to deliver the Japanese Experiment Module "Kibo" to the station. From July to November 2012 he stayed on the space station for 124 days as a flight engineer for the Expedition 32/33 mission. The Crew Dragon will be the third spacecraft that Noguchi has flown to the orbiting laboratory. Thomas Pesquet¬†of ESA the European Space Agency¬†43 will be a mission specialist for Crew-2.¬†He previously flew as part of Expeditions 50 and 51 launching aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in October 2016 and spending 196 days in space returning to Earth in June 2017. His mission also included two spacewalks to maintain the station: one to replace batteries on an electrical channel and one to detect a cooling leak and service the robotic arm. All 4 astronauts have been vaccinated.

Per tradition we zapped it with our mission decal. Many thanks to our outstanding training team for getting us ready. Tomorrow we depart for Kennedy Space Center! pic.twitter.com/oUhWoTz4CT The Mission The Crew-2 members will¬†conduct science¬†and maintenance during their¬†six-month stay. Astronauts also will conduct a variety of spacewalks outside the space station including the solar array installation. An important scientific focus on this expedition is a continuation of the¬†Tissue Chips in Space¬†study. Tissue chips are small models of human organs containing multiple cell types that behave much the same as they do in the body.¬†Tissue chips use¬†a combination of cells engineering and materials to restore maintain improve or replace biological tissues. Tissues engineered on Earth require some sort of scaffold on which to grow and can only reach a thickness of at most 1 centimeter or just over a quarter inch. But in microgravity rather than growing in a flat layer cells can grow into three dimensions that closely mimic tissues in the body. These chips may make it possible to identify safe and effective therapeutics ‚Äì drugs or vaccines ‚Äì much more quickly than the standard process. In addition many changes occurring in the human body during spaceflight resemble the onset and progression of aging and diseases on Earth but occur much more quickly in microgravity. Scientists use specialized tissue chips in space to model diseases that affect specific organs in the human body but that might take months or years to develop on Earth. From www.nasa.gov/‚Ä¶ which has more details about the science experiments¬†‚Äî Another important element of Crew-2‚Äôs mission is updating the station‚Äôs solar power system by installing the ISS Roll-out Solar Array (iROSA) ‚Äì compact panels that roll open like a huge yoga mat.¬†In 2017 the basic design underwent¬†testing¬†on the space station to determine its strength and durability. The Expedition 65 crew is scheduled to begin preparations for supplementing the station‚Äôs existing rigid panels this summer with the first pair of¬†six new arrays. Another experiment¬†CHIME will study¬†possible causes for suppressed immune response in microgravity. Microgravity may cause changes to the human immune system a possible concern for long-term space travel. The CHIME investigation could help identify potential causes of immune system dysfunction and lead to ways to prevent or counteract it helping space travelers as well as those with compromised immune systems on Earth.

The @SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was clearly visible over #Pittsburgh this morning! Absolutely incredible to witness this in person. Never thought my first rocket launch would be from right here. Insane! pic.twitter.com/YVEZLYsYvg A glorious time-lapse featured on APOD - The pre-dawn sky first seemed serene yesterday morning over Indian Harbor Beach in Florida USA. But then it lit up with a rocket launch.This time lapse by Eric Holland compressing 12-minutes into 8-seconds -- shows the bright launch plume of SpaceX Crew-2 https://t.co/atfGMiGieF pic.twitter.com/nRnKuMhSEv Epilogue Happy Earth Day (again) and best wishes for a successful mission. Here is a¬†beautifully narrated short film on observing Earth from a vantage point that¬†creates a profound shift in the worldview of those who experience it first hand (aka the¬†Overview Effect).
