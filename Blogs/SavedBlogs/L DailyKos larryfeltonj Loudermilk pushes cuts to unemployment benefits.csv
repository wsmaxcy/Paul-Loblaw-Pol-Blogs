L, Loudermilk pushes cuts to unemployment benefits, larryfeltonj, 2021-05-11, U.S. Representative Barry Loudermilk of the Georgia 11th District has added his voice to the coordinated GOP chorus to cut unemployment benefits while the economic effects of the pandemic are still ongoing. With an almost comically gerrymandered district resembling Bart Simpson in profile wearing a huge hat Loudermilk represents Cherokee and Bartow counties the northern portion of Cobb County and a sliver of Fulton County. In a press release Loudermilk repeated the Republican claim that the federal supplement to unemployment is causing a labor shortage.  With the Democrats controlling both houses of Congress plus the presidency Loudermilk’s bill is doomed but it’s part of a growing movement of GOP-controlled states to cut benefits to the unemployed.
