L, Obama strategist: Why McConnell loves Joe Biden the filibuster and the Trump Republican, Egberto Willies, 2021-06-30, Make no mistake McConnell is playing Democrats and using the so-called moderate Republicans as tools. Chai Komanduri an Obama strategist gets it. See full episodes here. Former Obama strategist Chai Komanduri appeared with Ari Melber and pointed out quite a few inconvenient truths. Recently President Biden appeared on the White House lawn with Democratic and Republican Senators to tout a bipartisan infrastructure agreement. Understand when it comes to bipartisanship it generally means Democrats acquiesce to the lowest common denominator the maximum which is not much that Republicans will offer. Komanduri said as much when he stated that Donald Trump would have had no problem signing the bipartisanship infrastructure deal (with or without Democrats). Ari pointed out that Mitch McConnell is happy with Joe Biden because he still believes in the “moderate” mantra. To highlight that he played a clip where he asked McConnell which of all recent Democratic Presidents would he not mind being on a deserted island with good old Joe. The Obama strategist had a lot more prescient information. He pointed out why McConnell prefers the Trump Republican over the moderate Republican. He also pointed out the reasons for Republican voter suppression. We can learn a lot from the video clip. McConnell knows that Democrats continue to play by the rules. He also knows he has no intentions of doing so. As such he will continue to have the upper hand until Democrats stop bringing a knife to a gunfight. One must ask if that is what they really want to do. I will discuss more of that on Politics Done Right.
