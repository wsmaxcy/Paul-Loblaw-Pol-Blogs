L, Another Saturday Night - The Letter “P”, WYgalinCaliforThe Village, 2021-05-08,  Good evening everybody and welcome to another Saturday night of music memories and conversations.  We have been busy counting down the letters in our “Alphabet Series”  and we continue that tonight.  For those who are new to our Saturday night celebrations we ask that you include the name and artist along with your selection.  Those of us using the smaller devices?  We thank you. As I started my journey to find a good tune I began to realize that this is a very good letter.  I’m starting off my choices with a great 70’s song by a group called Wild Cherry. A shout out to my daughter with my next selection.  The one and only Madonna and You know how this works — Put your quarter in the slot and your song in the comments.  This is your Saturday night jukebox and the party starts NOW.
