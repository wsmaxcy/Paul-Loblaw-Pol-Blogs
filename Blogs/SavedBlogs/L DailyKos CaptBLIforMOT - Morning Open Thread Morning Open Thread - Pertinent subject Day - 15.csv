L, Morning Open Thread - Pertinent subject Day - 15, CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-06-27, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve been given the task of hosting the Sunday edition of the MOT time.  I am not sure what we will discover today.  Let’s see what we can explore. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. I was thinking of what subject I might focus on today.  I decided to submit some of Hay seed’s photos as a tribute to his growing skill in photography.  Tributes are the pertinent subject today.     John Lennon wrote a beautiful song as a tribute to his mother.  Here is the haunting and somber tune.   A most beautiful structure in Agra India was built as a tribute to a woman by the man that loved her.  I want to include this musical score.  It is Morning and this piece demonstrates a majestic expression of new beginnings.    Here are a few more of Hay seed’s photos to admire.   Please pull up a seat and visit a while.  I’d like to hear what’s been going on in you world lately.
