L, Thyroid Patients Need Better Treatment NOW, StarrD, 2021-07-06, Hi all.  In memory of my brother Jordan who was a Hashimoto’s patient I’m trying toget better treatment for thyroid patients through a petition I’m doing. Thyroid affects how every cell and organ functions and carries on metabolism so it’s important that itworks right.  Many people with thyroid issues have not been taken seriously enough over the years by the medical and pharmaceutical communities and it needs to stop.  I’m hoping you’ll sign and share this petition.  Here’s the link:  www.change.org/...I think Jordan had undiagnosed &  untreated thyroid for too many years and it led to his liver going bad.   He ended up in the hospital in 2015 where his liver got diagnosed and I begged them to run thyroid tests—because I felt there wasa connection.  We have a big family history of thyroid trouble and Jordan didn’t evendrink or anything to have a bad liver.  He had low thyroid symptoms for years though.At the hospital the typical thyroid tests came out “normal” as usual… But I did more research and I found that if you get blood tests for thyroid antibodiesthese can sometimes show there’s a thyroid problem even if the usual tests are OK.I had to beg the doctors to run these tests.  Finally did and Jordan was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s autoimmune thyroid.  He started treatment and it helped to someextent but it wasn’t enough to repair the liver damage done.It shouldn’t have come to all this.  It should’ve been caught a lot earlier.  I think hisliver would’ve functioned better then and he wouldn’t have ended up needing aliver transplant which we couldn’t get in time due to Covid.  We came very close but right when he was in the hospital again waiting for a new liver in March 2020they stopped getting donor organs and doing transplant surgeries because of thevirus.  Needless to say I am heartbroken!!My petition asks the Biden Administration to help with more funding for researchinto better treatments for thyroid patients (which includes me as I strugglewith them) earlier & better testing and diagnosis of thyroid problems bettereducation for doctors on how treating the thyroid well can help prevent otherhealth problems from happening better oversight of the drugs we already haveetc.  Please consider signing and sharing my petition.  Maybe it could help youor someone you love in the future.  Jordan was the last member of my immediate family—he tried to look out for me with all the health trouble I’ve had due to thyroid and I tried to look out for himas best I could.  I couldn’t do well enough for him or our mom with this thyroidissue and it wasn’t all my fault because changes need to be made regardingthyroid patients and how they’re treated in so many ways.  Thank you for readingthis and for any support you might give.  If the petition link doesn’t work youcan also find it on my Facebook page for it called Thyroid Patients Need BetterTreatment NOW.  https://www.facebook.com/ThyroidNow   Thank you again….from Jordan’s sister Starr D.
