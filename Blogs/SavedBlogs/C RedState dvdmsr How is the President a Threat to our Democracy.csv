C, How is the President a Threat to our "Democracy"?, dvdmsr, 2020-09-24, Okay can someone please explain to me how President Trump is supposedly a threat to our “democracy”? I keep hearing the talking heads on the Left saying that. I suppose it has a lot to do with what they mean by “democracy” because I wasn’t aware we had a democracy. The word doesn’t appear in our Constitution. The only type of government it mentions is a “republican form of government.” That fits with the pledge of allegiance which says “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands…” Our republican form of government does involve citizens electing representatives to govern and it is ‘democratic’ in that sense but that hardly makes us a democracy. In fact much of the Constitution is about limiting the ability of majority and minority factions from doing whatever they want through government to ensure that they don’t attack individual rights and neglect the common good. If we actually had a democracy citizens would vote on all issues actions and laws of the government directly and the majority would always rule without regard to anyone else. There would be no governance by representatives no separation of powers no federalism no equal suffrage in the Senate no electoral college no bill of rights no checks and balances; none of these things to restrain the rule of the majority of these citizens. That’d be not much better than mob rule and it’s why our founders gave us the constitutional republic they did instead. It seems to me that it’s those people on the Left who are always criticizing these things and calling for and promising the elimination and reform of them who are the ones threatening our system of government.
