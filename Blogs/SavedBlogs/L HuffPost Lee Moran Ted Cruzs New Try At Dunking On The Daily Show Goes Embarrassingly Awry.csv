L, Ted Cruz's New Try At Dunking On 'The Daily Show' Goes Embarrassingly Awry, Lee Moran, 2021-05-08, Hostilities were renewed between “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Friday as a second beef in as many weeks broke out between them on Twitter. But the Comedy Central program ended the feud before it really got going with a retort referencing the Texas Republican’s devotion to ex-President Donald Trump. Cruz did not respond to the ding. The barbed exchange began when Cruz took exception to a mocking comment about him from Trevor Noah on Thursday’s episode of the show. “Trevor Noah is turning into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction” Cruz responded on Twitter appearing to suggest Noah was obsessed with him. Three rabbit emojis referenced that bunny boiling scene in the hit 1987 erotic psychological thriller. Trevor Noah is turning into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. 🐰🐰🐰 https://t.co/r5vDkignWy “The Daily Show” account fired back with this damning question for Cruz. Ted what's the best way to end this feud: by insulting your wife or your dad? https://t.co/SW4FxuEi43 It recalled Trump’s 2016 campaign insult about the appearance of Cruz’s wife and his promotion of a conspiracy theory that the senator’s father was somehow involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Cruz lost the 2016 Republican presidential nomination to Trump and went on to become one of his former rival’s staunchest allies.
