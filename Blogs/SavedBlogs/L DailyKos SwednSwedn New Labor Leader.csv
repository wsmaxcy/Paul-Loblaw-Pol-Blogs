L, New Labor Leader?, SwednSwedn, 2021-04-25, Mitch McConnell’s reaction to the reactions to Georgia’s Jim Crow voting laws is outright admirable. He told Big Business CEO’s to stay out of politics. Evidently he’s going to fight for abolishing Citizens United v. FEC what a surprise!  He even threatened the corporation bosses who oppose the new restrictions with ”serious consequences”. Imagine Mitch McConnell in his new job as a labor leader and unionizer – rumor has it that the republican party will enter the next election campaign under the banner ”Your New Workers’ Party”. And why not that’s how the conservative party in Sweden won the elections in 2006. You don’t believe me? Read his own words: ”I found it completely discouraging to find a bunch of corporate CEOs getting in the middle of politics.” Remember this is the leading senator of the party that relied on corporate money to cling to power for years and years. Now he’s going to join Bernie Sanders and Elisabeth Warren and AOC for ”no big business money only the thousands and thousands of small contributions from hard working individuals” never again talking about businesses being people. You still don’t believe me? To tell the truth nor do I. In Mitch McConnells party there’s no need for consistency. They just grab the first little thought that comes flying even if it’s totally contradictory to what they stand for. Look at presidential candidate Tucker Carlson talking about immigrants coming to replace his fellow whites at the same time as he and his friends repeat every anti-vaxxer hoax they can find – encouraging the audience of old right-leaning whites to die by covid-19 before they can vote for Tucker. Same way: being against some Big Business CEO’s and accepting their millions – no problem for Mitch. My cartoon this time arrives on your screen with a delay. My colleague Ronny gave me the idea right after Park Cannon’s arrest but I didn’t find time to draw the pictures until now. I post them anyway. After all the abuse Park Cannon took for a totally legal action must be remembered.
