L, 'WTF Is Wrong With You?': NRA Trashed For Tasteless Meme After Mass Shooting, Ed Mazza, 2021-05-10, Seven people were killed on Sunday in Colorado Springs Colorado in the year’s 194th mass shooting according to the nonprofit group Gun Violence Archive.  The wave of violence has led to new calls for gun control measures.  But on Sunday ― Mother’s Day ― the National Rifle Association posted a meme suggesting that mothers arm their young daughters. “MAMA DIDN’T RAISE A VICTIM” read the text over an image of a woman and a young girl with firearms. The NRA’s message and its tasteless timing came under heavy fire on Twitter:  Wtf is wrong with you?!? Happy Mother's Day to all of the grieving moms.On top of millions of other jobs moms have far to many have to take care of families destroyed by gun violence. Today my wife started Mothers Day at the cemetery visiting our daughter who was murdered in the Parkland shooting. https://t.co/2275IRARkr This is really really gross. To willingly and smilingly introduce your child to the notion of violent homicide by cutening up a machine that is designed to inflict as much damage as possible to the human body. This is abuse. https://t.co/jm2AJtMrU9 End the filibuster- defeat the NRA The @NRA is a terrorist organization. https://t.co/oiMlRmXIl5 There was another mass shooting in America today this time in #ColoradoSprings.But hey let’s use children as props. https://t.co/o21dKGg6CE Can Congress declare the NRA as a terrorist organization and get them defunded? So the NRA is saying that if something happens to women it's their own fault for not being armed.Fuck this criminal terrorist organization. #FuckTheNRA https://t.co/EnRlDyNgue Is it my imagination or are we having a couple of mass shootings every day now in the US? If the NRA was based in another country we'd be at war with it. The NRA thought that this was an appropriate thing to tweet out on Mother’s Day.7 people killed at a birthday party in Colorado Springs. https://t.co/dOBUJgV1Nd Six people were shot and killed by a gunman at a birthday party in Colorado Springs this morning - on Mother’s Day. At least 94 more people in America will be shot and killed - and over 230 will be wounded by gunfire - before the day is over. https://t.co/vo4UGw35eB
