But what if after having made one of the biggest decisions that you will make in your life you notice that the feelings of bliss that you had felt and thought were true love were not love after all? These women who watched the love or what they thought could have been love dissipate from their marriage too soon after tying the knot share how they are managing or managed the realisation and what they ultimately decided to do. 📚✒📙📒🌈 China: Lack of legal recognition of same-sex  marriage despite social acceptance and difficulties brought to forefront by a lawsuit that is causing a fury over at SCMP (22 Apr 2021) Together for 50 years a lawsuit reminds China that love and marriage are very different things The ruling came despite the judge’s acknowledgement that the couple who are surnamed Yuan and Li would be considered a couple by society’s standards just not the law’s. The case which took place in Shenyang in China’s northeastern Liaoning province between the families of the former lesbian couple has underlined legal gaps that can make it impossible for the LGBT community to find lawful recourse to disputes because same-sex marriage is illegal in China.  📙📒✒🤗🌞 Bangladesh: Occasional guest writer Sumit Basu shares personal experience of going for a walkabout in the colony (colony is purpose built neighbourhood estate residential area) in this OP-ED: Welcome to Bucolia The musings observations and revelations derived from a walk around the colony.  The functional definition of the word “religion” would have this phenomenon be a unified system of beliefs and practices with regard to sacred things meaning such things that are set apart and forbidden the beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community and includes all those who adhere to them. Thus spoke the founder of the modern discipline of sociology. And if this is a reasonably acceptable definition for a “way of life” originating from no less a person than Emile Durkheim that includes within its ambit the baffling questions of the existence and significance of human civilization then dear reader I am constrained to admit with not a little self-consciousness that I have found religion. 📚✒📙📒🌈🌏💫 Southeast Asia: Over in SCMP (24 Apr 21) a look at the progress limitations and changes in this feature article which explores  Why Southeast Asia’s LGBT community is finally coming out  Simon now 30 said he didn’t know how his friends would react to the pictures of him at the rally. He had not been open about his sexuality and felt that sharing the images on social media could suggest he was “part of that community” he said. 📚✒⌨📙📒🌏 South Asia: A column in Kathmandu Post (25 Apr 21) looking into a slightly different view of the world order part response part book critque of a recent book by Shashi Tharoor and Samir Saran titled The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative  New world disorder and South Asia ‘O brave new world that has such people in't!’ Miranda said in Shakespeare's The Tempest on first sighting the shipwrecked courtiers. Today at the end of the second decade of the 21st century most of us have a sense of it as the world is in a state of disorder. All about us is prominently chaotic. The world is ravaged to an extent by Covid-19 and the failure of governments and multilateral institutions and an attempt to see the light at the end of the tunnel may be too simplistic. With the future of humanity threatened and uncertain the ‘new world’ has failed to believe in a consensus-based approach to finding a mechanism to decode the global pandemic and creating a common task force to save humanity from suffering an unprecedented crisis consecutively in the second year. While reading The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative by Shashi Tharoor and Samir Saran one gets a very clear sense of the new world order in transition. The book prominently deals with the roots of the universal predicaments—from the inequity of the post-war international power politics to the fundamental causes of the new world’s illiberal leadership. In the South Asian region too the wind of change is well felt. Yet the authors overlook India’s growing leadership issues and rightly believe in its potential in the long run where it has a major role to play in shaping future global trends. 📒✒🦠💫 India: With the well publicized Covid-19 surge in India An editorial at Indian Express (26 Apr 2021) looking into the Covid-19 disaster in India through domestic lens  The dip and the divide that made the fight against the coronavirus purposeless  India’s premature declaration of victory against the coronavirus has proven to be counterproductive. The second wave of the pandemic has caught us unawares. The last one year of COVID-19 experience and learning has had no impact on our pandemic preparedness. Neither has our much celebrated “world’s largest vaccination programme” been effective. The Prime Minister has nothing new to say in his address to the nation. The people are leaderless. What was our leadership doing in these times of institutional collapse? The Prime Minister and home minister were preoccupied with West Bengal elections flaunting the crowds as their achievement. People have been carefree and in large numbers attended the Maha Kumbh Mela (the ruling BJP now refers to Ardh Kumbhs also as Maha Kumbh). The BJP has been promoting the myth that faith in religion is supreme. The disrespect of experts and medical sciences becomes a hallmark of society when religious events like Kumbh Mela are held without respecting Covid-19 protocols. Bollywood director Ram Gopal Varma remarked on these changing mindsets when he said that it took six weeks to vaccinate 17 lakh people in Mumbai but 35 lakhs took a dip in Ganga in just one day and wondered if we care more about next birth than this one? 📒📱🌏 India - Pakistan: some sort of fruitful diplomatic thaw between India and Pakistan seems to have been going on. Not sure how much hope to put in place given usually very antagonistic relationship between them. News over at Dawn (25 Apr 21): Indian offer led to ‘quiet’ talks on all major issues  ISLAMABAD: India appro­ached Pakistan in December 2020 with an offer to reduce tension and offered backchannel talks on all outstanding issues including Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan reciprocated favourably fresh inf­ormation emanating from official quarters has confirmed.   The Indian offer was discussed among the top Pakistan leadership and a decision was taken to explore all avenues for a peaceful settlement of conflicts by engaging in quiet talks according to high-level official sources.   India proposed that the two countries start talking on all outstanding issues side by side instead of lumping them together in a composite dialogue said the sources. The Pakistani leadership has agreed to explore all options that can lead to lowering of tension.   📚📒✒🦠🌏India - US: In the backdrop of some weird relationship between US and India (is it client state is it an ally is it a competitor is it a security risk? Likely answer is that US views India as a security risk and an explotable market/nation but Indian governmet is not aware of it.)  Over at Asia times (26 Apr 2021) an exploration of  Inconsistencies of India-US health cooperation  At a time when India is being hit most severely by the Covid-19 pandemic the United States – its strategic partner – under President Joe Biden seems to have had trouble remembering India’s goodwill toward the American public during the presidency of Donald Trump. India has become the world’s new pandemic hotspot. The South Asian country with the world’s largest vaccine-making capacity has no choice but to stop major exports of vaccines in order to meet the domestic demand. It is against this backdrop that the Indian government and vaccine makers have asked the US repeatedly to lift the restrictions on its own exports of vaccine raw materials which would greatly expedite India’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities in order to enhance its global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. 📚📒✒🌏 South Asia: Covid-19 pandemic crisis and associated difficulties around manufacturing vaccines due to IP (Intellectual Property) laws and agreements covered by WTO (World Trade Organization) agreement a timely reminder in the Dhaka Tribune (26 Apr 2021) about this IP stuff and how lack of understanding of IP stuff needs to be remedied scpecially in South Asia. IP stuff by IP lawyer OP-ED: Evaluating the intangible It is high time that we understood the value of intellectual property Over the years the movement towards a global service economy has altered the conventional concept of the value of business assets. In this new era comprising businesses focusing on providing technology-oriented services the physical assets are no longer considered the only significant part of the assets of a business. Intellectual Property (IP) being an intangible asset is very essential for an organization’s reputation. Being a distinctive creation of an organization it is generally one of the most crucial mechanisms of identifying its value thereby allowing the concerned business to be differentiated from its competitors. Businesses nowadays invest heavily in creating its IP and there are high risks that such investments may not succeed as planned unless carefully steered. It all comes down to the efficiency of businesses in assessing the potential for profit arising from the sale or licensing of its products and/or services. 📒✒⌨🌏 USA - Democracy: Over at SCMP (26 Apr 21) some thoughts about nature of American democracy by columnist Alex Lo in American democracy is a lot like Coke “[Coca-Cola] is the opiate of the running dogs of revanchist capitalism.” – Mao’s little red book “Democracy is not Coca-Cola” with the whole world having to drink from the US product quipped Foreign Minister Wang Yi explaining that all countries must follow a path of development that suits their own national conditions and the needs of their own people. Wang is probably right. But since he is thinking of American democracy and the American empire the story of the world’s most famous soft drink actually is intimately linked to both. In some sense American democracy is or was Coca-Cola. At least Mao Zedong seemed to have thought so. “Apparently some of our friends overseas have difficulty distinguishing between the United States and Coca-Cola. Perhaps we should not complain too much about this” wrote a company executive in 1950 to a colleague quoted in Mark Pendergrast’s 1993 For God Country and Coca-Cola: The Definitive History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It. 📚📙📒🌏 US - Mexico - Americas: Over at COHA (Council on Hemispheric Affairs)  David Vine presents a look at  175 Years of Border Invasions: The Anniversary of the U.S. War on Mexico and the Roots of Northward Migration  Amid renewed fear mongering about an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border this week’s 175th anniversary of the 1846–1848 war the U.S. government instigated with Mexico is a reminder that throughout U.S. history invasions have gone almost exclusively from north to south not vice versa. A near-continuous series of invasions—military political and economic—moving from north to south has helped produce the poverty violence and insecurity driving people to migrate from south to north. The current humanitarian crisis at the border with record numbers of unaccompanied minors desperately fleeing violence insecurity and poverty reveals the consequences of an interventionist policy that’s even older than the U.S.-Mexico war. To be honest interventionist is an all-too-common euphemism for imperialist invasions. The first invasion came in 1806 when U.S. military forces entered Mexican territory (then still controlled by Spain) and established a military base in today’s Colorado. In total including the 1846–1848 war that resulted in the U.S. government seizing nearly half of Mexico the U.S. military has invaded Mexico at least ten times.[1] Across Latin America U.S. forces have invaded southern neighbors more than 70 times leaving occupying armies for months years and in some cases decades.[2] Today the U.S. State Department acknowledges that U.S. troops instigated the war with Mexico.[3] In early 1846 President James Polk deployed forces into disputed territory along the Rio Grande River. “We have not one particle of right to be here” U.S. Colonel Ethan Allen Hitchcock wrote from near the river. “It looks as if the government sent a small force on purpose to bring on a war so as to have a pretext for taking California and as much of this country as it chooses.”[4] After fighting ensued Polk used what he knew to be false claims that Mexico had “invaded our territory and shed American blood on American soil” to win a Congressional declaration of war.[5] Enjoy The day Other General Open Threads That Run In Daily Kos.
