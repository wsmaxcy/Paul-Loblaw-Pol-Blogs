C, Republicans: NO CONCESSIONS In States With Voting Irregularities, Mike Frey, 2020-11-07, Why in the world would any Republican candidate concede in any of the jurisdictions with massive alleged irregularities?  If Americans want elections to go smoothly they must be beyond reproach.  At this point any concession in these locals is a selfish act to reduce tension and to “people please” or avoid media backlash not a selfless act for the country.  It helps no one and reduces the pressure to fix the problem. In fact all Republicans should STAND IN SOLIDARITY against this fraud. NO CONCESSIONS by Republicans ever to anyone.  Make every “victory” transit the entire mandated process and legal challenges. Stand your ground!
