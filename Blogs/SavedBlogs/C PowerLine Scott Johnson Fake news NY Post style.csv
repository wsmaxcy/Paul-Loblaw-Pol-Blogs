C, Fake news NY Post style, Scott Johnson, 2021-04-28, I took the New York Post cover story by Laura Italiano that ran with the tabloid headline “Kam on in” at face value. I have treated the Post as a trusted source but it turns out that this story appears to be fake news. The following correction is now appended both to Italiano’s original story and to a follow-up story by Mark Moore:  Editor’s note: The original version of this article said migrant kids were getting Harris’ book in a welcome kit but has been updated to note that only one known copy of the book was donated to a child. Italiano has resigned from the Post and reported via Twitter that she was ordered to write the story (below). The Post owes its readers an explanation that goes well beyond the editor’s note. Speaking on my own behalf to Power Line readers I regret having followed the Post down this blind alley. The Kamala Harris story — an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard enough against — was my breaking point. — Laura Italiano (@Italiano_Laura) April 27 2021   Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
