L, Minerva @ Midnight: no let up in Russian disinformation, annieliforthe End of the Republic, 2021-04-22, Not very much has changed with the disinformation being generated by the usual external players.  Russia Studied How to Get Americans to Make Mistakes...(how Americans take the Russia disinformation bait) - The Atlantic https://t.co/n5TIn3mf77 For decades now Russian security services have studied¬†a concept called ‚Äúreflexive control‚Äù‚Äîthe science of how to get your enemies to make mistakes. To be successful practitioners must first analyze their opponents deeply to understand where they get their information and why they trust it; then they need to find ways of playing with those trusted sources in order to insert errors and mistakes. This way of thinking has huge implications for the military; consider how a piece of incorrect information might get a general to make a mistake. But it works in politics too. The Russian security services have now studied us and worked out (it probably wasn‚Äôt very hard) that large numbers of Americans‚Äînot only Fox News pundits and OANN broadcasters but also members of Congress‚Äîare very happy to accept sensational information however tainted from any source that happens to provide it. As long as it suits their partisan frames and as long as it can be used against their opponents they don‚Äôt care who invented it or for what purpose. As a result supplying an edited audiotape or a piece of false evidence to one of the bottom-feeders of the information ecosystem is incredibly easy; after that others will ensure that it rises up the food chain. Russian disinformation doesn‚Äôt succeed thanks to the genius of Russians; it succeeds thanks to the sharp partisanship of Americans. Russian disinformation works because Americans allow it to work‚Äîand because those same Americans don‚Äôt care anymore about the harm they do to their country. www.theatlantic.com/...

According to the ODNI a former business assoc. of Trump campaign head Paul Manafort‚ÄîKonstantin Kilimnik‚Äîwas part of a Russian intel plot to hurt Biden & help Trump. And Manafort was secretly meeting with him through the campaign. https://t.co/ZZnANc7nF5 pic.twitter.com/EYfw2Rn3d4  The Russian state propaganda agency Sputnik is to close its Edinburgh office & Scottish operation. This is good news for what was a state disinformation operation; lets hope RT/Russia Today follows soon. https://t.co/zVYbHfXgVo  NEW: In secret Facebook groups some U.S. military elite share racist comments lies about 2020 and QAnon theories https://t.co/oks84kGpz3  This should not be surprising but it should be severely concerning to every citizen and resident of this country. We need to build a citizenry that is more resistant to such propaganda disinformation and conspiracy theories.https://t.co/v5wD6RRSpN  üì¢Take a Look | TSC Report on QAnonWhile Russia is often considered the most sophisticated external driver of disinformation China began to rapidly expand its QAnon-related disinformation campaign by March 2020. #QuantifyingQ #TSCResearchFor more ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/cBFKkSqomO pic.twitter.com/D5pT2JbAtO  5.
