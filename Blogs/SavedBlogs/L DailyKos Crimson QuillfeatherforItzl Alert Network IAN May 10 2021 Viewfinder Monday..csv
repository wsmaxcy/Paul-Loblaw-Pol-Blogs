Get to know Benjamin Banneker a pioneer in the #science of #entomology.https://t.co/o2Zrbuq0xJ From link in above tweet — - Meet Benjamin Banneker the Black Scientist Who Documented Brood X Cicadas in the Late 1700s In his 20s Banneker hand-carved a wooden clock that kept precise time cementing his status as local celebrity renowned for his mechanical skill and intellect. Per the Library of Congress he went on to study astronomy and accurately predict a 1789 solar eclipse. Opting not to marry or have children the talented polymath made his living publishing popular almanacs replete with sophisticated astronomical predictions. He also participated in a survey project that outlined the future Federal Territory of Washington D.C. SNIP “The first great Locust year that I can Remember was 1749” Banneker recalled. “I was then about Seventeen years of age when thousands of them came and was creeping up the trees and bushes I then imagined they came to eat and destroy the fruit of the Earth and would occasion a famine in the land. I therefore began to kill and destroy them but soon saw that my labor was in vain therefore gave over my pretension.” He went on to describe the cicada events of 1766 and 1783 which he also witnessed and venture a suggestion that “their periodical return is Seventeen years but they like the Comets make but a short stay with us.” Banneker then (accurately) predicted that the cicadas would once again return that very same year. .
