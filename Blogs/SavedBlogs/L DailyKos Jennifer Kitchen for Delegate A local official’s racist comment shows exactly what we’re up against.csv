L, A local official’s racist comment shows exactly what we’re up against, Jennifer Kitchen for Delegate, 2021-06-29, Sometimes in life you have to call it like you see it. So when I heard that a local official here in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley had made a grotesquely racist comment during a Board of Supervisors meeting I had to say something.  Here’s what happened: At last week’s Augusta County Board of Supervisors meeting Chairman Gerald W. Garber “joked” that a former Board member should be "dressed up as a monkey” after he agreed with public commenters (who were predominantly Black) on the necessity of police body cams. This is very disturbing.    At a minimum we deserve an explanation: what was Garber’s intent when he made this comment? But more than that we must hold our elected officials accountable and let them know we expect better. This level of callous disrespect of constituents has no place in government.  Not only do I condemn Garber’s comments in the strongest possible terms I am publicly asking for all officials involved to apologize for their actions and even more importantly consider whether they’re really up to the task of governing when they clearly hold the folks they’re representing in contempt.   The people I know in Augusta County are fed up with this sort of behavior and we’re not going to take it any more. And that my friends is exactly why we will win here.
