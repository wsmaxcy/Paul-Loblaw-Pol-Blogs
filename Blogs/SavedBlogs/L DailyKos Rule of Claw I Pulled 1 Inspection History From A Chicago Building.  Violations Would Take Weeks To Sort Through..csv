L, I Pulled 1 Inspection History From A Chicago Building.  Violations Would Take Weeks To Sort Through., Rule of Claw, 2021-07-01, This is not a coastal building obviously.  But I wanted to go through this exercise for two reasons-1.  I wanted to show you just how common violations are.  2.  I wanted to show you violations from a high profile bulding owned by a deep pocketed corporation not a group of tenants responsbile for the out of pocket repair costs. The numbers of failures violations repairs re-inspections just in the past ten years are in the 100’s.  Over time..thousands.  And Chicago does a great fantastic thank-God-for-big-government job catching them cataloguing them and making them easily searchable. Also the construction of this building and Champlain are two completely different animals.  But this post is going to show how vital the inspection and code enforcement process is to any building.  It is not to suggest the relative strengths and weaknesses of one building versus another.  It is not to compare safety or to discuss similarities of which there are few if any. This is showing you that just one random building has a massive history of errors of fixes of failures of passes and the potential consequences if any one of the slender threads of good governance fails. What I am about to post is not designed to shame the building or their owners-in fact in some ways the history that shows the timeliness of the responses and work is actually a credit to them.  I do not want to make a claim that anyone here did anything wrong at all.  It is a large building some things happen they get found they get fixed.  That is all they or anyone realistically should ask. Nevertheless-here is a sample in this case from this past March.  Then below from 2018.   Failed to maintain electric elevator equipment provided at premises in safe and sound working condition. (13-196-590 13-196-630(b) 18-30-001)  Now that we have a sample of the thousands literally of code enforcement notations let’s learn a bit more about the building.  People live in the (building.)  That seems elementary to many people but I’m continually surprised by the number of people I run into—even people who are from Chicago—who think it’s strictly an office building.  When the building opened it had 720 residences.  Over time people bought out their neighbors to make their homes larger and now the total  is around 702.  Which means statistically speaking there are 1825.2 people way up there. That is roughly ten times more than lived in the Champlain Towers South. Now I should note there is nothing not one thing suggesting in this post that the building is in any danger whatsoever.  As I noted this is simply to show you the delicate tedious process of maintaining a building and keeping a building safe.  And as you will read in the process of caulking or construction accidents happen- Three people died and at least eight others were injured Saturday afternoon when part of a 25-foot aluminum scaffold fell in high winds from the 43rd floor of the (building) onto Chestnut Street flattening three cars. As hundreds of frightened pedestrians ran for cover the remaining scaffolding banged repeatedly into the building's south side shattering dozens of windows and sending shards of glass and other debris raining onto North Michigan Avenue and nearby streets.  Three women were killed in the incident two in their 20s and one in her 30s said a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office. Fire Commissioner James Joyce said all three had been occupants of damaged cars but police spokesman Pat Camden could not confirm that. City ordinance-A city ordinance requires scaffolds to be locked in position when not in use but it was not clear if that ordinance had been violated Saturday said city Building Department spokeswoman Kristen Cabanban. See-that big government again requiring buildings and their owners to be extra super duper careful with sugar on top to make sure bystanders don’t get crushed to death. We all have our phobias.  Mine is elevators so out of the thousands of notes I could sort through I chose that subject.  It was not with reason- An elevator inside Chicago's (building) dropped 84 floors before trapping six people inside local news outlets reported. Rescuers arrived shortly after the fall early Friday morning to cut a hole in the building's wall and free those inside. The accident unfolded at (redacted) the Chicago Tribune reported. Guests entered the elevator after leaving building's Signature Room — a bar with stunning views of downtown from the 95th floor — before at least one cables holding the car broke. A sudden "clack clack clack" noise occurred passenger Jaime Montemayor 50 told the Tribune before dust began seeping into the car. Those aboard screamed prayed and cried the newspaper reported. Now this is not to claim that the building operators/owners are villains.  Things do happen despite our best intentions.  This is why we have lawyers and insurance and do our best.  And I found nothing to suggest that anyone involved in the operation of this building were not trying. But for now let’s get back to the cost of just one mistake- On the eve of trial 10 victims of those injured and killed by the scaffolding that collapsed and fell from the (Building) in Chicago will receive $75 million in a global settlement for their personal injury and wrongful death claims. “Had daily weather reports fundamental safety practices and mere common sense been followed this catastrophe could have been avoided” said Demetrio. “The real tragedy is that the responsible parties knew that the equipment was poorly engineered and nevertheless allowed it to hang from the 42nd floor after a wind advisory had been issued by the National Weather Service. “Throughout the window sealing project these defendants chose to implement cost-cutting and time-saving measures. Their actions cost people their lives by allowing the 10000 pounds of equipment to remain inadequately secured at a midpoint of the building. This careless conduct was compounded when tenants reported to the proper building officials the loose scaffolding banging in the near record winds. However instead of immediately closing off the street below on a busy Saturday morning filled with shoppers they chose to do nothing.” But see these things are rare no cause for concern as the odds of it happening are miniscule and “a lot of people are saying” Chicago building inspectors are part-time proctologists right? replied over 7 years ago @Marcin G. I have no experience in cook county I imagine that dealing with Chicago building inspectors must be akin to a 3 month long colonoscopy. Good luck.  This attitude towards code enforcement so much other indispensible government is the attitude of a person posting on a site called literally “BiggerPockets.com” who thinks all the blah blah of code enforcers is just designed to fatten city coffers at the expense of the success of a patriotic bootstraps contractor.  It isn’t like that one iota.  These city professionals do their jobs daily so that they don’t fail and give city coroners more work.  They care. People like to ignore.  They like to ignore need they like to ignore truth and they love to ignore rules. Some rules are annoying some are expensive but most are designed to teach and protect. This building as most of those reading I suspect have already guessed is known as the John Hancock Center. 1128 feet tall at any given point and time housing thousands of workers tourists and residents.  And I gave you a sample of just how detailed the work is how hard it is to maintain and the consequences of even just one mistake. Now imagine for a minute Florida.  We know its reputation.  We know its politics.  And we also know this- The data collected from 1993 to 1999 showed that most of the Miami area was not sinking appreciably save for a few hot spots. Wdowinski said most of those occurred in the western part of Miami where the elevation is lower. The level of sinking at the Champlain condo was unusual he said. One could surmise that a whole lot of the coast was built according to the same standards as Champlain.  And if it is proven to be a maintenance not construction issue that may be ok.  And consider this though two entirely different buildings in entirely different geographic areas to Chicago’s advantage and despite trying the John Hancock Center still struggled at times to avoid issues.  And it is plainly clear that they were doing their best. What happens if it is uncovered that many of these fancy condos were just as mistake prone?  Where do those tens of thousands go?  You know at some point cans have to stopped being kicked down the road lest we find our people of the future standing on the can’s balcony. And then we must hope that at that point we do not learn the merciless lesson of gravity through the falling of our children. -ROC Hey friends my cancer fight has turned more serious and has forced me to urgently change careers!  And-huge news!  My newsletter is live! Sign up here to subscribe!  It publishes every Wednesday and will be full of original reporting laughs and fun!
