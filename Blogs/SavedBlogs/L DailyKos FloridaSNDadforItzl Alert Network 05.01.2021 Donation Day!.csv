L, 05.01.2021 "Donation Day!", FloridaSNDadforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-30,  As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos. If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we are going to check up on you. If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here. We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries. Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime! We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! Monday Crimson Quillfeather Tuesday ejoanna Wednesday Pam from Calif Thursday art ah zen Friday FloridaSNMOM Saturday FloridaSNDad Sunday loggersbrat  Hello!  and happy Saturday to all my Dkos family.  First off… let me assure you all that I have felt far better this week than i did this time last week. And second apparently Thursday was Donation day!  Let me Explain.  Every six months to a year one of our closest friends here in town goes through his closet and brings by a load of clothes which he no longer has use for.  This means that yesterday We got a large box full of clothes that contained a little something for each of us!  Which in my case means i have a pair of shorts and several new t-shirts which are things that I did not order when our last stim checks came in.  In fact I do not think I have worn a pair of shorts in -years-.  So this is going to be somewhat new to me.
