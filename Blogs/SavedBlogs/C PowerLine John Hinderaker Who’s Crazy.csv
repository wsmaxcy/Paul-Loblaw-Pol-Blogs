C, Who’s Crazy?, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-06, Democrats are busily trying to portray Republicans as crazy extremists and conspiracy theorists. Marjorie Greene is the latest target of this campaign and of course the Dems continue to milk the January 6 D.C. mini-riot for all it is worth and more. (Meanwhile they have no interest in what would seem to be the real story the inexplicable breakdown of security at the Capitol. And contrary to the Democrats’ usual practice the identity of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman Ashli Babbitt is a closely guarded secret.) But where do we look for maximum craziness? How about Maxine Waters who says that President Trump “should be charged with premeditated murder” (of whom?) because he was involved in “advance planning about the invasion” at the Capitol. Talk about a conspiracy theory! But Waters’ claims aren’t much crazier than those of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who asserted that Ted Cruz was trying to get her killed.  There was a time when making such reckless extreme and–to say the least!–unsupported claims about one’s political opponents would have been considered far out of bounds by pretty much everyone. No longer. When is the last time you have seen a Democratic politician–any politician–denounce even the most hateful and potentially violence-producing rhetoric from a fellow Democrat? I can’t think of a single instance. There is a spirit of insanity abroad in the land but if the Democrats want to see its principal manifestations they need to look in the mirror. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
