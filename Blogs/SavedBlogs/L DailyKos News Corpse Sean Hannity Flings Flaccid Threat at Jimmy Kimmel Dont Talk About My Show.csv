L, Sean Hannity Flings Flaccid Threat at Jimmy Kimmel: 'Don't Talk About My Show', News Corpse, 2021-05-11, The violent insurrection advocates and malicious anti-vaxxers at Fox News have been working overtime to frighten the American people on behalf of the former reality TV game show host and twice-impeached loser Donald Trump whom they have coronated as their lord and savior. But they have to take some time off every now and then to bask in their own narcissistic outrage and victimhood. On Monday Sean Hannity took the opportunity to lash out against a late night talk show comedian who according to Hannity was "spewing hatred and rage" He thinks that's what comedians do because his only role model is Fox's terminally unfunny Greg Gutfeld. Hannity was appalled that Jimmy Kimmel had the temerity to poke fun at his interview with Caitlyn Jenner. In Kimmel's monologue (video below) he mocked Jenner's callous commentary about the homeless in California noting that a neighbor of his was moving to Arizona so he wouldn't have to "walk down the streets and see the homeless." Well that was just too much for Hannity who unloaded this unhinged rant (The video wouldn’t load on dKos but you can watch it here): "By the way don’t you have anything better to do? Maybe actually trying to be funny or boost your dismal ratings because we’re absolutely crushing you by like 70% in total viewers. That's this quarter. Jimmy here’s my advice don’t talk about my show anymore. [...] You talk about my show I’ll hit you back 50 times harder." [Later adding that...] "We had a little spat back in the day. And if he wants me to remind his bosses at Disney of all the crap that he’s done over the years that frankly are pretty ignorant to use his words I’ll be glad to pick that fight. I’d advise him not to talk about me anymore. That’s my advice. Late night as we once knew it is dead." First of all Hannity's idea of what "talking about the real problem of homelessness" is consists of two sentences about a wealthy man who was driven from California by just the sight of poor people. But then Hannity got to the core issue which was his hurt feelings at having been the butt of Kimmel's jokes. So naturally Hannity threatens Kimmel with a threat so impotent it couldn't hold up a feather. Does Hannity think that the Disney executives are unaware of the ancient bits that Kimmel did long ago? Does he really think that bringing those up is hitting back "50 times harder"? And what is his point about the ratings? Anyone who is knowledgeable about television knows that you can't compare primetime numbers to late night. Hannity is competing in a contest for which is pitifully unprepared. If Kimmel chooses to take up this challenge you can rest assured that Hannity will end up toasted beyond recognition. So in addition to provoking a fight over an issue that Hannity can't defend he's also setting himself up for an epic ass-whooping. and this is what passes for "news" on the Fox network.
