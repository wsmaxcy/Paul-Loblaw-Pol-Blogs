L, New Covid Surge Is Threatening Young People This Time, Susie Madrak, 2021-03-29, CNN's John Avlon talked about the newest coronavirus surge and how it's affecting young people this time. "New cases are on the rise in 27 states. In Michigan they've seen an increase of more than 50% since last week alone. The state's lead health officials says Michigan is in the throes of a new surge and cases are increasing the most with younger people. Miguel Marquez is live in Detroit" Avlon said. "Look this is the race between the variants and the vaccines. What they are concerned about is not only a more transmissible variant which you're already seeing but a more deadly one. They're seeing cases here in Michigan and in other states rise mostly among young people. Here in Michigan it's the 10 to 19 cohort where they're seeing the numbers rise the most. They say it's a community spread and they're trying to do everything they can. Fears growing across the country just as the new variant identified in the U.K. is becoming the dominant strain here in the U.S." Marquez said. "In Michigan new cases have been steadily rising all month. The chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services Dr. Joni Calhoun says cases are rising among people and the state has identified 1200 variants of those first seen from the U.K." "In Florida spring breakers have flooded the break and it's seeing an uptick of cases in young people in at least one county. The state has reported a seven-day average of 5100 up 12% from two weeks earlier. Florida has the most confirmed cases of the U.K. variant in the country"  For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
