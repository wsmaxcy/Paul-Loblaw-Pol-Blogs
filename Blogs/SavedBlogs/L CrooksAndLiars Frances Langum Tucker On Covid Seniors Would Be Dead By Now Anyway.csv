L, Tucker On Covid: Seniors Would Be Dead By Now Anyway, Frances Langum, 2021-07-07, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  I still think Tucker Carlson has a bet with someone as to how far he can go before he's fired.   On Tuesday night's Tucker Tonight the host decided to compare the age of victims of Covid-19 to their life expectancy.  Apparently in the death lottery anyone who outlives the life expectancy number is living on stolen or at least borrowed time and should be happy they got to die of something other than old age. Me?  I'm old enough to remember when "death panels" and "killing grandma" were right-wing arguments against the Affordable Care Act.   Yes making sure everyone is vaccinated against a disease that can kill you is a logical step not a hype.  It's why we require seatbelts and warning labels on household cleaning items.    Seriously Tucker is going full death panels here suggesting that seniors have lived long enough if they surpass the "average life expectancy" and we shouldn't "stop Western civilization" to save them.   Let's make THAT a campaign issue in 2022 shall we?  It’s okay when old people die says Tucker to an audience predominantly comprised of old people. — Eubie Fronten (@Hubert_Fronten3) July 7 2021 Should we notify our grandparents when they've passed their life expectancy so they can go walk in traffic? — Jamie Lawson (@shelbymustang) July 7 2021 Dear @TuckerCarlson: Why do you hate older Americans? https://t.co/tyvBHOZGLV — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) July 7 2021 Jesus. 600000 people died. Who the fuck cares how old they were?They were someone’s parents grandparents auntie uncle sister brother. Now there’s an empty seat at the table at holidays where they used to sit. So no covid was NOT overhyped Tucker McNear Swanson Carlson https://t.co/nh6otarju7 — Karoli (@Karoli) July 7 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
