L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 6/29/2021: Bridge Club, belinda ridgewoodforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-06-29,  Good evening Kibitzers!  At the time I’m writing this I’m still looking at another 24 hours of “excessive heat warning” from the National Weather Service followed by heavy rain (for extra steam!) but hot and humid as it’s been it’s only hitting 95° or so. If it were cooling off at night it would almost be tolerable. [It is not; I checked at 4 am and it was still 82°.] I’m embarrassed to complain because the Pacific Northwest has been having a much worse event hopefully settling down by the time this diary posts. Their daytime high temps have been ones I associate with an ill-advised visit to Phoenix in July. I hope everyone east and west will soon be safely out the other side for a while.  From time to time I pander blatantly to one or another of you with these diaries. side pocket gets a Dire Straits diary or I try to appeal to Chrislove with drag queen cooking videos that sort of thing. So today eeff gets a diary prominently featuring the I-40 “Hernando de Soto” bridge that (so far) connects Memphis with Arkansas across the Mississippi River. I know he’s shown a strong interest in how that damage came about and what they’re going to do about it and my friend I think I have just the video for you. And I might just pander to one or two other KTKers while I’m at it. I like this guy Grady Hillhouse who is behind the YouTube channel Practical Engineering. The channel discusses civil engineering topics in a way that is non-technical enough for me a simple American Studies major but still reminds me of how my dad would lay out something like this at a level I could get yet not dumbing it down so far as to be inaccurate. There are many things about the present time I’m glad he’s not seeing but I’m sorry he missed these videos — he’d have enjoyed them. What Really Happened at the Hernando de Soto Bridge?   [12:54] If you’d like to think about suspension bridges instead he offers one on the famous failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge that gives a little more detail than most.   [8:47] But the infrastructure discussed on this channel is not limited to bridges. Here’s one on a subject I know commanded a lot of attention here: What Really Happened at the Oroville Dam Spillway?   [18:26] Finally for now: this March Grady was moved to make what he called the channel’s first current-events video on the Texas power-grid failure that he himself in San Antonio had a front-row seat for.   [16:47] The channel has more videos that unravel disasters but it also has plenty that explain bits of technology (and the flaws thereof) — storm surge potholes reinforced concrete traffic lights and many others. If you like to find out how things work you might find something interesting there. Today’s Political and Other Short Subjects: The Meidas Touch highlights a Brian Williams segment featuring video they shot at the recent Trump rally — seems a lot of fans did that “leave at the 7th inning stretch to beat traffic” thing.   [1:33] This video is good news for fans of the Ricciardis — we had heard Mr. R. was very ill but here they are looking good with a parody they created for the Washington Post “Style Invitational”.   [2:45] brittlestar; this is short and kind of sweet.   [0:58] Moar music! Garfunkel & Oates explore the world of “bipartisan” humor.   [5:25] I missed this Trae Crowder from a couple of weeks ago back when Louie Gohmert was inquiring into changing the earth’s orbit. I realize Gohmert is not really a laughing matter but sometimes you just need to mock.   [1:25] Just for a little perspective this video from The Onion about a rather dull conspiracy theorist is from 2013.   [1:27] I had to watch this all the way through to make sure I shouldn’t draw any bad conclusions from the use of Green Day’s Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) as soundtrack. Nope just one of the many folks who gloss over the “Good Riddance” part and find it a great graduation song and perfect for this application. These certainly are excellent Obama slides including many of the top “little kid” ones.   [2:34]  Stay safe!  💙💙💙💙💙 The Democracy Docket website founded by formidable our-side attorney Marc Elias carries breaking news about current election law more in-depth articles and always information plus all available legal documents (as PDFs) about every active election law case.

We have come to the point where Chef José Andrés’ worldwide relief organization is so ubiquitous that I’m just giving it its own box here. I can’t even link all the places they’re working. They’re feeding people who need meals wherever they find them for whatever reason and by whatever means including supporting local restaurants by contracting with them for meals.

As federal money has begun to flow so many problems have built up due to various natural disasters drought Covid as a pandemic and with its economic impacts it’s not the case that a big pile of cash is just going to fix everything there. At the root of the problem is racism; what a surprise. It’s easy for wealthy colonizers to loot a place when there aren’t many people who care what happens there. It’s… kind of a pattern. Since no one can snap their fingers and declare the problem solved this box is now tracking reports from Denise Oliver-Velez. To learn more about what’s going on there her Twitter feed and Daily Kos comments are good starting points. 1375 days post Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Biden Administration Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona @SecCardona announced Puerto Rico will receive nearly $4 billion in sorely needed federal education pandemic relief funds.

The CDC’s guidance page for mask wearing. And now new guidance for fully-vaccinated people. The previous chart was perhaps more useful; the new one just shows no masking at all on the vaccinated side.

More about the Delta variant (also called B.1.617.2) in this unrolled Twitter thread from Bob Wachter chair of the UC San Francisco Dept of Medicine. So that’s two votes for “time to worry” especially about the unvaccinated. (Context: last week’s It’s Time to Worry About the Delta Variant.) Three strikes for Delta as this unrolled Twitter thread from epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding describes how meticulous contact tracing in New South Wales Australia has shown Delta spreads through MUCH more casual and fleeting contact than we’re accustomed to. This looks like “time to worry A LOT”. [Original Twitter thread.] NEW: A Vox video about Covid variants how they come to be and why they’re showing up now. SciShow Covid playlist here. The Atlantic has listed their ongoing virus coverage here and none is behind a paywall. They add new articles often including these two: The Only Way We’ll Know When We Need COVID-19 Boosters and The Dos and Don’ts of Hot Vax Summer. I’m not listing this Atlantic article above because I don’t see it on their virus coverage list so it may be paywalled.
