C, The Week in Pictures: Peak Stupidity Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-06, So this is the week we learned that New York women aren’t into Cuomosexuality. And I was sure on Monday that this story would supply our theme for the week’s picture gallery. I underestimated the potentiality of Dr. Seuss. I didn’t think you could get lower than neutering Mr. Potato Head into Zir. Potatx. Stand by: I predict Peanuts will be up for cancellation next week. Written by a guy named Schultz—the most famous Nazi prison camp guard name ever. And don’t even get started on mis-gendering Peppermint Patty. Meanwhile did you notice that we got an upgrade from Prez. Biden this week from “Deplorable” to “Neanderthal.” If we try really hard we can make “cave man” by the end of the month!            The Babylon Bee naturally:     Another racist teacher.                                                     Headlines of the week:                                           This apparently is authentic. And totally awesome.       Talk about a happy place! (Must be in Texas.) Now for me this would be about the new DJI drone. (Which I have in fact ordered.)   And finally. . .  (This is total NM bait. You know who you are out there!) Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
