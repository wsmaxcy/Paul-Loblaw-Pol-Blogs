C, Dayam--What an Ad., BTCG, 2020-09-25, Every once in a while a politicial ad comes along that is so out of the ordinary that you spread it around to everyone you know.  I ran across such an ad this morning.  Take four minutes from your life and watch.  Hey 1.3m views since 1630 yesterday is pretty damned good. This ad OMG pic.twitter.com/1V18ErCb83 — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) September 24 2020  The production values the trailer-for-movie qualities even the bit of humor in the middle all of it is made for its audience: the larger than life ethos of Texas.  I’m not certain who made this video but I would not be surprised if it turned out to be a military veteran. It didn’t take very long at all to find such a group of people.  Veterans in Media and Entertainment has a page of Facebook to promote the hiring of vets in productions.  NOTE: I just know the name not their politics.  But I would bet that a lot of them know a good filmmaker who would have no problem being an Alan Smithee (or other protective pseudonym) on a project like a conservative political ad.  And it hires a vet. So campaigns out there: why not get a twofer?  Hire a vet for your next ad and let their buddy vet be the writer.  You might have the next kick-ass viral ad.  Couldn’t hurt.
