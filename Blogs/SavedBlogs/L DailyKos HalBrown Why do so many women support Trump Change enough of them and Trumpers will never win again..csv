L, Why do so many women support Trump? Change enough of them and Trumpers will never win again., HalBrown, 2021-05-01,  If you look up  why women support Trump up on DuckDuckGo you will find many articles addressing the reason why this pussy grabbing misogynist has so many female supporters. They go back to 2016. An Oct 20202 column in DC Report offers this explanation: However one defines it a majority of white women voted for Trump to protect what they have – status income tax advantage whatever – despite Trump’s anti-woman attitudes and record. This is from “Of Course White Women Voted for Trump Again.” One of the most notable trends to emerge from the 2016 presidential election was the large number of white women who helped solidify Donald Trump’s victory. Many of them lived in suburbs and their support for a grab-’em-by-the-pussy candidate despite his sexist racist and derogatory behavior on the campaign trail was a dark reminder that some women were still more interested in protecting their privilege than fighting for equality. The psychological reasons women can support an man who degrades women objectifies them and sees them as inferior to men has to do with the ability of all people to engage in compartmentalization denialism and rationalization  Compartmentalization is a subconscious psychological defense mechanism used to avoid cognitive dissonance or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person having conflicting values cognitions emotions beliefs etc. within themselves. Wikipedia Denialism is a person's choice to deny reality as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth. Denialism is an essentially irrational action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event when a person refuses to accept an empirically verifiable reality. Wikipedia Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which controversial behaviors or feelings are justified and explained in a seemingly rational or logical manner to avoid the true explanation and are made consciously tolerable—or even admirable and superior—by plausible means. Wikipedia Going deeper psychologically some of these women probably have impaired self-esteem and accept their role as being subservient to men and being dominated by them. Getting enough women to stop viewing Trump’s endorsement as if they are a Devine ordination would also mean they would have to admit they were wrong that they were deceived essentially that they fell for a con. This is obviously a difficult thing to do. If Democrats and never-Trump Republicans could figure out a way to peel even a small percentage of the females who both support Trump and those who will run on his coattails in 2022 and if he decides not to run again in the next presidential election they won’t stand a chance of winning. Perhaps you can share your ideas here.
