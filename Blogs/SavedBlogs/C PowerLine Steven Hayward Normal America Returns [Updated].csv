C, Normal America Returns [Updated], Steven Hayward, 2021-07-04, Last year in the small rural town where I’m temporarily residing while the COVID-delayed major renovations on my house get started the town “officially” canceled the July 4 parade but the town mostly ignored officialdom and held a spontaneous parade anyway mostly without masks. This year’s parade was more than “back to normal” with a huge crowd and lots of great small-town spirit.  I made a short highlight reel:  Meanwhile some of you have been asking when I might post a new train video. Well here’s some raw footage I shot with my new FPV drone in super fast “sport” mode and I’m not totally happy with it but it was nerve wracking to fly under a bridge and power lines not to mention a narrow ravine for the first time.  UPDATE—Well what do you know? Here’s the early evening view of some of the many *unofficial* fireworks shows going on around this small rural burgh. ‘Murica!  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
