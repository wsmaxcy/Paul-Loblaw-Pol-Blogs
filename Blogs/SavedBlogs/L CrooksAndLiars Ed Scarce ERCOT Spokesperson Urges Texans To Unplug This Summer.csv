"We're just urging Texans to make small sacrifices no blood or anything like that." She then asked Texans "would you rather have A/C or AOC? Think about that for a little bit and it will start to make sense." So popular was her clip that for awhile last night #A/C or AOC was trending on Twitter. Brian Williams closed his show with her clip. Source: MEAWW Comedian Blaire Erskine is winning hearts yet again after her latest hilarious video. This time Erskine mixed an important public message in with her comedy urging Texans to preserve electricity and help save the power grid. She even had an 'ERCOT spokesperson' tag on the video much to some people's delight and other's concerns.  As summer approaches there is concern that Texas' power grid run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) will be unable to cope with the spike in demand. Those concerns were already seen last winter when millions of Texans were left freezing after the power grid went down. The lack of power led to numerous deaths with many families suing ERCOT. Eventually Governor Greg Abbott ordered an investigation after the massive failure left the state red-faced.  "We gotta take care of it (the power grid) or its gonna go bust" she opened. "We can't be having that it'll be a mess." Erskine is heard saying in the video "we're just asking the people of Texas to make small sacrifices no blood or anything like that." She then asked Texans "would you rather have AC or AOC? Think about that for a little bit and it will start to make sense." Erskine concluded by urging Texans to unplug when possible saying "If you don't unplug God's gonna find a way to make you unplug." She then joked "In this scenario we are God." While detailing Texas' power grid woes from the ironically named ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) with more calls for turning off the A/C lest the power grid suffer catastrophic failure MSNBC's Brian Williams took time to include a shout out to Blaire Erskine.  "Sadly a ton of people tonight thought that was real" concluded Williams.
