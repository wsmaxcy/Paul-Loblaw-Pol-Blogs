L, Why Do Republicans Romanticize White Supremacy?, Michael Rode , 2021-04-28, The Republicans’ obsession with white supremacy is not hidden from anyone but they deny the existence of white privilege in America and think that it is white people who face most discrimination. The January 2021 storming of the Capitol by Republican rioters was all about maintaining white power in the US. White supremacist terrorism was labelled an act of ”patriotism” by Republican Senator Johnson. He made a bizarre statement about BLM and said he never felt threatened when thousands of rioters stormed the Capitol as those were “law abiding” citizens who loved this country but would feel scared if the mob had been Black Lives Matter or Antifa protestors. Johnson spilled his bigoted thoughts without any hesitation but this is what Republicans are all about. The statement was both white supremacist and racist in nature. Romanticizing white supremacy can be more harmful than you think we live in a time when we are witnessing too many race related crimes in America. Since March 2020 there is a disturbing rise in attacks on Asian Americans and white people are the main perpetrators. This is something which can really harm America’s global reputation. I am sure except for republicans no one wants an America where people with different race or ethnicity do not feel safe. Donald Trump had the biggest hand in promoting white supremacy in the US he always relied on racism and stoking fear to win or gain power. In August 2017 a young woman died protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville Virginia. Trump told reporters “I think there is blame on both sides.” and then continued to make an awful statement “But you also had very fine people on both sides.” Now this is what you call white privilege and we must eradicate it. White Supremacy has many dangerous consequences that Republicans do not fear and in fact they rely on it to strengthen their political stance in America. They have a long history of discrimination against Black Americans immigrants and more recently gays and lesbians. They want to prevent these groups from enjoying same civil liberties and rights. But we must resist this ideology and make sure every citizen has equal rights and opportunities because this is what makes America great. Please think about how you can help eradicate white supremacy and root out systematic racism from every part of America.
