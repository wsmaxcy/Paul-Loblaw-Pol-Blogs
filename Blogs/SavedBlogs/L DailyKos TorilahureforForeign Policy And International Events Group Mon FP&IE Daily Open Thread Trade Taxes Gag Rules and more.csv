India Covid Live Update. A continously updated collection of articles as and when they appear.   📚✒📙📒🌏 Sri Lanka - China - India: An article exploring the relationship history and current status by Umesh Moramudali in The Diplomat (01 May 2021) The Economics of the China-India-Sri Lanka Triangle  Sri Lanka’s relationship with China has been a controversial discussion during the last decade dominating both domestic and international political conversations. The strengthening relationship between the island nation and the emerging global power has been largely economic. Yet it is quite clear that Sri  Lanka’s closest neighbor India and the United States are diligently monitoring these developments in the China-Sri Lanka relationship. China has been a major economic partner for Sri Lanka. Beijing’s assistance has been crucial in saving the poorly performing Sri Lankan economy during the last three years. At the same time Sri Lanka is compelled not to antagonize India the closest neighbor of the island with which Sri Lanka’s relationship runs deep and far back. The India-Sri Lanka relationship is vastly different than its ties with China. 📙📱🌏 Russia - France: Over at Modern Diplomacy (03 May 2021) Kester Ken Klomegah has this cover of from the latest Russian overture to in France Russia and France to strengthen economic cooperation On April 29 Russian President Vladimir Putin held videoconference with leaders of several French companies-members of the Franco-Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI France-Russia) to discuss some aspects of Russian-French trade economic and investment cooperation including the implementation of large joint projects as well as the prospects for collaborative work. Putin noted that the Economic Council of the Franco-Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is still operational in spite of difficulties and the late April meeting was the fourth time since 2016. From the historical records France has been and remains a key economic partner for Russia holding a high but not sufficiently high 6th place among EU countries in the amount of accumulated investment in the Russian economy and 5th place in the volume of trade. Despite a certain decline in mutual trade in 2020 (it went down by 14 percent compared to 2019) the ultimate figure is quite acceptable at $13 billion. French investment in Russia is hovering around $17 billion while Russian investment in France is $3 billion. 📚✒⌨📙📒🌏 US - Policy - (Pakistan):  Betsy Joles has filing at Foreign Policy (2 May 2021) a look at how anti-abortion influences US policy and presents an example of its unusual consequences far way with Pakistan as an example The Global Gag Rule’s Long Shadow in Pakistan PUNJAB and SINDH PROVINCES Pakistan—On a Saturday in February four women came to a reproductive health clinic in Rawalpindi Pakistan seeking to end their pregnancies. Three of the four were married mothers who already had multiple children like many women receiving abortion care in Pakistan. When Naseem Tariq a doctor at the clinic lifted one client’s shirt to take an ultrasound the stretch marks from her last baby were still visible. Tariq sees patients with unintended pregnancies almost every day. After each consultation she tells women about their family planning options. Most patients don’t have access to any long-term birth control method often because husbands or mothers-in-law don’t allow it or because they can’t easily afford it. Just 34 percent of married Pakistani women use contraception and only 25 percent rely on modern methods based on the latest state-supported survey. “They are poor. They have seven to eight kids. The access to family planning services is not there” Tariq said. “What comes out of this? Unwanted pregnancies.” Despite abortion only being legal in Pakistan under certain conditions the country has one of the highest abortion rates in the world—an estimated 50 abortions per 1000 women according to 2012 research by the Population Council one of the most comprehensive reports on the topic. This makes health organizations in Pakistan particularly vulnerable to funding restrictions that target abortion. Family planning initiatives in Pakistan suffered under the Trump administration which reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy to ban recipients of U.S. assistance for global health from providing abortions counseling women about abortions or giving referrals for abortion services—even with their own private funds. 📚✒📙📒🌏 Indonesia: Over at SCMP a piece by Ardhitya Eduard Yeremia and Klaus Heinrich Raditio exploring and explaining why Indonesia’s vaccine cooperation with Beijing won’t compromise Unclos commitment in South China Sea Last December the first 1.2 million Sinovac shots arrived in Jakarta Indonesia’s capital city. The timing could not have been more perfect as Indonesia was entering the ninth month of the pandemic and its daily reported positive cases had soared beyond 4000 since the end of September. “Alhamdulillah the vaccine is available which means that we can immediately prevent the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak” President Joko Widodo said. Kompas a leading national newspaper further praised cooperation as a “victory of [Indonesia’s] diplomacy”. Indonesia had started to receive the vaccines while “100 other countries have not yet secured access to vaccines”. 📙📒📱 Colombia: Even though former president was calling for army and police to supress the protests against tax hikes (MercoPress (01 may 2021): Former President Uribe calls on police and army to use weapons in Colombian protests Colombian former President Álvaro Uribe on Friday urged that police and military have the right to use arms in the context of demonstrations against the tax reform being promoted by the government of Ivan Duque his political godson. The following reactions included Human Rights groups and political figures pressing Twitter to suspend Uribe’s account where he posted the message. “Let us support the right of soldiers and police to use their weapons to defend their integrity and to defend people and property from the criminal action of vandalism terrorism” the former president wrote on Friday morning two days after the national strike called by workers' centres and student organisations. His message on Twitter was deleted hours later for failing to comply with his policies “regarding the glorification of violence” and has been interpreted by the opposition as an incitement to violence. “In a state governed by the rule of law a vandal and a criminal also have rights including due process and the proportional use of force. They are caught and prosecuted not shot” reacted Luis Ernesto Gómez the government secretary of left-wing Claudia López's mayor's office in the capital Bogotá. However the current government has decided to shelve the tax plans from Al Jazeera (02 May 2021)  Colombia’s president withdrawing tax reforms after mass protests Colombian President Ivan Duque has said he is withdrawing a contentious tax reform proposal after thousands of protesters took to the streets across the South American nation for several days to denounce the measures. In a video on Sunday Duque said he would ask Congress “to withdraw the law proposed by the finance ministry and urgently process a new law that is the fruit of consensus in order to avoid financial uncertainty”.
