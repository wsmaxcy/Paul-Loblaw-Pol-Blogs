L, The Inoculation Project 5.30.2021: Math games and a science library for 5th-graders, nomandatesforThe Inoculation Project, 2021-05-30, This week we will help complete our 900th project! We’re helping to provide math games for a 5th-grade classroom in Laredo Texas and a science library for a 5th-grade classroom in Oklahoma City.  We hope that readers who support quality public school education will help these teachers and students by sharing or supporting our featured projects. The Inoculation Project is an ongoing volunteer effort to crowdfund science and math projects for red-state public schools in low-income neighborhoods. As always our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that facilitates tax-deductible donations to specific vetted projects in public schools. Let’s take advantage of a matching offer to provide math games for this never-before-funded teacher’s classroom! Resources:  Help me give my students these math games to be able to have more hands-on experiences. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  Senator Judith Zaffirini Elementary School Laredo Texas Total:  $358.80 (2x match offer!) Still Needed:  $358.80  Completed thank you! Hope to see you at next Sunday’s party. Teacher’s Comments from Mrs. C. Villarreal: My Students:  I am a 5th grade Math teacher with students from low social economic status. I am a proud teacher of 68 students (GT Regular and 504/Special Ed). As of this year due to the pandemic education has become a very difficult task. My students log in everyday and really try very hard to be successful. We have a lot of internet connectivity problems and still we manage to learn something new everyday. I admire my students because they have been able to cope with the changes and adapt to learning remotely. We try to go through the day as if nothing was different or even difficult. My Project:  These materials will help my students with experiencing the hands-on situations at the same time enjoying themselves and learning. They will be able to learn from each other and strengthen their skills and learn from their peers. When students work together they tend to be more receptive and less embarrassed to ask questions making learning possible and enjoyable at the same time. They are able to use their cognitive thinking skills and share with one another what they have learn and learn new things as well. Working in groups has proven to be beneficial for students. List of requested math games: The teacher also requested 3 Happy Birthday Pencil Packs. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!

Resources:  Help me give my students an entire set of books about a variety of science topics that they will love! Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  Taft Fifth Grade Center at Linwood Oklahoma City Oklahoma Total:  $498.40 Still Needed:  $143.58  Completed thank you! Teacher’s Comments from Ms. Epler: My Students:  My class consists of 45 hard-working students who put their heart into everything they do! Most of them are English language learners meaning that their primary language is not English. Because of this they learn best through visual representation and hands-on activities. The students that will benefit from this project are super dedicated and want to learn. They love math and science and they have the greatest personalities! My Project:  As an educator I am constantly trying to find ways to teach my students the things they need to know using learning strategies that they enjoy. This is exactly why this Learning Science Libraries book set will be so helpful to our classroom. I am wanting to provide my students with grade level books about the science topics we are discussing in class. My students love to read and will tackle any book that they can get their hands on. With a library of books from a variety of science topics they will not only have the opportunity to develop their reading skills but they will also be learning in a way that they enjoy. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference! The requested set of 40 science books comprises these eight collections:                   Last week’s main project — Tarpon Rockets To The Sky — was completed within 30 minutes of posting last Sunday!  Thank you so much for investing in my students. The experience they will have will be an exciting one because of your generous donation. They have been so inspired y Space X since we have as neighbors 30 minutes away. They will finally see math and engineering in action with their own hands. Bless God You! With gratitudeMs. Gonzalez  Founded in 2009 The Inoculation Project combats the anti-science push in conservative America by funding science and math projects in traditionally red-state classrooms and libraries. Our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a crowdfunding charity founded in 2000 and highly rated by both Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau. Every Sunday we focus on helping to fund science or math projects preferably in neighborhood public schools where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income households. We welcome everyone who supports public school education — no money is required! Finally here’s our list of successfully funded projects — our series total is 899! The success-list diary also contains links and additional information about DonorsChoose.org.
