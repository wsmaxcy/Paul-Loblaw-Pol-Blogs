L, Pandemic Observations -- April 28 Top 40+ Nations (All Eyes Still on India):, Irontortoise, 2021-04-29, As noted last week worldometers is now including 7-day stats and weekly trends on their website (though not for US states yet) so to try and stay one step ahead in provided info I’m now including a 14-Day Change column for both new Covid-19 deaths and cases so readers can more accurately assess what part of the pandemic curve each country is currently on: Meanwhile despite nearly twice as many nations registering a declining number of new cases this week than those showing an increase the global totals continue to edge ever higher into record territory dragged along almost exclusively on the back of an India now facing truly apocalyptic conditions and accounting for a staggering 42% of the world total this week. India’s current weekly caseload is already 1/3 higher than the previous high-water mark set by the US back in January and though it seems to have backed off from its previous hyper-exponential weekly growth rate of >60% (if this is not just an artifact of a collapsing health care system) it still could reach the previously unimaginable level of 3 million new cases per week in the next couple of weeks.  Even on a per capita basis India has jumped from 50th position last week clear up to 28th this week and could reach the top 20 by next week but far worse is that they are now on track to blow past the weekly death toll records of both Brazil (21878) and the US (24295) in the next few days. Elsewhere Hungary continues to dominate the weekly per capita death toll rankings for an incredible 38 days straight now and though its well into a declining phase by this point it doesn’t look like any other nation is in a position to overtake it anytime soon — even Uruguay appears to have passed its peak despite remaining atop the per capita new case rankings for 25 days and still counting. 7-Day D/1M 7-Day Deaths Weekly Change 14.Day Change Change fr Max 7-Day C/1M 7-Day Cases Weekly Change 14.Day Change Change fr Max World  11.9  92460  7%  15%  -9%  Rank  World  743  5786969  3%  22%  0%  Weekly New Deaths Table <   > Weekly New Cases Table D/1M = Covid-19 deaths per 1 million population over prior 7 days C/1M = New Covid-19 cases per 1 million population over prior 7 days Weekly Change = Net change from previous week's stats 14.Day Change = Net change from prior 14-Day period’s stats Change fr Max = Net change from week of peak deaths or new case Note:  Only nations with a cumulative total of 100+ Covid-19 fatalities included All data derived from worldometer
