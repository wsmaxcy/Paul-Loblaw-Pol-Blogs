C, Mid-Week in Pictures: Stairmaster Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-24, It’s only Wednesday and yet in eight years of TWiPping (I counted) I think this week has set a record for the inventory of TWiP-worthy items on the pile for Saturday and as such calls for an extraordinary mid-week edition as we did a year ago when the Central-Plan-demic started. And it isn’t hard to guess what most of the material is about just now:                                     And finally. . .  See everybody again on Saturday! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
