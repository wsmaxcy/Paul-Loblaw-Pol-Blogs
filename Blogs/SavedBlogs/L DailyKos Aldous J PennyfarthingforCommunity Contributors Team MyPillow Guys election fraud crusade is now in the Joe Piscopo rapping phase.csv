L, MyPillow Guy's election fraud crusade is now in the Joe Piscopo rapping phase, Aldous J PennyfarthingforCommunity Contributors Team, 2021-05-11, It’s been a while since I weighed in on Mike Lindell’s social media platform Frankspeech and his increasingly deranged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election which Donald Trump lost like the losingest loser in Losertown Loser Province Loservania. To Lindell it’s simply not possible that the nice well-spoken boundlessly compassionate man who’s pretending to be president right now could have gotten more votes than the anthropomorphic ass polyp we surgically removed and vaulted into space on Jan. 20. Something fishy must have gone down on Nov. 3.  Proving that resilience and determination are only virtues if your head is filled with gray matter instead of lumpy shredded pillow detritus Lindell hosted a sparsely attended “rally” at the Corn Palace in Mitchell South Dakota. It was a kickoff for Lindell’s Frankspeech platform which he’s promised will rival Twitter and YouTube in sheer awesome online platforminess. It’s an odd time for a launch party since Frankspeech has been up and “running” (like undercooked egg yolks) since April 19—more than three weeks ago. Also Frankspeech.com still isn’t working as envisioned … unless you’re talking about how I envisioned it which was as a weird paella of loony Lindell clips and Diamond & Silk columns that prove exactly nothing other than how amateurish this whole enterprise has been.  Monday’s event held in a venue that seats roughly 3200 drew just 1500 ardent fans. According to my best estimate there are at most 1500 people in attendance at Mike Lindell's "Frank" rally. Many empty seats in the venue that holds 3200. It seems like Lindell is also short of the 30K people he boasted would show up too! pic.twitter.com/qXLD3ZNY1y It was a truly underwhelming “crowd.” seems like the demand for #FrankSpeech is a little less than imagined.Lindell imagines we want to cancel him...doesn’t realize he is too irrelevant to be cancelled. pic.twitter.com/CkBYhjHZjT Never mind any of that because I’ve buried the lede—bigly. While no new evidence about election fraud surfaced attendees were treated to a rap by Saturday Night Live alum and Lindell friend Joe Piscopo. It went just as you might imagine.  And … scene. Of course that doesn’t make me question the legitimate results of our free and fair election but it does make me wonder why God would destroy Sodom and Gomorrah after a few dudes rubbed one out to other dudes and yet He won’t do shit about a washed-up comedian coming up with his own Soul Man outtakes.  All Piscopo rap jokes aside Lindell still thinks the “evidence” he’s compiled will compel the Supreme Court to vote 9-0 to “pull down” this election. Lindell tonight announces his master plan. He is going to play his ‘evidence’ for one hour each night for 5 weeks on his new platform. After that “everyone in the country” will rise up and pressure the Supreme Court so much that they will vote 9-0 to make Trump president again. pic.twitter.com/ydimEoBNwC Lindell’s 15 minutes have long been up but maybe someone can do a recount and give him another five or 10. What he does with his extra time is his business. But I can tell you right now it won’t fucking matter.  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter that is). What is it?
