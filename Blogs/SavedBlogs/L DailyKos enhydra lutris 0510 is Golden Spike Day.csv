L, 05/10 is Golden Spike Day, enhydra lutris, 2021-05-10, Today is day 130 of the Gregorian Calendar yearSetting Orange Discord 57 3187 YOLD (discordian)And let us not forget 13.0.8.9.2 mlc (the Mayan Long Count) No! Don't go there.  In the first place it was "The Man With The Golden Arm" not Golden Spike. Golden Spike Day commemorates the driving of the golden spike for the "Transcontinental Railroad" on May 10 1869 the USA's first nation-wide media event.  Presaging those to follow it was mostly bullshit in numerous particulars.  So what happened?  The so-called transcontinental railroad was formed by the junction of the Central Pacific RR out of Sacramento CA ( about 95 miles from the ocean at San Francisco) and the Union Pacific RR out of Omaha NB ( 1153 miles from the ocean at Baltimore MD) at Promontory Point UT.  A train from each end was driven to the end of its line and the last rails were placed. (For the record the UP crew was Irish and the CP crew was Chinese.)  The last rail was spiked into a special tie made from California Bay Laurel with a golden spike driven by Leland Stanford (CP) and Thomas Durant (UP) using a silver (plated) mallet.  The simple fact is that you don't drive golden spikes into laurel with anything short of magic so a hole was pre-drilled into the laurel tie somebody dropped the spike into it and it was then tapped into place. Leland Stanford being astoundingly unaccustomed to any sort of physical labor took the silver hammer and took a swing like he had seen the workmen do and missed the spike completely.  Not to be outdone Thomas Durant stepped up to the plate grabbed the mallet and missed the whole damn tie.  Some unknown worker then stepped in and tapped the spike into place and word was telegraphed far and wide that it was done. Not necessarily in this order the spike and tie were pulled lest they be stolen and replaced with ordinary serviceable ones the two trains rolled forward until their cowcatchers touched and a great photo shoot took place and history was more or less made.  Meanwhile out west the CP line was stalled at the town of Lathrop 60 miles from Sackamenna by a minor detail known as the San Joaquin River.  A bridge was eventually built and rail connections laid in September 1869 a paltry 4 months after the fact.  To the east the UP line was stalled at Council Bluffs by the Misery which they did not manage to bridge and link up to Omaha until 1872. Still landlocked at both ends though there was some river traffic between Sackamenna and San Francisco it was nevertheless in the history books forever.  In 1904 no doubt tired of the hills and curves on the promontory point route they did what they should have done ab initio and ran a new line straight across the Great Salt Lake from Ogden UT to Lucin UT and Promontory Point ceased to be on the mainline.  The rails on that section however weren't removed until 1942 when they were salvaged for wartime uses.  The US successfully launched its very own V-2 rocket on May 10 1946 almost exactly a year after  VE Day (May 8 1945).  Why the long delay one might ask and well one might.  We will most probably never ever know and should be very reluctant to accept any official explanation be it from the government or the MIC (assuming that they aren't really one and the same).  I do however have a working hypothesis.  Beyond the probable graft corruption and division of spoils in the form of contracts and subcontracts I strongly suspect that the originals were metric that any plans documents computations and the like were metric.  Further the German scientists "voluntarily" working on our project probably thought and computed in metric..  Meanwhile we had all these sub-contractors running around going "Does anybody have a metric torque wrench or a tape measure with centimeters?"  Being USA we couldn't just order some from abroad which would make it seem that we weren't up to the task but had to manufacture our own and not just tools but precision tools gauges measuring devices calibration kits and shit like that.  I mean I don't know but that's my guess. I mean this was 1946 and we lost a Mars orbiter in 1999 because Lockheed still used Imperial Units for a critical computation..
