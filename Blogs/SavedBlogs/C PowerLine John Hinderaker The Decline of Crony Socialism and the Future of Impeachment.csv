C, The Decline of Crony Socialism and the Future of Impeachment, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-17, Guest hosting for Dan Proft last night on the Salem network one of my guests was former Congressman Thaddeus McCotter who talked about the decline of crony socialism. An optimistic take? Yes and that is what we need these days: I did several monologues of which this was the longest. It is about the future of impeachment now that the Democrats have dramatically lowered the bar. It may not be new to Power Line readers but I think is still worth a listen: While we were pre-recording tonight’s show I learned of Rush Limbaugh’s death. I did a spontaneous tribute to Rush that probably won’t be available for download for a few more hours but I plan to post it tomorrow. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
