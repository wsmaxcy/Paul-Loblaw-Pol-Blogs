C, Black community in Philly protests against the police but also complains that police aren't solving enough killings, Dana Pico, 2020-12-11, I was doing some research looking for a story I remembered in which then Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey decried the “no snitchin'” culture in the heavily black neighborhoods of Philadelphia when I came across a story about his announced retirement. by Aubrey Whelan and Claudia Vargas Inquirer Staff Writers| October 14 2015 Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey couldn’t stand the thought of burying another one of his own. It was March and he had long been thinking of retirement ever since Mayor Nutter had won reelection. Even then he had been “95 percent sure.” His career was at an apex – there had been presidential appointments and prominent positions on national policing boards and an unprecedented drop in homicides in a city once dubbed “Killadelphia.” When 2015 ended there had been 280 homicides in the City of Brotherly Love an unfortunate jump from 248 the previous year but overall he presided over a sharp drop in murder. In 2007 the year before he became Commissioner there were 391 bodies laying in the city streets. In Mayor Michael Nutter’s (D-Philadelphia) and the new Commissioner’s first year homicides dropped to 331 and then to 302 the following year. 2013 saw 246 homicides the lowest number since 1967. It seems that the city has re-earned that nickname! As of December 9th Killadelphia had seen 465 corpses homicides. That’s good for the bronze medal 3rd place in all of the city’s long history under Mayor Nutter’s successor Jim Kenney (D-Philadelphia) under ‘social justice’ District Attorney Larry Krasner the beneficiary of George Soros’ campaign millions and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw who seems to be trying but is little more than a pawn and tool of Mayor Kenney and had her own ‘social justice’ history in Oakland and Portland. What moved me to do that research in the first place? It was this article in The Philadelphia Inquirer: by Chris Palmer Mike Newall Mensah M. Dean and Dylan Purcell | December 10 2020 | 5:00 AM EST Every trip outside the house for Jackee Nichols brings a new reminder of the pain. Nichols is from a part of South Philadelphia that has been embroiled in a shooting conflict for as long as anyone can remember. In October 2018 that violence claimed her 15-year-old grandson. Police believe he was gunned down for living on the wrong block — but like most shootings in Philadelphia no one has been charged in the crime. Now Nichols faces the daily torment of living among the people she suspects killed her grandson Rasul Benson leaving trauma to resurface in unexpected moments. There is of course the very #woke notation that this article was “One in an occasional series about Philadelphia’s unchecked gun violence” as though a gun an inanimate object is somehow responsible and not the criminal mindset allowed to run rampant through Strawberry Mansion and not-so-Nicetown. “Gun violence” is the euphemism used by the credentialed media and the left to avoid blaming actual people.¹ Nichols 57 a devout Muslim raced home and cried and prayed for forgiveness overwhelmed by the feeling that she has been ignored by police abandoned by some in her neighborhood and failed by a city she believes has turned an uncaring eye toward unsolved killings. “It seems to me” she said her voice catching “like you all forgot about my boy.” Nichols’ pain is one shared by thousands of Philadelphians because city law enforcement is failing to fulfill one of its most fundamental responsibilities: Secure justice when people are shot. There are people in her neighborhood who know who murdered her grandson but unless someone actually tells the police gives them some clues as to who did it and why don’t blame “city law enforcement.” The police depend on the public to help them. The article goes on to include some grisly statistics: Then the #woke had to have their say: What’s more in a historically segregated city where Black and brown neighborhoods have long suffered from government disinvestment institutional racism and heavy-handed police tactics The Inquirer found that this system has disproportionately failed these communities. Since 2015 almost 2700 young Black men were wounded in shootings but suspected triggermen were convicted in only 6% of their cases. White men of the same age were three times as likely to see their shooters convicted. Uhhh if white victims of the same age were thrice as likely to see the men who shot them tried and convicted isn’t it possible just possible that it was because a greater percentage of white witnesses cooperated with the police? Of course the #woke among the Inquirer’s reportorial staff would never even ask that question. Instead they’d frame the statistic as they did by blaming “institutional racism”. Remember they forced Stan Wischnowski senior vice president and executive editor of the Inquirer to resign and the paper to issue an apology because their precious little feelings were hurt. One has to ask: why if the black community in Philadelphia are so upset that the police are not solving many of the homicides in black neighborhoods are so many from that community demanding that the city ‘defund the police’? Would not reducing the resources available to the Philadelphia Police Department be more probable to reduce the number of crimes that they can solve the number of patrols they can do? The article does note the ‘defund’ movement but uncritically states that it’s the fault of the police because the black community do not trust them. Police say they are embracing reform developing smarter more targeted tactics and trying to overcome the challenge of making cases when so many witnesses don’t want to talk. Within the Philadelphia Police Department many officers — including Commissioner Danielle Outlaw — have also grown increasingly outspoken about what they view as a criminal justice system and reform-oriented prosecutor’s office that have not cracked down hard enough on illegal guns. “The criminal community they’re more emboldened to go out and do more” Outlaw said in an interview. Conviction rates for nonfatal shootings and illegal gun possession have fallen since District Attorney Larry Krasner took office in 2018 according to data published by his office. Some police commanders also complain that repeat offenders now routinely get low bail or shorter sentences for gun crimes. Still Outlaw acknowledged that the Police Department is primarily responsible for building investigations to get suspected shooters off the street. And the failure to secure justice in the vast majority of gun-violence cases she said was “very concerning for obvious reasons.” I’ve noted the failures of Mr Krasner’s office previously but they aren’t failures to him: he wants to see shorter jail terms he wants to see fewer criminals convicted. And once again the “gun violence” trope is used. Instead the Inquirer published a sympathetic story just the previous day about cop killer Wesley Cook who calls himself Mumia Abu-Jamal these days and poor Mr Cook’s 39 years locked up for the murder of Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner. by Mensah M. Dean | December 9 2020 Supporters of Mumia Abu-Jamal who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981 used the 39th anniversary of his arrest to call for his release from prison on Wednesday saying he was innocent. They also condemned the 1985 bombing of the MOVE compound in West Philadelphia and rejected a recent apology Philadelphia city councilmembers offered for the city’s actions that day in starting a fire that killed 11 people. Well in one way that apology was worthless: none of the Philadelphia councilmembers were in office thirty-five years ago and none of them had anything to do with the MOVE action. How can anyone apologize for someone else’s actions? The group many of them MOVE members gathered at the corner of 52nd and Larchwood Streets to demand freedom for Abu-Jamal 66 a MOVE supporter who lived under a death sentence for two decades before his sentence was overturned by a federal judge in 2001. He’s now serving life without parole for the Dec. 9 1981 slaying of Officer Daniel Faulkner. Despite Abu-Jamal’s conviction and numerous failed appeals his supporters maintain that he is not guilty of killing Faulkner who was 25 and that his trial was tainted by racism and corruption. Well of course they do. There’s no evidence that Mr Cook² did not shoot Officer Faulkner but that doesn’t matter: they don’t care if he is actually innocent but are deifying him precisely because he did kill a police officer. Yet the same people are complaining that the Philadelphia Police Department isn’t bringing murderers in their own communities to justice. In virtually every one of the murders in Philadelphia there are people who were not involved but who know who the killers are who have all of the evidence the police and even the stupid District Attorney need to make the arrests and win the convictions to lock these killers away for the rest of their miserable lives. Instead the left pretend that the problem is ‘mass incarceration’ when the real problem is that not enough criminals are incarcerated for not long enough.

¹ – In my personal website’s Stylebook I note that “The term “gun violence” is if you will pardon the pun a politically loaded one meant to convey the impression that an inanimate object was somehow violent all by itself. Sensible writers should use the term “shooting” to make it clear that a person committed the violent act.” I do not use the term “gun violence” save in direct quotes or to mock the concept that guns are somehow responsible for murder.
