L, Rally Signs: Women for Trump Latinos for Trump Blacks for Trump but no Whites for Trump signs, HalBrown, 2021-04-30, Above: These are some of the signs you never saw at a Trump rally.  Aside from the obvious symbolism that Trump is kissing the “Women for Trump” sign I thought I’d change the original photo (below) to illustrate the truth. The truth is obviously that Trump’s supporters are almost all white. How many are white supremacists bigots or have racist tendencies is difficult to measure but there have been many articles published about this. (Internet Search) You can bet that those who fit into any of these categories didn’t vote for Joe Biden. The majority of Trump supporters were and are men. However as this article shows many were and are also white women both in 2016 and 2020. One of the most notable trends to emerge from the 2016 presidential election was the large number of white women who helped solidify Donald Trump’s victory. Many of them lived in suburbs and their support for a grab-’em-by-the-pussy candidate despite his sexist racist and derogatory behavior on the campaign trail was a dark reminder that some women were still more interested in protecting their privilege than fighting for equality. Trump had many supporters who didn’t think the fact that he was a hard-core racist or pussy grabbing misogynist to be important. Trump had a not insignificant number Black supporters. Twice as many of them were men than were women. This article explains why.  Despite his cruelty to those trying to immigrate from Latin-American countries Trump had support in the Latino population although this decreased in the 2020 election. See article below. Much has been written about why so many Whites support Trump “We need to talk about the white people who voted for Donald Trump” for example. I thought that this needed to have an image of a crowd with Trump signs to illustrate the truth of the matter.
