L, Took a village to watch&listen to the rank stupidity & incompetence that took so many lives., Egberto Willies, 2021-04-23, It is hard to believe that our American village could elect a man that does not even know how uneducated and uninformed he is. See full episodes here. It was a year ago today when the world got to see the depths of the 45th president’s ineptitude lack of intelligence and stupidity. The problem is that those failures caused the deaths of over 500 thousand Americans and counting. While one must blame the president his supporting cast knew better and continued the charade. The sad thing is that many defended the former president when he almost poisoned them with his injecting-Clorox-or-Lysol suggestions. Brian Williams completely decimated not only the president but the sycophants that surrounded him. He saved a major ire for Dr. Deborah Birx. "We've since lost over half a million again since that day" Williams said. "And after that day from the CDC to Clorox to Lysol companies organizations were forced to issue statements warning folks not to ingest such chemicals. Nonetheless there was later a rise in calls to poison control hotlines poison patients showing up in emergency rooms. And lest we forget Dr. Birx sat there. In fact it's rather remarkable looking back on it that pulling a Birx or Birxing haven't since entered our lexicon as terms meaning to remain quiet in the face of malpractice and mass death." And then this could not be more prescient. “It truly took a village.” Brian Williams said. “To watch & listen to the rank stupidity & incompetence that took so many lives. But as we just saw it’s important to remember it all started at the top.” It could not be said any better.
