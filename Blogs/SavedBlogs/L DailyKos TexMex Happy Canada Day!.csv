L, Happy Canada Day!, TexMex, 2021-07-01, Happy Canada Day to all Canadians wherever you are!  I can’t say much about those poor children too sad for words.  I did what I could while in Lethbridge to help First Nations students at the University of Lethbridge. LOL One of them told me “ Oh yeah you are from the tortilla tribe.”  Lot’s of folk had never seen a TexMex in Southern Alberta.
