L, Sen. Marsha Blackburn Thumbs Her Nose At Capitol Police, Heather, 2021-03-28, Tennessee GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn apparently believes she's above the law. It was Thursday afternoon before a Senate recess was about to begin and  senators were in a hurry -- especially Marsha Blackburn.  As senators bolted from the chamber after the week's final vote to  catch their afternoon flights the Tennessee Republican hopped in a  waiting car along with an aide and made her way down Constitution  Avenue. But the car was pulled over by US Capitol Police. Blackburn  then jumped out of the car identified herself as a senator and showed  the officer her congressional pin according to a text message and a  source familiar with the matter. The officer then let the car go. US  Capitol Police says it has no record of the incident yet the senator's  office later confirmed the account and said it was the police asking  for her identification.... [...] Leo Kowalski an aide to Blackburn told his friends that after being pulled over the senator "hopped out flashed her pin hopped back in the car [and] said 'drive!'"  As Kyle Griffin noted she may run afoul of Senate ethics rules not that there will be any real consequences for that. Republican Marsha Blackburn's car was pulled over by Capitol Police this week. Blackburn jumped out and showed the officer her congressional pin. The officer let the car go.Legal experts believe it might run afoul of Senate ethics rules.https://t.co/lZ7opOzYhm ‚Äî Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 26 2021 And as others discussed on Twitter it's a good thing for her she's white or things might have gone very differently. So a Republican U.S. Senator can flash her congressional pin after her car is pulled over by Capitol Police - but a Democratic State Representative in Georgia is arrested cuffed and physically removed by state police and charged with two felonies for knocking on Gov.

The white privilege & entitled thought about I‚Äôll flashed my congressional pin. The worst part was that it worked. A Black person if he/she is lucky would get a ticket & not get shot. ‚Äî Marc (@Marc11448182) March 27 2021 Well that's all Black people have been doing wrong these centuries. They just needed to show the police their lapel pins. Glad we could clear that up. ‚Äî Chris Hennessey (@chrishennessey) March 26 2021 As opposed to be arrested for knocking while black https://t.co/QYqPTkRwWT ‚Äî Erik Halvorsen (@erikhalvorsen18) March 26 2021 Meanwhile you can get arrested for passing out water to people waiting in line to vote ‚Äî Tyler (he/him/his) (@herrtylerj) March 26 2021 If she was black they would have shot her as soon as she 'jumped out' ‚Äî Sedition Track (@seditiontrack) March 26 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
