L, Virtual Fridays Without Fitzpatrick (VFWF) 11, SteveCickay, 2021-04-25, Virtual Fridays Without Fitzpatrick (VFWF) 11 In Response To Your 04/23/21 Newsletter                                            In Case You Missed It    Congressman Fitzpatrick failed to mention a cataclysmic event in the world of Racial Justice.  Congressman Fitzpatrick failed to mention a positive development in the world of Political Justice (but sadly voted against legislation that would make our country more politically just).  Congressman Fitzpatrick failed to mention how he would fund his tiny and timid Infrastructure Plan (unlike President Biden’s big and bold plan) since in the world of Economic Justice sadly our Congressman prefers to shovel our money to the rich and let them keep it forever. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- But don’t feel bad for missing these important things that our Congressman failed to mention. He obviously doesn’t want you to remember his stand on these Justice issues but he does want you to remember the happy pictures of himself with high school kids and Boy Scouts to convince you he is a nice guy.  Yes a nice guy who is doing nothing to make America a more just and equal place for us all. The murderer of George Floyd was convicted this week on all three counts. The bogus defense arguments were quickly dismissed by the jury who saw the obvious facts that even a 9 year old child understood: a cruel police officer brazenly killing a Black man on video for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. For almost a year protests erupted all across our country and the world as America began to come to terms with the systemic racism embedded within our institution of policing. Finally other police officers broke their silence and testified against their fellow officer in the light of the overwhelming evidence of his crime. This week the murderer of George Floyd was convicted on all three counts.  Yet our Congressman who routinely takes money from police PACs said nothing to us about this cataclysmic event. Instead we heard the sound of his silence.   This week the House passed H.R. 51 which would grant statehood to the District of Columbia thereby giving full political representation to over 700000 American citizens (more citizens than live in Vermont and Wyoming). This bill advances our democracy by allowing for the enfranchisement of over 70000 Americans who currently do not have equal political representation that all other Americans in the 50 states  enjoy. “Although DC has a larger population than some states the District is not one of the fifty states and so has no senators and its representative in the House of Representatives is a delegate with limited voting privileges. Delegates have a marginalized role in Congress and their constituents are not represented in Congress in the same manner as most citizens.” Not only did our Congressman fail to mention this significant advance for our democracy he failed to mention that he “Mr. Independent” voted along with his Republican herd AGAINST enfranchising over 700000 citizens who pay taxes. I guess “taxation without representation” is okay with our Congressman. And King George the Third. Within his first 100 days President Biden presented a big bold Infrastructure Plan with his “American Jobs Plan” (unlike his Republican predecessor who kept teasing us about an “Infrastructure Week” that never came). And he outlined a way to pay for this by dealing with the economic injustice of growing income inequality which your Republican Party had unleashed on the American working class since the days of that other entertainment star Republican president 40 years ago. President Biden proposed to raise taxes on the rich to pay for things all Americans need: a viable job-producing sustainable infrastructure. You on the other hand voted in 2017 for a tax scam for the rich which did nothing to improve our ailing infrastructure but instead increased the national debt by 2 trillion dollars and worsened income inequality. Your scaled down infrastructure proposal fails to mention key specifics of what it will cost and how you will pay for it so it will inevitably go nowhere fast. Your proposal does nothing to address economic injustice of income equality. Yes we hear more sounds of silence from you on yet another critical issue Economic Injustice which threatens our people our prosperity and our nation. “Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence” The vision I see when I hear your silence about these critical issues is an America where critical issues of Racial Political and Economic justice are ignored. In case you missed it that is what is missed by your constituents: leadership to make our country a more just place for all. And what is so exasperating is that it is not that hard to take a leadership role about these key moral and political issues if one’s motivation is truly the good of the country and not allegiance to Party or ideology or preservation of personal political power. We already have great local leaders who are not afraid to take stands in public about these critical issues. They do not stay silent but speak out against injustice to inspire us to make our country a more just place for all. I will leave you this week with one such powerful voice. Perhaps she will inspire you to break your silence. “NAACP grateful for Derek Chauvin conviction We are gratified that the jury in this case knew that what we all saw on that tape was purely and simply murder. They recognized that a badge is not a shield from accountability. Unfortunately even since the murder of George Floyd we continue to see police behavior that makes every Black parent afraid for their children when they leave the house. All of us deserve to know we are safe with and protected by our police. We must stand together to demand substantive reform that delivers real public safety for everyone no matter the color of their skin. We call on all who believe in the promise of America to join us in: - Ending the horrors of police brutality and a criminal justice system that has failed us so often - Demanding that our Pennsylvania General Assembly pass substantive reform that holds police accountable and makes families and communities safer - Calling for the collection of data on police encounters - Ending qualified immunity that shields law enforcement from any responsibility for their actions Let us together ensure that the deaths of George Floyd and so many others before and since were not in vain.
