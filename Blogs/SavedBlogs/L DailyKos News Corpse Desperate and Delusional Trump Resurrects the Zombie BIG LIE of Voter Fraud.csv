L, Desperate and Delusional Trump Resurrects the Zombie 'BIG LIE' of Voter Fraud, News Corpse, 2021-04-23, STOP THE MADNESS! It seems that Donald Trump is still pining away in his Mar-a-Lago bunker trying to convince himself - and any fractured soul who will listen - that he really did win the 2020 presidential election despite the fact every analysis in every state by every political party proves otherwise. He simply can't handle being America's Biggest Loser. Now three months after Joe Biden was inaugurated five months after the election Trump continues to cling pathetically to his warped version of reality. Upon having learned that a group of conspiracy crackpots succeeded in getting the Arizona Senate to allow them to conduct a recount of the Maricopa County votes Trump weighed in with his usual impotent bombast. In a "press release" (since he's been banished from most social media due to his promulgation of pathological lies) Trump wrote that... For the record Trump's loss in Arizona is not in dispute. There were two recounts that validated the results. The election board consisting of four Republicans and one Democrat certified the results. The "brave and patriotic Republican State Senators" Trump is referring to are actually just a gang of partisan thugs hoping to discredit the American electoral process. That's a goal that Republicans share with Russian operatives who have been trying to do the same thing. There is absolutely zero evidence of any voter fraud large scale or not. And this recount isn't going to find any using legitimate methods. Unfortunately they don't intend to use any legitimate methods. The firm hired by the Arizona GOP Senate is one that has been conspicuously involved in some of the most bizarre conspiracy theories circulating in Trump's QAnon infested world. Rachel Maddow covered it in depth on Thursday night: Trump went on to whine that Democrats had "sent 73 lawyers to Arizona in an effort to stop this recount." Which of course wasn't true. But Democrats did file a motion to challenge it. Trump further claimed that the Arizona recount would eventually result in fraud being discovered in Wisconsin Michigan Georgia New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Once again he has no shred of evidence to support any of that. However he was pleased that the recount would be covered live by the brazenly biased purveyor of propaganda One America News Network (OANN). Trump's press release went on to criticize Arizona's Republican governor Doug Ducey and the mostly GOP County Commissioners who he alleged were all accomplices in the "scam 2020 Election" because of course they are. And he insisted that "We must never allow this to happen to our Great Country again. [and that] I predict the results will be startling!" Trump's prediction is the surest way of knowing that the whole affair is corrupt. He certainly knows who the players are and has been given assurances that they will produce the outcome he wants. None of this however will change the outcome of the election. Biden will remain President and Trump remain pathetic. But it is just this sort of dishonesty that ignited the violence at the Capitol on January 6th. And Trump and his cronies seem to be anxious to have more of it.
