L, How to Sell the Biden American Families Plan and call out the GOP Hypocrisy., aPauledInNJ, 2021-04-29, There is a very obvious way for the Biden Administration to frame the American Families Plan.   Frame it as a plan to reduce the need for Abortions. Republicans have been united in calling for an end to legal abortions.   Oklahoma just passed a fetal heartbeat bill which in effect bans abortion outright.   So the Democrats need to emphasize that the policies outlined in Biden’s American Families Plan will result in lessening the demand for Abortions. Making the child tax credit permanent would make raising a child more affordable.   Increasing access to Childcare will make it easier for mothers and fathers to work while their kids are taken care of.   Improved access to affordable health care will make the kids healthier.   Expanded Pre-K education  and tuition free community college makes it easier and more affordable to educate children. One of the main reasons for women electing to get abortions is the fact that they cannot afford the high cost of raising a child.   So call out the Republicans by running ads emphasizing that if they are really so called pro-life then they should put their (our) money where their mouths are and provide funding to programs that will enable more women to keep their children and not have to chose between a life in poverty or being able to work and affordably raise a family.    We should still make sure that safe and legal abortions are available to those that need it or want it.   This will not eliminate the need for all abortions.  There are medical reasons and other reasons a woman may choose an abortion.  But for those that make that decision based on economic necessity the Biden plan will do much to reduce the need for abortions.   Let’s how Republicans will counter that argument.
