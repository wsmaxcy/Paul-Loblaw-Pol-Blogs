L, No Respect For The Free Press, Yogannette , 2021-07-07, I’m Annette Hyde a yoga teacher from Madison County Virginia. I’m running to remove my radical right delegate Nick Freitas (R-Culpeper) from the House District 30 seat.   Two weeks ago the Culpeper County GOP leadership attempted to bar a reporter from entering a public event in a public building. After the event the committee chairman called the reporter and asked her not to report about his confrontation with her. She of course did.  To make matters worse this event was a forum for the local town council election. Never in the history of Culpeper Virginia has a party endorsed candidates. Yet the GOP decided they would try to make candidates “kiss the ring” for their seal of approval.   This is the Trump way: attack and ban the press trample the Constitution and promote the Big Lie. They are competing to be considered “Trump enough”. It’s the very mindset that led us to the election conspiracy lies and the insurrection of January 6th.    I won’t be intimidated by these juvenile attempts to censor and muddle our election process. We are giving this race everything we have. But we need your help.   July is a really slow month for fundraising. Despite smashing our previous record in June we still have staff mailers digital ads and a photo/video shoot to pay for. Can you chip in a few bucks right now and follow my social media?
