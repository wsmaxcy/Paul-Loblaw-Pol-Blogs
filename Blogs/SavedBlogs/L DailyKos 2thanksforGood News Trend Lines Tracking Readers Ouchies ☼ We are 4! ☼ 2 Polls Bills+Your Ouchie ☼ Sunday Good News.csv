L, Trend Lines: Tracking Readers' Ouchies ☼ We are 4! ☼ 2 Polls: Bill's+Your Ouchie? ☼ Sunday Good News, 2thanksforGood News, 2021-05-09,   The Good Gnus group is a community of readers writers activists supporters community builders and patriots. We begin gathering every day at 7 a.m. ET to celebrate national good news. Our most active members are of course a subgroup of members of Daily Kos whose Front Pages celebrate “News Community Action.” However you don’t have to be a member of Daily Kos to be a Gnusie. We are realists not fools idiots or ostriches. We know we live in a world where active nefarious and evil decision-makers do very bad things and create stress and anxiety in us our loved ones our friends our neighbors our allies and destroy people and systems we hold dear. However we choose to focus on the good news that people create around the country. Sometimes we create Good News. Together we are strong and resilient. We return regularly to these pages to revitalize. In a Good News Roundup the weight of bearing good news is not borne by the author alone: Gnusies can be counted on to adorn the comment section with good news. Often commenters create three times as many comments as Recommendations! If you cannot linger with us for hours I recommend you return in the mid or late afternoon learn who your favorite commenters are and Search for their names on return visits. We count on certain favorite Gnusies to bless us in the comments with humor hope history and analysis every day. Good News: We bring it we make it.  Since February 21 2021 I’ve been asking readers every Sunday to respond to this question: What is your vaccination status? I’m pleased to present the results of that polling here and I am very grateful to those readers and members of Daily Kos who have chosen to get vaccinated and participate in the poll every week. I know many agree with me: I’m elated to see these trends of readers Gnusie and Kosacks!

I hope you’ll participate (again) today [all the way down at the bottom of this diary]. In the bleak-hearted days the sagging-shoulder days the drooping-head days the weeping-soul days of May 2017 GoodNewsRoundup began posting her set-sail-and-aim-for-the-hope-horizon-now diaries on Daily Kos. Every day of the week but one she posted her rants and cheer-ups her political assessments and gentle exhortations her action steps. She had been posting her essays on FaceBook but looked for a wider audience so she came here to Daily Kos. In those days of May commenters typically posted vertical comments of thanks or mentioned specific items from the diary and all of her diaries did not reach the Trending List. I noticed her diaries appeared regularly about a week after she started posting them. As Serendipity would have it Wee Mama was the member of the Partners and Mentors Team who welcomed GoodNewsRoundup to Daily Kos! So by the time I found the Roundups the Mayor had already communicated with Wee Mama who had begun republishing her diaries to the Good News group which incidentally Wee Mama had founded. Good News all round! I suggested to GoodNewsRoundup that we speak by phone and offered her a few tips to get more readers at Daily Kos. She listened of course. I talked to her about using my community-building Daily Kos skills to get more readers and more participants so that her diaries would stay longer on the Trending List (at that time called the Recommended List) and reach a wider office to spread her messages farther. And if you were here from those beginning days maybe you observed my Welcome comment evolve as I invented rephrased and reframed new requests for participants in our growing group. In that first phone call Mayor Roundup shared that she expected to continue writing 5 or 6 days per week forever: She could not imagine not writing them. I knew that would be very difficult to achieve but I did not argue with her. Sometime later she began to give up a day of writing at a time. [More of our origin story next week. ~2t]  Please add your reminiscences in the comments: Gnusie Bill in Portland Maine lets me repeat the results of his research.

Gifts from supportive Kosacks help me pay for my wife’s medicines. If you’ve sent me a gift already I am 2thankful!   .  . I'm very pleased to see the rising trends of our vaccinations and though I cannot respond to every comment my heart takes wing when I see Gnusies announce their successful vaccinations.
