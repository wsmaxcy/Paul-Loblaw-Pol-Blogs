L, Half of congress is under threat..., decency43, 2021-07-07, Half of congress is under threat from their party leadership to follow trump regardless of what they think of trump personally- like robots! The leadership is threatening to end their members’ political careers if they don’t toe the line. That blackmail totally undermines the very reason for the existence of the congress which is to deliberate debate and compromise in good faith in order to do what’s best for the people. Party leadership in collusion with big money are openly committing sedition. The AG and the Justice Department MUST intensely focus on the party leaders and their financial backers and investigate and charge them- there is no other way end their treason!
