L, If the Trajectory of Biden’s First 100 Days Continues He Could be The Most Transformative President, RBCreamer, 2021-04-26, Robert Creamer Democracy Partners  Out of the gate the Biden White House has realized one critical overarching truth: Americans are crying for fundamental transformative change – and they will back big bold initiatives to achieve it.       Biden’s team also embraced a critical corollary: the voters don’t really give two cents about arguments over “process” Senate rules or how many Members of Congress from each party support a bill.  The voters want their government to deliver.      By understanding those two critical elements about the challenges America faces – and the American electorate -- President Biden has managed to assemble a wildly popular transformational agenda that has broad bi-partisan support among the electorate – even if it does not have support among Republican lawmakers.      If he can keep using his powers of executive action and his slim majorities in both Houses of Congress to continue his record of delivering transformational change Biden is likely to build upon those majorities in 2022 and maintain his ability to bend the arc of history toward justice for his full four-year first term.      The Biden Presidency has the potential for being fundamentally transformational in at least five different areas:        And potentially a sixth:   Transformational Economic Policy  In the years following World War II America entered a period that economist Paul Krugman calls the “Great Compression.”  There was robust economic growth but per capita income and wealth grew more for ordinary working people than it did for the wealthiest Americans.      As a result the gap in income and wealth between the rich and everyone else actually shrank – and on the average everyone did better.        That began to change in the late 1970’s as corporate America and wealthy rightwing activists fought back against unions and the programs of the Great Society and the New Deal. They consolidated power with the election of Ronald Reagan and income and wealth gaps have skyrocketed ever since – until now.      With the passage of the American Rescue Plan the Biden Administration’s proposed new tax policies the American Jobs Act and hopefully many other new initiatives it is possible that Biden’s term will be the point when the income and wealth gaps in America once again begin to shrink. s Transformation in the Role of Government      To facilitate its program of wealth transfer from ordinary people to the rich the right had to radically cut back the role of the public sector in the economy.       It spent billions propagating the view that “government was the enemy;” that government could never do anything right was hopelessly incompetent and gridlocked.  And the Republican Party did its best to guarantee this was true.        The Right declared that the “era of big government is over” – a view that was partially adopted by some Democrats in the 1990’s.        As part of this effort the Right created the economic myth that the federal budget was like a household budget and that deficit spending was simply transferring the cost of our “profligate spending” onto the next generation.  (A view that never stood in their way when they tried to cut taxes for the rich).      As a result of the Covid crisis – and the Biden Administration’s response – all of these views of government have been proven false.      Assuming that the Biden White House is in fact able to continue its effective assault on Covid-19 with a massive well-executed vaccination program and assuming it passes its robust physical and human infrastructure program it will demonstrate clearly that government is not the enemy but the instrument through which we can accomplish the critical tasks that we choose to undertake together as a society.      And the deficit hawks will be silenced by the reality that our society’s wealth does not hinge upon the frugality of our spending but rather by using government action to make certain that everyone in America has the opportunity to work and achieve their highest potential.  Creating an Inflection Point in the Struggle for Racial Justice and Gender Equity     The last two hundred years have witnessed many critical inflection points in the long battle against systemic racism that had its roots in America’s original sin: slavery. With every victory on the road to racial justice there have certainly been setbacks and demagogs like Donald Trump to erect new barriers to progress.         But as the historian John Meacham documents in his book The Soul of America the combination of mobilization and organizing in communities and strong leadership in the Presidency has always been the formula for real qualitative progress.      Those two elements have once again conjoined in the Black Lives Matter Movement and the Administration of Joe Biden and Kamila Harris. The election of Barack Obama was itself a critical inflection point in the battle for racial justice. But it could be the Administration of Biden and Harris that institutionalizes change that makes the promise of racial equality that Obama himself embodied into a reality for people of color all over America.  A critical start would be passage of the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act.      When it comes to the rights of LGBTQ Americans the House has already passed the Equity Act that extends the coverage of the Civil Rights Bill to LGBTQ Americans.  Now the Senate must act.  Transforming Our Democracy      In so many ways American government has failed to deliver on the promises of the American ideal because of critical anti-democratic elements in our political system:          The Biden Presidency could propel transformative changes that address many of these issues:   A Transformational Moment in the Fight Against Climate Change  The Obama Administration took bold steps to work with countries around the world to address the massive threat of climate change.  But Donald Trump did everything in his power to reverse those steps forward and do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry.      Trump’s actions brought us closer and closer to an irreversible tipping point toward climate disaster.     But the Biden Administration has begun with a sharp reversal of Trump’s climate denialism.  Its appointments at every level have shown a profound understanding of the crisis.  It immediately reentered the Paris Climate Accords and recently convened an international summit to address the issue – setting a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in the next nine years.      If it is successful – both in the US and internationally – we could finally see the curve of greenhouse gas emissions turn downward for the first time in the industrial age.  The Possible Transformation of the International Order      The future of humanity depends heavily on our ability to create world-wide structures for non-violent conflict resolution that are based upon democratic principles—and ultimately eliminate war and other armed conflict as a legitimate means of resolving our differences.      As the catalytic explosion of our technological power enables us to create more and more weapons that could destroy all human life – war nuclear weapons and armed conflict of any sort – are no longer adaptive for human society.       In his first 100 days President Biden has moved forcefully to restore America’s leadership in the world – and to reestablish our commitment to peaceful conflict resolution.       His administration is pursuing active discussion to reenter President Obama’s Iran agreement that simultaneously prevented Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and another war in the Middle East.        It has extended our nuclear weapons treaties with Russia.       It has re-established our commitment to international institutions like the UN and the World Health Organization.       The Administration has begun to address the flow of migrants and refugees –and understands clearly that at their root they are caused by war violence and poverty in other parts of the world – root causes that must be addressed in order to address these problems over the long haul.      But to provide justice for immigrants and refugees the Administration must ultimately be successful in passing comprehensive immigration reform and massively increasing the number of refugees who are afforded the safety promised by Lady Liberty.      The Administration’s  trickiest international challenge will be to navigate a peaceful relationship with the largest rising power in the world - China – while at the same time maintaining our commitments to our democratic values.  Conclusion      Taken as a whole Biden’s first 100 Days provide a beacon of hope that if he continues on the current trajectory he could go down in history as one of the most consequential and transformative Presidents in American history.
