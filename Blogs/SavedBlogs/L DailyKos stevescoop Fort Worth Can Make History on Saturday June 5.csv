L, Fort Worth Can Make History on Saturday June 5, stevescoop, 2021-05-09, The Texas Legislature is hard at work making it even harder for residents of the Lone Star State to register and vote. But challenged during a legislative debate the GOP backer of a new voter suppression law claimed he did not know the meaning of the phrase “Purity of the ballot box.” The Trumpist supporters of the bill had initially inserted the purity language in the proposed legislation. Unfortunately for the GOP lawmakers a Democratic colleague educated the ignorant Republican politician. It turns out Texas maintained the “Purity of the ballot box” more than 100 years ago by preventing black people from voting. What is a God-fearing Trump supporter who believes in election integrity to do? The cowardly GOP yanked the purity language before passing the bill at about 3 a.m. The Trump-loving governor who failed the state when a winter storm crippled the privately-run power system for most of Texas has promised to sign the legislation into law. But Texas Democrats including Black Texas Democrats continue to fight for democracy. Folk will no doubt sue the state once the governor dips his pen in poison to anoint the unholy law. In the meantime though Fort Worth is holding a runoff election for mayor on Saturday June 5. Fort Worth native Deborah Peoples is the Democrat who made it into the runoff. She is running against someone who once worked for the long-term city mayor who decided against running for another term. If elected Deborah Peoples will serve as the first Black mayor of Fort Worth.

Deborah’s business credentials make her stand out in this race. After a career with the City of Fort Worth helping connect more residents with city resources Deborah entered the business world.

During her years managing a team of 5000 people across 22 states Deborah ensured none of her team’s jobs were moved overseas. Deborah is poised to use this executive experience to help bring new businesses and good-paying jobs to Fort Worth. While working Deborah started a family and deepened her relationships in her church community. Compassion and conviction guided Deborah’s relationships with her loved ones and her faith and those same values will influence her leadership of Fort Worth in this time of crisis.
