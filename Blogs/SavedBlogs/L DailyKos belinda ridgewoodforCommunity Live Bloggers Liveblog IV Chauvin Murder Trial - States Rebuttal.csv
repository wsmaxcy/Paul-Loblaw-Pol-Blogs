L, Liveblog IV: Chauvin Murder Trial - State's Rebuttal, belinda ridgewoodforCommunity Live Bloggers, 2021-04-19, gchaucer2 was called away for a bit but I’m certain she’ll rejoin us in the comments as soon as she’s available.  The defense’s closing arguments extended so long that they required a lunch break in the middle. Now we’re ready for the State’s rebuttal. I am not watching the trial myself but have been following the liveblog comments and they’ve been more than enough to keep me apprised of what’s going on. My sense from reading them is that the state has presented a strong case; the defense maybe not so much. That’s good news for Justice in my book but nothing is certain until a verdict is returned. Liveblog updates on the present trial session are found in the comment thread. Many thanks to the erudite commenters who add so much value to the discussion! The liveblog schedule has been two posts per day covering the morning and afternoon court sessions.

Previous posts in this series so far:  From DRo in the previous thread: Eric Nelson expects the jury to believe that Derek Chauvin couldn’t stop killing George Floyd because the bystanders distracted him by telling him to stop killing George Floyd.   Comment from csinphilly on what I can only call the finale of the state’s rebuttal: GF said “I can’t breathe” 27 times within a few minutes. He doesn’t let up. When he is unconscious he doesn’t let up. When he has no pulse he doesn’t let up. Even when medicas arrive he doesn’t let up. They have to grab his arm to get him to let up. GF never regained consciousness. The biggest shading of the truth [defense objects to this phrase] — claim that GF died b/c he heart was too big. Reason that GF is dead is because Mr. Chauvin’s heart was too small. [mic drop]  Thanks to AKALib for locating video tweets of the end of the state’s closing argument and rebuttal. ‘This wasn’t policing. This was murder.’ — Watch the prosecution make its final case for conviction in the Derek Chauvin murder trial pic.twitter.com/IuXWTEKtAq  WHAT AN ENDING.Last words to the jury:(watch till the end)#StateRebuttal #DerekChauvinTrial #GeorgeFloyd @CourtTV pic.twitter.com/xTOz2AxtXK
