L, The Meaning of Security, jasonsibert, 2021-07-06, By Jason Sibert Last week President Joe Biden announced that he will nominate Mallory Stewart to be Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control.  This is a key job considering the United States and Russia are contemplating a successor to New START. If confirmed Stewart will lead the State Departments bureau of arm control verification and compliance. Historically the assistant secretary of state plays an important in the negotiation of treaties.  At their June 16 Geneva summit Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to begin "strategic stability" talks to "seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures."  Stewart who previously worked in the bureau and as a State Department arms control attorney was an architect of the U.S.-Russia Framework to eliminate Syria's declared chemical weapons stockpile. This is a news item that has received some attention in various outlets including a few big ones. However it’s important to put this appointment in context and think about it from the standpoint of the way news is reported. Diplomacy receives only a fraction of the news coverage as the amount we’re spending on military hardware as some politicians and pressure groups say we spend too much and others say we spend too little.  Naturally the role of money in our politics plays a role in what’s being said. We’re not talking about an honest evaluation of speech; we’re talking about how money motivates the speech we hear in the media.   The debate is framed by the military-industrial complex that seeks jobs in certain congressional districts and includes companies that make lots of money off military contracts. It’s questioned in certain circles. I’ve questioned its power in various stories over a period of five years. In addition I’ve heard “big government” denounced for years. However we spend billions and billions on various forms of military hardware and I’ve never heard this equated with “big government.” As mentioned this is a form of speech influence by the financial incentives involved in the military-industrial complex.  Lost in the argument is the true meaning of security. Arms control offers us a method of security that costs much less than the package the military-industrial complex delivers. We can say the same about international law and diplomacy We should add an understanding of the history of our world and the history of diplomacy to that list. However these things don’t deliver contracts to defense contractors or jobs to congressional districts.  What’s needed an actually talked about in certain circles – the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and Arms Control Association – is a debate about the meaning of security and how to best achieve that security. If we have that argument we’ll find we can secure our country with less spent on arms and make the homeland more secure through more investments in infrastructure research and development social insurance and affordable housing.  We desperately need to start a conversation on the real meaning of security.  Jason Sibert is the Executive Director of the Peace Economy Project in St. Louis.
