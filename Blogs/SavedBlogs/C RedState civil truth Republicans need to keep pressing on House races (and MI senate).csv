C, Republicans need to keep pressing on House races (and MI senate), civil truth, 2020-11-17, I know that the Presidency is the big prize in November’s elections but Congress is vital too especially in blocking legislation under a Biden/Harris administration if they prevail. I don’t then understand what seems to be Republican inaction in investigating and pursuing challenges to some of the very close races especially in the contested states where we have greatest evidence of fraud. The Michigan senate race which James trails by less than Trump’s margins is one key race that I’m hearing nothing about.  But more tractable should be the close House races. Today I was noticing three PA House races (PA-7 PA-8 PA-17) where the margin of Democrat victory is less than 2% in a state where there is increasing evidence of widespread vote. Here’s one very recent analysis of the statistical impossibility of the PA presidential results.

If Republicans are willing to take the effort to dig into the remaining close races the House could still be ours. In fact given the shifts in key voting demographics I am certain that a fair election should have flipped the House to Republicans including some races not thought to be in contention (given how wrong the polls were). We actually had a Red Wave election before the fraud stepped in. Let’s not let the media blitzkrieg distract us from the truth behind the election results. Don’t needlessly surrender the House. And remember that the Speaker is next in line after the VP in the line of succession.
