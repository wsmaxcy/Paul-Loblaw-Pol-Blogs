L, It's Hot!  Why We are Canvassing in this Humidity, snowbored, 2021-06-28, (This diary is the first in a series) This weekend Hope Springs from Field PAC canvassed in five states:  Florida Georgia North Carolina Pennsylvania and Texas.  Everywhere we went we got comments about the weather.  “Why are you out in this heat (or humidity)?” people would ask.  It’s a great question. Each state has a different internal goal and generally different laws that apply to what we are trying to accomplish.  This diary outlines the goals tactics and reasons behind the work we are doing during the dog days of summer in the field. In the largest sense this is make-up work.  We lost a presidential cycle -- a key cycle -- in the field because of Covid-19.  Democrats made the right decision to forego knocking on doors in order to not exacerbate the spread of the pandemic but we have to realize that it set us behind.  As one Democratic strategist noted “We’ve never had a situation where the two sides run different campaigns because of a public health crisis.”  There were many many places where Republicans and conservative groups continued their field work to great effect. Trump senior adviser Susie Wiles admitted that the campaign “built margin through hyper-targeted voter registration messaging persuasion and Get-Out-The-Vote efforts” targeting “strategic demographic groups that are not traditional Republican supporters with messaging that was uniquely tailored to them.” While pro-Biden ads dominated television in Florida the GOP outworked Democrats on the ground narrowing the voter registration gap between the two parties to its smallest margin in decades. Democrats pulled back on neighborhood canvassing until the homestretch of the campaign because of the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats had hoped to register half a million voters in Florida before the 2020 election but instead saw Republicans go into the general election with a net gain of 193196 new voters over 2016.  50000 of those new voters were registered in the last month before the registration deadline.   The result in Miami-Dade normally a Democratic stronghold where Democrats lost two Congressional seats and a key state senate seat was a shock: "Trump’s gains in Miami-Dade accounted for about 75 percent of his gain in net votes in the state over 2016." The Libre Initiative (another Koch entity) which is based out of Miami-Dade took it's proven techniques in deep organizing to the Rio Grande valley (AKA "The Valley") to great effect.  Organizing not just voter registration emboldened Latinos there who were inclined to support Trump.  Almost overnight in an area where the old Beto (valley not Brownsville) HQ stands empty but its sign still visible from the Interstate Trump supporters put flags on their trucks (and boats) and showed their pride.  Machismo sure.  But in The Valley where Democrats have long reigned supreme it was a shock to the system.  Because of deep organizing repeated voter contact and peer-to-peer messaging. We did not have a sustained all-in voter contact program in 2020.  And the shock waves from the 2020 results are still reverberating.  Even though Trump lost the gains they made have lingered to support the pipe dream that Trump actually won.  And Democrats lost a whole cycle's worth of field organizers who understand the interactive nature of both organic and targeted field work. That's important because unlike Republicans and the conservatives that align with them Democratic campaign field organizers are much much more likely to move on to policy work or return to their education or go on to careers outside of field organizing.  Entire skill sets have been lost or hidden from view.  We have make-up work to do but far far fewer organizers with the training experience and data-oriented analytical abilities to recover.  It's not a Lost Generation but the impact is just as significant.  This is exacerbated by the lack of sustaining training and education in the political arts like Republicans and conservatives have in the Leadership Institute. Hope Springs from Field PAC is knocking on doors in a grassroots-led effort to make up this gap.  We are thinking how to mitigate Voter Suppression efforts get around them and make sure we have "super compliance" helping our voters meet the requirements and get out and vote.  We are taking those efforts to the doors of the communities most effected (the intended targets or victims) of these new voter suppression laws. Obviously we rely on grassroots support so if you support field/grassroots organizing and our efforts to protect our voters we would certainly appreciate your support: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/voterprotection Hope Springs from Field PAC was started by former Obama Field Organizers because field was the cornerstone of our success.  The approach we adopted was focused on listening on connecting voters and their story to the candidate.  Repeated face to face interactions are critical.  And we are among those who believe that Democrats didn’t do as well in the 2020 Congressional races as expected because we didn’t knock on doors.  We are returning to the old school basics: repeated contacts repeated efforts to remind them of protocols meeting them were they are.  Mentoring those who need it (like first time and newly registered voters). Republican Voting Rights Suppression is the second reason we are out in the heat this summer -- and hopefully through 2022 Labor Day.  Protesting the new laws and taking them to court is great but these laws often make assumptions about Democratic voters that we can actually do something about.  For example requiring voter identification to vote is not easy to mitigate with an election two months out especially since many people don't have ID for solid reasons.  But it is work we can do now as long as we find out about it. One voter we've come across in the last 3 weeks knocking doors in Texas didn't have a valid ID because she believed she could never obtained a birth certificate.  The hospital and/or office that would have kept her initial birth certificate had burned down years before and all the birth records were destroyed.  Moreover in discussing this with her we learned that she wasn't actually born in a hospital but it was the hospital that was in charge of providing her birth certificate.  She has voted in the past but the new requirements are making it increasingly difficult to do so.  She believes that her vote wasn't counted in the last election because of the ID requirements. We have started the process of getting her the necessary voter identification.  The sad thing is because she was not born in a hospital this lady didn't want to tell anyone why she didn't have it.  The shame that these laws create in people who no fault of their own is just as oppressive as the placement of law enforcement vehicles at the entrance of polling places in African-American communities. What is so interesting to me about this example is that she told us she was responding to the message "Democrats Care!"  If Democrats cared so much why hadn't anyone helped her get her papers?  Well we do care and we will get her her papers.  And this woman will benefit not only from being able to vote but now she can travel through the border security checkpoint that is 50 miles up the road from her through which she was afraid to travel because of her lack of photo ID. From past experience in Texas getting all the paperwork etc needed to get people photo IDs has averaged more than $300.  It's not just time-consuming and meticulous work it cost more than I know I expected.  Because we (the organizers around Hope Springs from Field PAC not the pac itself) have been involved in Texas voter efforts in the past we have contacts of volunteers who were willing to help this woman with this issue but as we continue to knock on doors we could quickly overwhelm those we know.  If you are interesting in helping Democratic voters who are effected by these kinds of paperwork issues please leave me a DM. The easiest thing that any of us can do though is to contribute.  We realize not everyone can just as not everyone has the patience knowledge and skillset to walk people through the process of obtaining a photo id.  But if you support our grassroots efforts to protect the vote especially in minority communities please chip in: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/voterprotection
