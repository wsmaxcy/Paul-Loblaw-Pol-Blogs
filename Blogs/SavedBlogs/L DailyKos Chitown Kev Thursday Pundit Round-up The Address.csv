L, Thursday Pundit Round-up: The Address, Chitown Kev, 2021-04-29, Good morning everyone...taking it a little easy this morning. Dan Balz of the Washington Post writes that a theme of President Biden’s address was an overturning of the policies and governing philosophies of former President Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s small-government philosophy resulted in a decades-long squeeze on the federal government especially domestic spending and on tax policies that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans. If Biden ultimately gets his way legislatively and that is a big question mark those policies would be replaced with ones that would directly address long-standing economic racial and gender inequities that have only become more apparent during the coronavirus pandemic. Biden had to wait nearly 50 years to achieve his dream of becoming president. In office he is operating as if he has no time to spare. Throughout his first 100 days and again on Wednesday night the presentation of his agenda shows he believes there is an urgent need to act and an opportunity to do so but that he has limited time to get it done. Alex Ward of Vox notes that President Biden’s overarching theme in last night’s address to a joint session of Congress was a defense of democracy over authoritarianism. It’s this idea that seems to animate everything Biden does. Whether it’s pushing trillion-dollar economic and infrastructure plans at home or especially working to outcompete Beijing abroad the president’s main theme is that democracy is the best form of government despite all the others. For some experts it’s the right note to strike. “China is arguing that their brand of authoritarian capitalism is predictable and produces prosperity whereas the American model is socially divisive politically unpredictable and economically reckless” Kori Schake the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC told me. “He’s right” to keep bringing the issue up she added. Indeed it makes sense for Biden to rally around this idea. Former President Trump attacked American democracy and often sided with foreign dictators so championing democracy conveniently allows for a political separation between the two. Instead of appealing to rationality in an irrational and polarized time the notion of boosting America’s democracy might calm partisan passions. And at a fundamental level a functioning US is good for its international standing. Michael McGough of the Los Angeles Times says that we should not allow Republicans to play any sort of “whataboutism” with regard to their possible culpability in the 1/6 attack on the Capitol. The killing of Evans on April 2 when a driver rammed into him and another Capitol Police officer is arguably connected to the Jan. 6 riots because both incidents implicate Capitol security measures. But the idea that a Jan. 6 commission would look at “political violence across the country and in this city” is bizarre. Why not throw in Benghazi Whitewater and the John F. Kennedy assassination while we’re at it? This whataboutism isn’t surprising coming from McCarthy. After a brief moment in which he acknowledged that Trump bore responsibility for the riots the Republican leader has been engaged in a cringe-making effort to cozy up to the former president including by traveling to Mar-a-Lago to enlist Trump’s aid in the GOP’s drive to regain control of the House next year. In Sunday’s interview with Wallace McCarthy took revisionist history to a new level saying: “I was the first person to contact [Trump] when the riots was going on. He didn’t see it. What he ended the call was saying — telling me he’ll put something out to make sure to stop this. And that’s what he did he put a video out later.” His assertion that Trump had been unaware of the riots strains credulity; a timeline assembled by the New York Times suggests Trump was well aware of the chaos by the time they spoke. And as for Trump putting out a video later Wallace aptly replied: “Quite a lot later. And it was a pretty weak video.” Nina Burleigh of The Nation writes about the 1918 flu epidemic the power of memory and how it compares to today’s COVID-19 pandemic. When America reached the half-million-dead mark from Covid-19 at the end of February reports compared the number to our war dead. The pandemic had by then killed more Americans than had died in World War I World War II and the Vietnam War combined—and it wasn’t done with us yet. But the Covid dead had not marched into battle. They had gone off to their jobs as bus drivers and nurses and store clerks or hugged a grandchild or been too close to a health-care worker who arrived at a nursing home via the subway. Every November 11th on Veterans Day our world still remembers and celebrates the moment World War I officially ended. But the last great pandemic the influenza epidemic of 1918-1920 that became known as “the Spanish flu” (though it wasn’t faintly Spain’s fault since it probably began in the United States) which infected half a billion people on a far less populated planet killing an estimated 50 million to 100 million of them—including more soldiers than were slaughtered in that monumental war—fell into a collective memory hole. *** That virus unlike Covid-19 mainly killed young healthy people. But there are eerie even uncanny similarities between the American experience of that pandemic and this one. In the summer of 1919 just after the third deadly wave American cities erupted in race riots. As with the summer of 2020 the 1919 riots were sparked by an incident in the Midwest: a Chicago mob stoned a black teenager who dared to swim off a Lake Michigan beach whites had unofficially declared whites-only. The boy drowned and in the ensuing week of rioting 23 blacks and 15 whites died. The riots spread across the country to Washington D.C. and cities in Nebraska Tennessee Arkansas and Texas with Black veterans who had served in World War I returning home to second-class treatment and an increase in Ku Klux Klan lynchings. Christopher Schelin of The Conversation notes some interesting similarities between old Baptist disciplines and “cancel culture.” From their origins in the 17th century through the late 19th century Baptists in America – most especially in the South – vigorously engaged in the practice of church discipline. Believers who had allegedly sinned would be accused tried and then convicted by their peers – the verdict was decided by democratic vote. While the repentant were restored to fellowship the obstinate were excommunicated or to borrow from today’s parlance “canceled.” Baptists prosecuted their own for a panoply of offenses including alcoholism social dancing and erroneous beliefs. They disciplined white males for mistreating their wives and slaves but they also disciplined wives for disobedience to their husbands. At its height the church discipline generated a massive turnover in membership. The historian Gregory Wills in his book “Democratic Religion” claims that Baptists in Georgia excommunicated more than 40000 members in the years preceding the Civil War. Church discipline relaxed over time and essentially disappeared by the end of the 1920s. But some Southern Baptists today aim to restore its place in congregational life as a bulwark against what they see as “moral relativism” and a way to address what they see as offenses such as homosexuality sex outside of marriage and false teaching. At first glance evangelical disciplinarians and progressive “cancelers” may seem worlds apart. Yet I believe they share certain key features. They both express what can be described as a purity ethic that aims to root out behaviors deemed to be harmful from the body politic. I don’t entirely agree with Schelin; for one there’s the false moral equivalence in the nature of the offenses between the two. There’s also usually some community that the one who is “canceled” nowadays can return to unlike in earlier Baptist times. I do think that he is correct to note religious antecedents in some modern secular behaviors though. Finally today the Angry Grammarian of Philadelphia Inquirer notes the insidious use of the passive voice in the police communications of the death of George Floyd. In the readout of the George Floyd killing the police start in active voice: “Officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded. … Two officers arrived and located the subject.” So far so good. After that the cops are mostly done with active voice. Their victim — not so much. “[Floyd] was ordered to step from his car.” The passive voice gives no indication that the police were the ones ordering but for Floyd they spare no active verbs: “After he got out he physically resisted officers” — a claim that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey would later say was not true. The next sentence uses a related method of weakening writing: the verb to be. Many sentences that use verbs such as be were am and was can become stronger and more direct by replacing those be verbs with active verbs. The report says: “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” If employing active verbs that would become: “Officers handcuffed the suspect and knelt on his neck which caused medical distress.” More concise more descriptive more accurate. But to no one’s surprise the police report chose the former option. Everyone have a good morning!
