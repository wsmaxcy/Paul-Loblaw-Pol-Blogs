L, President Biden DID Meet His Vaccination Goals, John Amato, 2021-07-06, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Months ago President Biden set a goal for Covid vaccinations.  He wanted every government level from Federal to State and local to push toward this goal with competency and diligence. He hoped to distribute the vaccines to the entire country and specifically that by July 4 weekend 70% of the population would be vaccinated.   At this point news reports say 67% of the population has had at least one shot so hosts of the Sunday Shows are calling that a target he missed? Meet the Press: Face The NationMARK STRASSMANN: What a difference a year makes? Two-thirds of American adults have had at least one shot of the vaccine. That's shy of President Biden's goal of seventy percent by July fourth. But it is also close enough. ABC's This Week So will that goal ever be met? Raddatz asked Jeff Zients White House Covid response coordinator: MSNBC and CNN also have made similar claims.  But again the media can't be bothered to dig even a little deeper to understand that President Biden did NOT miss his target but the Republican anti-vaxxers did. In a normal world where every American doesn't want to be infected or infect another person with a deadly virus they would make sure to get vaccinated. But in the Republican world of Fox News and QAnon conspiracy theories reality goes by the board. In a new poll by the Washington Post and ABC News President Biden is a 60% approval rating on handling the coronavirus. It should be much higher but that's still a good mark. The poll shows that while there is room for growth in vaccinations going well beyond the 70 percent target could prove difficult. Nine percent of those surveyed say they either definitely or probably will get vaccinated at some point in the future. But nearly 3 in 10 (29 percent) say they are not likely to get vaccinated including 20 percent saying they will definitely not do so. The 29 percent who say they are not likely to take a vaccine compares with 24 percent who said that in April. The survey finds that 86 percent of Democrats have received at least one shot of a vaccine compared with 45 percent of Republicans. Another 7 percent of Democrats say they are likely to do so compared with 4 percent of Republicans. 38 percent of Republicans overall saying they will definitely not get shots against the virus. How can you achieve a high mark when Republicans are refusing to take the vaccination? The lead should be "Republicans are failing America" not "Biden missed his 70% vaccination mark." Biden didn't fall short of the goal.  Look at the map of vaccines. looks like the electoral map. the Rs are not getting vaccinated. never in my life did I imagine that getting a vaccine or taking precautions to stop the spread of an illness would be political.

It's sad but unsurprising.It didn't need to be this way. pic.twitter.com/reCC2L5mje — SconnieDeer (@MrBones1987) June 7 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
