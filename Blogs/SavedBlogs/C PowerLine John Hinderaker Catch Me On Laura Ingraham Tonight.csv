C, Catch Me On Laura Ingraham Tonight, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-16, I will be on the Laura Ingraham TV show on Fox News tonight at around 9:20 Central 10:20 Eastern talking about the Derek Chauvin trial. Please tune in there is much to say and time will be short. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
