C, Catch Me On Laura Ingraham Tonight, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-20, I will be on the Laura Ingraham show on Fox News tonight at 10 Eastern 9 Central talking about the Chauvin verdict. Alan Dershowitz and I will be on at the top of the hour. I think the focus will be on Chauvin’s chance of a successful appeal but that could change by show time. The only way to know for sure is to tune in! I will post my thoughts on the verdict here in much more depth tomorrow. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
