L, Is there a song that just after hearing a few words of it you start to sing it and cannot shake it?, CameronProf, 2021-07-07, I admit I sometimes listen to one or two songs too many times. :)  Basically anything from my favorites: Bette Midler and Devo I have listened to many times in an endless loop.  But there is one song above all others that as soon as I hear the first few words I start to belt it out and it gets stuck as an ear worm for days.  If you are younger you might not get this clue or have the same reaction I do but here it goesâ€¦  Some people call me Maurice... Is there a song for you that causes the same results?
