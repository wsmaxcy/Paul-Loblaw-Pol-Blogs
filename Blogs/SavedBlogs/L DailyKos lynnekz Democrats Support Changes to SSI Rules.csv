L, Democrats Support Changes to SSI Rules, lynnekz, 2021-04-21, For those of you who don’t get the Good News Roundup this morning niftywriter included a section about a letter some congressional democrats sent to President Biden and Vice President Harris asking them to include some pretty big changes to SSI in the upcoming American Families Plan.  You can read the whole letter here (Sorry I couldn’t figure out how to embed the actual letter).  The proposed changes will really make a difference in the lives of many disabled citizens.  I am excited about this because my daughter is autistic and we are currently in the process of applying for SSI for her.  You have no idea how dishearted I was reading the rules.  It practically guarantees a life of poverty or less with no way to get out or save for anything.  You basically need to subsist check to check.  For those of you who have first hand knowledge either because you get SSI or you have a friend or family member who does you know what a difference this will make.   Please take a minute to read the letter and contact your congressmen to thank them if they are already supporting the changes or encourage them to do so if they aren’t. It may not hurt to drop President Biden and VP Harris a line as well telling them you support the proposed changes.
