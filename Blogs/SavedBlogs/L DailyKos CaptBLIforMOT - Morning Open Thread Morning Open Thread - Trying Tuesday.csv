L, Morning Open Thread - Trying Tuesday, CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-07-06, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. Today we can explore new ways to be good humans (per Dijit’s direction).  There are days when you don’t feel like interacting and that is okay.  You can stand by or sit down to share in the company of others.  No pressure here.  Blurt out some thought if you feel the urge.   Join us please. I have been jumping through the legal hoops of the system lately.  Had I known that circus was so difficult I would not have avoided getting my “required documentation”.   But I am a stubborn creature willing to be a unique side-show attraction.  I will describe my working method of invisibility to government red tape right after this song.   I don’t have a cell phone.  I haven’t had a gas or credit card since 1999.  I haven’t enrolled for a store account (Sears Home Depot etc.) for the same period of time.  I have kept an AT&T land line (in my name) since 1990 and the same car insurance with State Farm since 1980.  I don’t own property but pay my tags license and taxes on my motorcycle and truck.  I am a registered voter. This should be enough to identify me but even with an active library card it is not.   I filed for Medicare Part A when I turned 65.  I tried to enroll on line.  My application was rejected because my identity could not be verified.  I finally talked with Romondo (IRS agent in Tamp Fla.) over the phone.  This helpful man quizzed me on every aspect of my history.   He was convinced after I told him my yearly salary from the first job I ever had.  In 1972 I earned $364.00 and was proud to get it.  He thought I was strange but truly the person I professed to be.   Here’s what I have learned.  Social Security matches your history to Equifax to “E-Verify” people.  So no current credit history no financial media contacts and no record of assets means you’re an invisible member of society.   Shame on all of us that fall into this category.    In summation I will be getting my new card in the mail (six to eight weeks from the date of the phone call with Romondo).  My next task is to file for my Veteran Admin. id card.  Wish me luck. ** I’d like to take the time to invite everyone to review the Art Expo by the talented members of DKos.  Here is a link to the event.  Enjoy all the fine work. www.dailykos.com/...
