C, Few more things part three, markvol, 2020-11-07, “He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.” This is more like he passed laws to make law in his favor and not for the public good or need. Passing laws to prohibit free speech except in “Safe Zones” that don’t really exist or laws to restrict rights like the 2nd Amendment are good examples and this has long lasting and far reaching consequences. Why is it that the National Firearms Act of 1934 is still around? Oh! For the protection of us citizens to be kept from being riddled by bullets from a machine gun. Yeh right. The only documented use of a machine gun being used by a person lawfully authorized to have that type of weapon is a Chicago Cop many decades ago. Seems like we just let the left trample all over us about guns doesn’t it? Hundreds more examples but time is short and my typing skills aren’t much. “He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.” I equate this to “I’ll protect my land by passing laws so that you can’t damage but you’re on your own.” Gavin Newsome and his wineries and southern California beaches sound familiar? “He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.” We haven’t seen much of this but don’t rule it out. The left is petty enough to try this. Some have even suggested that we separate the federal agencies and scatter them all around the country which sounds pretty similar but may be useful in trashing needless bureaucracies. In the end we might be the one to use this. “He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.” We wanted to grow our future country the King was having none of that. Too many to have to rule over. The left just wants to have absolute power for it’s own sake. The heck with us pesky peasants. Side note. Abortion is all about population control and is specifically steered to particular race with the intent of controlling them until extinction according to the founder Margaret Sanger who spoke at KKK rallies. “He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.” Basic self determination guided by the rule of law. Republicans want to be left alone while the left refuses to accept anything less than control over everyone. The left is a monarchy of sorts. “He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.” Ownership of the judiciary is something our Constitution is struggling to maintain free from. The left wishes to use the judiciary to make their control absolute. Judicial activism is the dirty side exposing that will to dominate and control by. When you hear someone say the Constitution lives and breathes the original meaning of the document is about to get re-defined into something close to social justice or identity group favoritism until the mob is sated and it is always temporary because the mob is always re-forming into a new group. Give the left some more time and the Constitution will not exist if this is allowed to continue. “He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance.” The Tax Man yeh the tax ma- an. Thanks to the Beatles for reminding me. Good place to stop beside my eyes are burning enough. Is anyone seeing a pattern yet? To be continued…
