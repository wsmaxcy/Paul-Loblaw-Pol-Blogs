L, 'Clueless' Jim Jordan's Attack On Biden Backfires Spectacularly On Twitter, Ed Mazza, 2021-06-22, Rep. Jim Jordan‚Äôs name was trending¬†Monday night on Twitter... and once again it was for all the wrong reasons.¬† The Ohio Republican attempted to pin a recent rise in gas prices on President Joe Biden:¬† Average gas price:June 2020: $2.21June 2021: $3.07President Biden‚Äôs economy! As Jordan‚Äôs critics on Twitter were quick to point out his tweet fails to mention that widespread shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic last year dramatically reduced travel and with it demand for gas. That caused prices to plunge.¬† Many of Jordan‚Äôs critics were happy to offer a lesson in recent history. More than a few also delivered some blunt reminders of his own recent past in which he has been accused of ignoring molestation allegations against Ohio State University‚Äôs wrestling team doctor during his time as an assistant coach there. Jordan denies those charges but several athletes¬†have corroborated the story.¬†¬† Cause of                           Touchinggas price hike                  kids                              ü§ù              Ignored by Jim Jordan https://t.co/iLZHETF7it u familiar with supply n demand God this man is clueless. Prices were down back in June 2020 because fewer people were driving thanks to Trump's botched job of controlling the virus. And actually gas prices aren't nearly as high as they should be. https://t.co/gVKwWo4Rcq Airline tickets were also a bargain when people weren't going anywhere. https://t.co/K1M3yhPtrx Gas got down to $2.14 under Obama. Did you vote for him? I was commuting less in June 2020 than I do now can't quite remember why. https://t.co/VykoEYZgRL Things ignored by Jim Jordan:- The real cause of the gas price rise- Sexual abuse allegations at Ohio State University https://t.co/XSMODcnS4s Demand for coffins is way down tho https://t.co/Q2j5vqCrmj Last year no one was driving because we were in the middle of a pandemic but much like the abuse at Ohio State Jim Jordan is pretending it didn't happen. https://t.co/KTgDGBNxCS The GOP has found its midterm message: Things were so much better during the height of the pandemic. https://t.co/ftPj4wiufx GOP Congressman Wants America To Go Back To Good Old Days Of Pandemic That Killed Millions https://t.co/Wsm042UDJH June 2020: Nobody working travelling or shopping because Republicans like @Jim_Jordan led by Donald Trump destroyed the economy through conspiracy theories and incompetence.  But hey gas was cheap. I'll take Biden's economy any day. https://t.co/lGkHUeLuUV Gosh what was going on last summer? https://t.co/Fgd5e2laMI
