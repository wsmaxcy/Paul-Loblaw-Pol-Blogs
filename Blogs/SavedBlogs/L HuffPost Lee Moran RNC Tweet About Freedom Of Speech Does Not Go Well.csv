L, RNC Tweet About 'Freedom Of Speech' Does Not Go Well, Lee Moran, 2021-05-08, Twitter users took the Republican National Committee¬†to task on Friday over a post about freedom of speech. ‚ÄúFreedom of speech should not be a partisan issue‚Äù the RNC declared. ‚ÄúBig Tech should be held accountable.‚Äù Freedom of speech should not be a partisan issue. Big Tech should be held accountable. Commenters interpreted the post as the RNC attacking the banning of ex-President Donald Trump from social media platforms following his incitement of the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Facebook‚Äôs Oversight Board a company-appointed independent panel on Wednesday upheld the network‚Äôs decision to ban Trump in the wake of the insurrection ‚Äï but said the website must review the decision within six months. Is A.I. tweeting for the @GOP ?Feels like artificial intelligence at work. Almost human sentimentality but still not quite there yet.The @GOP will have to wait for tech to advance to connect with humans. What branch of the U.S. government is Facebook? Not understanding Freedom of Speech shouldn't be a partisan issue either but here we are. Big Tech is privately owned! If a bakery can't be forced to bake a cake for a same sex wedding Twitter FB etc can't be forced to provide a platform for RWNJs to spew their lies and hate! You can't have it both ways! Cult. As should the @GOP.     Glad we agree The @GOP is the solid undeniable winner of the race to the bottom. Remember who passed the law that allows businesses to refuse service to anyone. Freedom to vote should not be a partisan issue.  The GOP should be held accountable. As should @FoxNews Sound like the @Gop just wants to yell "FIRE!" in a crowded theatre. It isn‚Äôt a freedom of speech issue. It‚Äôs a corporate decision based on users who will (and have) violated the terms of service. If you‚Äôre on twitter Facebook or YouTube you agree to abide by their terms of service with the understanding that violation can result in banishment. Note ... it does not say Facebook. pic.twitter.com/pzmOA3wuoK Interesting to see the @GOP account begging for more regulation ü§î Insurrection against the United States government is not a partisan issue. Or it wasn't until January 6 2021. https://t.co/Ei6RCvM3Gr The GOP knows nothing about holding accountability And since when does the GOP try to influence businesses?The GOP is truly lost https://t.co/bnp0T2Gmsl Trump got banned from Twitter & Facebook after years of flagrant ignored violations of user terms that no on else would have survived. Banned only after he fabricated a stolen election lie to cover up the fact that he's a loser  attempted a coup & led an insurrection https://t.co/TMyXDCT1JD No one's forcing you to be on social media. It's not a prerequisite to life. They're private companies with rules. If I went in to a bar and started spouting nonsense like your cult leader i'd be tossed out for good. Follow the rules or leave. Simple. https://t.co/9wEZrZN5jI Tell me you don‚Äôt understand freedom of speech without telling me... https://t.co/ld3zZoHioo Telling the big lie that incited an insurrection should not be a partisan issue. Donald Trump should be held accountable. https://t.co/s58X5dmL44 Then stop trying to oust Liz Cheney!!Let her speak!!!Oh wait.You only like cancel culture when you guys are doing it.#Hypocrisy https://t.co/cXU32cFIKy Following a company‚Äôs ToS shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. Inciting insurrection should not be a partisan issue.  Keep those that do it off of social media. Let me count thy ways allowing Trump back on social media helps America or Americans.......................
