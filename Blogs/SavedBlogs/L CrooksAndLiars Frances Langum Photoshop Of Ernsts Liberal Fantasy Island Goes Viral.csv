L, Photoshop Of Ernst's 'Liberal Fantasy Island' Goes Viral, Frances Langum, 04-29-21, Joni Ernst and her Senate staff thought it would be a great idea to portray the Democrat's "agenda" -- some of which she obviously made up -- as a "Liberal Fantasy Island" complete with a placard to illustrate her speech. Bad idea Joni.   The agenda items she listed as "liberal fantasies"  were  ‚Ä¢ Defunding Police‚Ä¢ Abolishing Ice‚Ä¢ Green New Deal‚Ä¢ Supreme Court Packing‚Ä¢ D.C. Statehood Don't threaten me with a good time Senator!   But the win of the day came from a talented photoshopper Keaton Patti  who altered Joni's placard to include "banning lasagna" and "sex blimps."  wtf even are some of these??????? pic.twitter.com/cRpp1qFkXR ‚Äî Keaton Patti (@KeatonPatti) April 28 2021 Several tweeters thought this was the real thing and I can't blame them given the lack of cogent thinking on the Right.   Wait is this a real thing or a joke I cannot even tell anymore these days ‚Äî Devin (@NalgeneGuy) April 28 2021 Thank you. The fact that I was only 70% sure this was parody tells you everything about Republicans these days ‚Äî Y√¢rs Tr√ºlyüç• (@AlbinoRhino777) April 28 2021 And many want to make a double rock album out of the Sex Blimp/Lasagna concepts.
