I do that between the time we load untilÂ the ferryâ€™s departure just a few minutes. Hereâ€™s a view of the dock from the upper deck: The cormorants used to nestÂ prolifically on the dolphins sinceÂ the timeÂ in the 1990s when the old wooden pilings were replaced with these steel versions. Washington State Ferries has never liked their nestings â€”Â the smell mostly plus all the cleanup necessary in the off season. Theyâ€™ve employed a variety of tactics most of which didnâ€™t work very well from netting (which trapped and killed a bunch) to steel bars to hazing to (my favorite) kites on sticks that looked like eagles soaring. These days theyâ€™ve installed grills over most of the places they used to nest which excludes them effectively. But even the spots on top where they used to nest are empty this year. Weâ€™re not there often or long enough to see everything going on but thereâ€™s clearly been some change. I saw maybe half a dozen nests compared to 30 â€”Â 40 in earlier years. They are all tucked under the top in the irregular spacesÂ that would be hard to cover up. The cormorants are in breeding plumage whether nesting or not. Thatâ€™s a red face white rump patches and glowing iridescent plumage.   (Sidebar: M.V.Â Chelan is tied up at the broken-boat slip on the left note how the bridge is Â only big enough to walk across unlike the car loading slip between us. Grrrrrâ€¦the Suquamish brought in to replace it had to do Sea Trials Tuesday morningÂ which delayed our departure from the island by an hour which then meant I was late 15 min. to my appt nearly missed it. But at least I got in; they canceled all the later appts since their AC broke down and it was 86Â° in the operating room. Bad enough for me but worse for the doc and nurses who have to wear lead lined aprons since theyâ€™re working with a fluoroscope all day long. They called my house earlier that morning hoping to cancel my appt but we were already gone: have to leave the house at 8:45amÂ for a 1pm appt. Got home at 7pm. Could have been worse though. On Sunday when the Chelan broke down we wouldnâ€™t have gotten off at all. No ferries ran from the island to the mainland between 8:30amÂ and 6pm and there are always a ton of tourists returning home on Sundays.Â We donâ€™t even try for morning appts since the two early boats only take a handful of cars â€”Â Â you have to put your car in line the night before but only after the last boat has come and gone usually 12:30-1am since the boats in summer are always late. Weâ€™re still on the winter schedule with limited boats due to covid-reduced crew available. All of this is full disclosure for anyone thinking itâ€™s all nirvana living on an island! Going off island for anything including essential medical appointments is a gigantic unpredictable boondoggle) Anyway back to birds â€”Â Â   The cormorant situationÂ looked very similar the last time we went over on June 3. They were mostlyÂ perched and fishing with few nests. There was one difference though. Perched on a neighboring dolphin:   Itâ€™s a possibilityÂ eagles areÂ the reason there isnâ€™t much nesting this year. But there have always been eagles around here. They prey on herons gulls alcids anyone around. Partly cloudy and COOL in the PNW islands yay! Never been so happy to haveÂ cool summer weather after the extreme heat last weekend. Very dry though.
