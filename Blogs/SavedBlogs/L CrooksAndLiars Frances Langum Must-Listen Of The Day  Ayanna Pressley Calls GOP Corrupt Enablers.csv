L, Must-Listen Of The Day:  Ayanna Pressley Calls GOP 'Corrupt Enablers', Frances Langum, 2021-05-13, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts knew exactly the answer she would get.  At the House Oversight Committee hearing on the January 6 insurrection Pressley asked Trump's "Acting AG" (yeah) whether the government under Trump treated the Black Lives Matter protests of Summer 2020 differently than the January 6 insurrection.   "Was it different for Black Lives Matter than it was on January sixth yes or no?" Of course Jeffrey Rosen avoided a direct answer:  "I think we're talking about very different situations." Pressley reclaimed her time.  Chris Hayes asked her to explain the difference and what followed was everything you need to know about "the difference."   Pressley concluded by noting that "one of our colleagues today said that what happened was no different than tourists coming in the Capitol milling about!"   Also this:  I’ll keep asking about who removed all panic buttons from the office of Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley until we finally get some answers. — Ricky Davila (@TheRickyDavila) May 11 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
