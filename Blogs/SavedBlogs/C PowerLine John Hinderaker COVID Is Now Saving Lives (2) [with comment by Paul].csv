C, COVID Is Now Saving Lives (2) [with comment by Paul], John Hinderaker, 2021-05-05, More precisely fewer Americans are now dying than would be the case if the Wuhan virus did not exist. Total mortality in the U.S. per this CDC chart is sinking like a stone and is now below demographic projections:  The last two weeks of data are incomplete but the point is obvious. A large majority of “covid deaths” were people who were both elderly and already very sick. My own review of data from thousands of death certificates in Minnesota confirms that in most cases given the number of severe conditions itemized as contributors to a “covid death”–i.e one in which the word “covid” appears on the death certificate–it seems remarkable that the person was still alive at all.  I think the mortality statistics over the next couple of years will confirm that in most cases people who died with “covid” on their death certificates would have died in any event in a matter of months or perhaps a year or two. This is why we are now seeing mortality dip below demographic norms: people who otherwise would have died in April 2021 died in say October 2020 instead. If this is the case it will expose the irrationality of devastating the lives of younger and healthy people through shutdowns school closings and mask mandates while those who were at meaningful risk were almost exclusively those who as one doctor put it had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. PAUL ADDS: It is estimated that around 600000 Americans have died from the coronavirus. Around 235000 of them were under the age of 75. More than 100000 of them were under the age of 65. I doubt that the coronavirus has saved a single American life.
