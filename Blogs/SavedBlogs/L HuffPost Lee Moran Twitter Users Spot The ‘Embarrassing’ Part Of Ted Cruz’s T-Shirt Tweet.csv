L, Twitter Users Spot The ‘Embarrassing’ Part Of Ted Cruz’s T-Shirt Tweet, Lee Moran, 2021-05-07, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) trended on Twitter Thursday after he shared a screenshot that appeared to show him searching for his own name on the platform. Probably made in China. pic.twitter.com/8jSKWHQwoO Cruz a grandstanding Donald Trump sycophant was firing back at a post showing a mocking T-shirt bearing his likeness ― and the slogan “Politics in the front Insurrection in the back” ― that the critic said faded after one wash. People noticed that the search bar in Cruz’s screenshot contained the terms “tedcruz OR @tedcruz Or s…” and accused the Texas Republican of being “desperate.”  Doesn't Ted Cruz have an important job that doesn't involve searching for his own damn name on Twitter? https://t.co/fvaSxOoTay Bruh coulda just tapped the tweet and took a screenshot 😭🤣 You searched yourself and left the search bar on the screenshot? pic.twitter.com/Hb2OzcFVSy Yet another self-own by @TedCruz. This time? Searching Twitter for his own name. https://t.co/aBvD4LOFLB let's play the guessing game for what the last search term starting with 's' was pic.twitter.com/hu6C2LNtMZ Bro how often do you search yourself? The third term in the search bar is "seditionist". pathetic OR thirsty OR desperate OR https://t.co/HuEJp0CDJu pic.twitter.com/sHZPIjdriE this is so embarrassing pic.twitter.com/jmEXBvPYXa you have no idea how embarrassing that search bar is do you?
