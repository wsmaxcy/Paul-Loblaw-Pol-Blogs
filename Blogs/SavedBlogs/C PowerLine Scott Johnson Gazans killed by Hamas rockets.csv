C, Gazans killed by Hamas rockets, Scott Johnson, 2021-07-06, Alex Safian is research director of the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA). BESA Center has published his study of Gaza Palestinians killed by errant Hamas rockets fired in the recent hostilities. Here is the executive summary: Much of the coverage and commentary surrounding the fighting in May between Hamas and Israel has focused on numbers especially the much larger number of Palestinians than Israelis killed. The number of deaths is actually very low for such an intense conflict a testament to Israel’s Iron Dome and civil defense systems and its use of precision weapons and warnings aimed at minimizing Palestinian civilian deaths. Of course Hamas aims to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible but its rockets place both Israelis and Palestinians in peril because many of those rockets—in this case 680—misfire and explode inside Gaza. The death and destruction caused is of course usually blamed on Israel. The question addressed here is how many Palestinians are likely to have been killed by these errant Palestinian rockets in May. The estimate arrived at is 91 amounting to 36% of the alleged Palestinian death toll. Here is one suggestion for improvement that will not be adopted: If Hamas insists on attacking Israel the least it could do is use some of the large amounts of foreign aid it has received (for example the $2.7 billion pledged in 2014) to build as Israel has civil defenses to protect its population. Instead it has devoted almost all its efforts to attacking Israel with weapons such as rockets mortars incendiary balloons snipers and anti-tank rockets. The reason Hamas puts no effort into civil defense is obvious. Civilian deaths incidental to hostilities are instrumental to their purposes. The organs of the mainstream media — the New York Times the Washington Post the Associated Press and all the rest — are eager to attribute all manner of fault to Israel. Safian is doing the work they decline to do. They prefer to serve Hamas in their own way. Unfortunately it is impossible to embarrass them. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
