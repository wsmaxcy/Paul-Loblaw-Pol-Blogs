Joe Biden wants you to believe in American democracy In his speech to Congress President Joe Biden echoed FDR with a call to do big things and restore faith in America. […] Like Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the start of the Great Depression Biden took office at a time of crisis and has tried to use that crisis to reshape government. Biden’s team invited the comparisons to FDR too — just about any sitting Democratic president wants his agenda compared to one of the most successful political projects in US history. […] What Biden is really seeking to build with his policy agenda in other words isn’t just bridges roads and child care but the supports that prop up a modern democratic welfare state: the public’s faith in government itself. If we are to truly restore the soul of America then we need to protect the sacred right to vote.Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away.  5 winners and 3 losers from President Biden’s first congressional address President Joe Biden struck a notably optimistic tone in his first speech before a joint session of Congress coming after a long pandemic year that has been marked with isolation loss and for far too many Americans death. “After just 100 days — I can report to the nation: America is on the move again” Biden said during his speech. “Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.” […] Biden spent a good chunk of his speech talking about what he already accomplished including signing a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package into law. But he also previewed the next major phase of his presidency introducing a two-pronged economic package: The $2.25 trillion American Jobs Plan which invests in building roads and schools green energy jobs and supplementing long-term care; and the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan which creates a paid family and sick leave program dedicates billions to affordable child care universal pre-kindergarten and two years of free community college. Biden also addressed economic competition with China and told the US Senate to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act by next month. But the biggest emphasis of Biden’s speech by far was job creation. Trickle-down economics has never worked.It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.  Michael Collins ‘Third Man’ of the Moon Landing Dies at 90 Michael Collins who piloted the Apollo 11 spacecraft Columbia in orbit 60 miles above the moon while his crewmates Neil Armstrong and Col. Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the lunar surface died on Wednesday at a hospice facility in Naples Fla. He was 90. A statement released by Mr. Collins’s family on Twitter said the cause was cancer. It was an epic moment of exploration an instant when the fantasy of science fiction writers became a reality. And when it transpired Lt. Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force was the loneliest man in history. I am certain if everyone could see the Earth floating just outside their windows every day would be #EarthDay.There are few things more fragile or more beautiful than Earth let’s work together today and everyday to protect our home. pic.twitter.com/XJO3RSJczw  The Republican Party Is a Grave Threat to American Democracy The hope of many conservative critics of Donald Trump was that soon after his defeat and especially in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection the Republican Party would snap back into its former shape. The Trump presidency would end up being no more than an ugly parenthesis. The [Republican Party] would distance itself from Trump and Trumpism and become a normal party once again. But that dream soon died. The Trump presidency might have been the first act in a longer and even darker political drama in which the Republican Party is becoming more radicalized. How long this will last is an open question; whether it is happening is not. Why Dead Trees Are ‘the Hottest Commodity on the Planet’ […] Since 2018 a one-two punch of environmental harms worsened by climate change has devastated the lumber industry in Canada the largest lumber exporter to the United States. A catastrophic and multi-decade outbreak of bark-eating beetles followed by a series of historic wildfire seasons have led to lasting economic damage in British Columbia a crucial lumber-providing province. Americans have in effect made a mad dash for lumber at the exact moment Canada is least able to supply it. SEC Enforcement Chief Alex Oh Resigns Days After Taking Job The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s new enforcement chief abruptly resigned Wednesday citing a complication in a case from her prior legal career an early and significant setback in Chairman Gary Gensler’s tenure running the Wall Street regulator. Alex Oh’s surprise move announced just a week after she got the job means Gensler won’t have his preferred pick leading what’s arguably the agency’s most important division. Melissa Hodgman who was previously serving as acting director of the enforcement division will return to that role the SEC said in a statement. […] Before joining the SEC Oh was a partner at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison where her corporate clients included Exxon Mobil Corp. In that role she was defending the oil company against two-decade-old allegations that it supported killings and tortures in Indonesia court documents show. Google Is Saving Over $1 Billion a Year by Working From Home With Covid-19 restrictions lifting more people are booking trips and hotels online which is very good for Google’s advertising business. Google’s employees however are working from home and not traveling as much on the company dime -- and that’s also good for its business. During the first quarter Google parent Alphabet Inc. saved $268 million in expenses from company promotions travel and entertainment compared to same period a year earlier “primarily as a result of COVID-19” according to a company filing. On an annualized basis that would be more than $1 billion. Prosecutors Are Now Calling The Michigan Kidnapping Plot An Act Of Domestic Terrorism The men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer were engaged in domestic terrorism federal prosecutors now claim signaling a potential shift in how the Justice Department is handling one of its highest-profile cases involving anti-government activities. Last October the Justice Department made headlines around the world when officials announced they had foiled a plot to break into the governor’s vacation home snatch her and spirit her away — possibly by boat — then put her on trial for being “a tyrant.” Six men were indicted on federal kidnapping charges while eight more were charged in Michigan state court with providing support to the plot. Now in a new indictment filed in the Western District of Michigan early on Wednesday a grand jury has added three additional charges to the federal case: conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction possession of an unregistered destructive device and possession of an unregistered short-barreled rifle. Previously the sole federal count had been kidnapping conspiracy. The Men Accused Of Killing Ahmaud Arbery Are Now Facing Federal Hate Crime Charges The three Georgia men charged with murder in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery are now facing federal hate crime charges as well the Department of Justice announced Wednesday. The federal charges came more than a year after the 25-year-old Black man was followed by the three white men while he was jogging in Brunswick Georgia told to stop at gunpoint and shot. No arrests or charges were initially filed after Arbery's death on Feb. 23 2020. It wasn't until cellphone video of the shooting became public that an outside prosecutor assigned to review the case announced it would be presented to a grand jury. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation later offered to assist in the case. Trump supporter found guilty of threatening to kill members of Congress after Jan. 6 insurrection Brendan Hunt a Trump supporter who called for killing members of Congress days after the Jan. 6 insurrection was found guilty Wednesday of making a death threat against elected officials. The jury which took about three hours to reach its verdict found that comments Hunt made in a disturbing video posted online two days after the U.S. Capitol riot amounted to a genuine threat to murder lawmakers in Washington. He faces up to 10 years in prison. Senate votes to restore Obama-era limits on methane gas emissions The Senate voted Wednesday to restore an Obama-era regulation that imposed limits on methane leaks from oil and gas operations. The move marks both the first major congressional rebuke of former president Donald Trump’s environmental policies and a step forward for the Biden administration’s ambitious climate agenda. “We have to stop lighting the matches of methane pollution” Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) one of the bill’s sponsors said at a news conference Wednesday morning. The vote is also the first time Democrats have used the 1996 Congressional Review Act to reverse a federal regulation. The measure cleared the divided Senate by a 52 to 42 vote. It is expected to easily pass the House and would then head to President Biden’s desk. Louisville officer shot in Breonna Taylor raid retiring The Louisville police officer who fired at Breonna Taylor after being shot during the deadly raid on Taylor’s apartment is retiring. Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly is planning to retire from the Louisville Metro Police Department on June 1 police spokesperson Beth Ruoff told news outlets. Mattingly 48 … will be due his full police pension after serving more than 20 years on the department. California is primed for a severe fire season but just how bad is anybody’s guess At this point it seems like almost a given that California will see another historic fire season. A meager rainy season is in the rearview mirror. Snowpack is depleted. Vegetation and soils are parched. “All the indications are that we are heading into another really bad fire year” said Safeeq Khan assistant cooperative extension specialist of water and watershed sciences at the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. But there are still some key variables that haven’t yet taken shape. Weather events human behavior and even luck will dictate whether 2021 goes down in the record books like 2020 when California wildfires burned an area larger than the state of Connecticut. EU lawmakers approve post-Brexit trade treaty European Union leaders their British counterparts and European businesses expressed hope Wednesday that the final ratification of the post-Brexit trade deal will open a new positive era of cooperation despite the many divisive topics remaining between the former partners. After European lawmakers overwhelmingly ratified the agreement ensuring that free trade continues between the two sides without tariffs and quotas U.K. Prime minister Boris Johnson said the vote marked the “final step in a long journey providing stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners close allies and sovereign equals.” Rudy Giuliani’s Upper East Side apartment and law office raided by FBI FBI agents raided Rudy Giuliani’s Manhattan apartment and law office Wednesday seizing cellphones and computers in a dramatic escalation of an ongoing criminal investigation into the former mayor’s shady business dealings in Ukraine his attorney confirmed. The raids… are an overt sign that Manhattan federal prosecutors’ long-running investigation into Giuliani has entered a new phase. It’s also a signal the feds believe they have a strong case. Giuliani … Donald Trump’s personal lawyer is entitled to attorney-client privilege protections that can only be overcome with evidence of a crime. Covid-19: With 3.8 lakh new infections active cases cross 30 lakh The alarming rise in daily Covid-19 cases and deaths in India continued on Wednesday even as the number of active cases crossed 3 million for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. In the past 24 hours 3.79 lakh fresh cases and 3596 deaths were recorded in the country highest in a single day. […] Since the start of the second wave Maharashtra is reporting the country’s highest cases and Wednesday’s case count of 63309 was no exception.

The surface-to-air missile was believed to have been fired by Syrian air defences against Israeli jets that were bombing a site near Damascus but the path it flew initially led to speculation that Israel’s most sensitive site may have instead been a target. Canada: hummingbirds succeed in halting controversial pipeline construction Activists and protesters have tried fruitlessly for years to stop the construction of the controversial TransMountain oil pipeline in western Canada. Now a tiny hummingbird have succeeded where others have fallen short forcing construction on the multibillion-dollar project to halt for the next four months. Environment and Climate Change Canada has ordered work to stop until 21 August after the discovery of an Anna’s hummingbird nest in a tree felled during construction of the pipeline. EU accuses Russia China of COVID vaccine disinformation China and Russia are engaging in campaigns to erode trust in the European Union's coronavirus strategy as well as gin up skepticism of Western-developed coronavirus vaccines the EU's foreign service said in a report published Wednesday. The report also raised concerns that the countries are using these efforts to particularly exert influence on the Western Balkans. The findings stem from a report published by the EU External Action Service (EEAS) on disinformation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report "state-sponsored disinformation" efforts have intensified since the beginning of 2021 as vaccine rollouts have started to pick up pace around the world. UK PM Boris Johnson rattled as MPs grill him over who funded flat refurbishment  A furious Boris Johnson was grilled by the leaders of British opposition parties during parliamentary questions on Wednesday amid a row over a €70000 refurbishment of his Downing Street flat. The UK's prime minister faced MPs on the day that the country’s electoral commission launched an investigation into whether Conservative Party donors paid for the work. If they had the cost should have been declared under Britain’s law on political donations. Dominic Cummings a former aide to Johnson who left his job in 2020 has claimed that the prime minister wanted to get Conservative donors to fund the renovation of the apartment which he currently lives in with his fiancee Carrie Symonds and their baby son Wilfred. Cummings said he told Johnson that the plan was “unethical foolish possibly illegal”. In Sworn Testimony in Inauguration Scandal Case Donald Trump Jr. Made Apparently False Statements On February 11 Donald Trump Jr. sat in front of his computer for a video deposition. He swore to tell the truth. But documents and a video obtained by Mother Jones—and recent legal filings—indicate that his testimony on key points was not accurate. […] In short the attorney general has accused the Trump clan and its company of major grifting and he is looking to recover the amounts paid to the Trump Hotel so he can direct those funds to real charitable purposes. […] During his deposition Trump Jr. frequently replied “I don’t recall” and he downplayed his involvement in preparation for his father’s inauguration in January 2017. In several exchanges he made statements that are contradicted by documents or the recollections of others and that appear to be false. Video of botched elephant hunt by U.S. NRA leader sparks fury A botched elephant hunt in the Okavango Delta by a top U.S. gun lobbyist has provoked outrage among wildlife conservationists and animal rights groups sparking further controversy over plans by Southern African governments to sell licenses for hundreds of new elephant hunts. Wayne LaPierre chief executive of the National Rifle Association fired repeatedly at close range at a wounded and immobilized elephant failing to kill the animal until a friend finished the job according to a gruesome video from 2013 posted on the website of The New Yorker this week. Farmers Edge launches insurance for canola farmers experiencing extreme weather Agriculture technology provider Farmers Edge Inc. has launched an automated insurance product that will cover canola farmers if their crops are damaged by extreme heat.  The Winnipeg-based software company which uses sensors to collect data on crops and weather conditions to help farmers improve their yields will partner with Munich Reinsurance Co. of Canada to insure canola farmers at a cost of approximately $10 an acre. At first the insurance will be available in Alberta Manitoba and Saskatchewan but the company expects to expand into other markets. Farmers Edge chief executive officer Wade Barnes said current forms of crop insurance don’t protect farmers from “heat blasts” – single days of extreme heat – which can cut substantial parts of a farmer’s yield. The risks of a heat blast are likely to increase as the effects of climate change intensify. Moscow is annoyed Eastern European governments no longer turn a blind eye to assassinations by 'Unit 29155' Moscow was surprised by the Czech government's aggressive response to the discovery of Russian intelligence agents operating in the European republic a NATO military-intelligence official told Insider. The Czech response — a mass expulsion of  63 Russian "diplomats" and the repeated exposure of one of Russia's clumsier assassination squads — now threatens billions in economic investment between the two countries. Russia has invested aggressively in Czechia in the hope that the country would turn a blind eye to the spying and political-killing operations it staged out of Prague the Czechia capital our source— who agreed to speak candidly in exchange for anonymity — hinted. But the Czechia government may have run out of patience with Unit 29155 the notorious Russian assassination squad that has acted largely unfettered across Europe for several years. 'White supremacy is terrorism': Biden urges vigilance against home-grown violence after Jan. 6 attack President Joe Biden identified white supremacy as a domestic terror threat that the country must remain vigilant against in his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday. In discussing his order to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan Biden noted global terror networks have largely moved beyond the country and that white supremacists posed a bigger threat than foreign actors. "We won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism” Biden cautioned 'Alarming': World's glaciers are melting faster than ever because of global warming study says Most of Earth's glaciers are melting faster than ever because of human-caused climate change dumping about 328 billion tons of melted ice into the world's oceans each year according to a new study. In fact what was once considered to be permanent ice has declined in volume almost everywhere around the globe the study found. Half the world’s glacial loss is coming from the United States and Canada the study said.  Alaska’s melt rates are “among the highest on the planet” with the Columbia glacier retreating about 115 feet a year said study lead author Romain Hugonnet a glaciologist at the University of Toulouse in France. Iran's top diplomat speaks bluntly on nuclear deal Gen. Qasem Soleimani in leaked recording A recording of Iran's foreign minister offering a blunt appraisal of diplomacy and the limits of power within the Islamic Republic has been leaked providing a rare look inside the country's theocracy. The release of the comments by Mohammad Javad Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well. ‘There’s no rain’: Climate change threatens Iraq’s Bedouins The wind whipped relentlessly across the open deserts of Muthanna province as Ali Thajeel moved his camel herd along the rugged plains in search of greenery. Decades ago he remembered April was a time when the sandy soil turned into grazing land to allow his livestock to gain weight ahead of the scorching summer heat. But in recent years his camels had to make do with scattered patches of scruffy grass. “There’s no rain and the land is dry. The grass has turned into desert. We have to sell some animals to buy food for the rest. This is what life has become” said Thajeel his kaffiyeh pulled tightly across his face to shield it from the dry dusty air. US orders embassy staff to leave Kabul as it begins troop pullout The United States has ordered non-essential staff to leave its Kabul embassy citing increased threats as Washington prepares to end its 20-year war in Afghanistan. The order came two weeks after President Joe Biden announced that US troops currently about 2500 would leave the country by September. Meanwhile Zalmay Khalilzad Washington’s special envoy to Afghanistan warned in a Senate hearing that US aid could be slashed if a Taliban-dominated government did not respect human rights. Climate change: A small green rock's warning about our future It's an unassuming rock greenish in colour and just over 4cm in its longest dimension. And yet this little piece of sandstone holds important clues to all our futures. It was recovered from muds in the deep ocean far off the coast of modern-day West Antarctica. The scientists who found it say it shouldn't really have been there. It's what's called a dropstone a piece of ice-rafted debris. It was scraped off the White Continent by a glacier carried a certain distance in this flowing ice and then exported and discarded offshore by an iceberg. What's remarkable about this particular cobble is that researchers can say where it originated. Ghana basks in Twitter’s surprise choice as Africa HQ Twitter delivered a surprise for Africa when it said it was establishing a regional headquarters in the West African nation of Ghana triggering vigorous debate about the business environment for technology start-ups across the continent. For the social media giant its decision was based on shared values - Ghana supports "free speech online freedom and the open internet". The fact it also serves as the HQ for the African Continental Free Trade Area - established to accelerate intra-African trade and freedom of movement - seems to have cemented Ghana's appeal as a gateway to the region. China set to report first population decline in five decades China is set to report its first population decline since the famine that accompanied the Great Leap Forward Mao Zedong’s disastrous economic policy in the late 1950s that caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. The current fall in population comes despite the relaxation of strict family planning policies which was meant to reverse the falling birth rate of the world’s most populous country. The latest Chinese census which was completed in December but has yet to be made public is expected to report the total population of the country at less than 1.4bn according to people familiar with the research. In 2019 China’s population was reported to have exceeded the 1.4bn mark. Biden Nominates Harris County Texas Sheriff To Be Director Of ICE The White House announced Tuesday that President Biden is nominating as director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Sheriff Ed Gonzalez of Harris County Texas a vocal critic of elements of former President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement policies.

French Police Arrest Extremist Red Brigades Members Sought By Italy Several former members of the Red Brigades — a violent radical-left Italian terrorist group that was active in the 1970s and 1980s — were arrested Wednesday in France after years of living under de facto asylum the French government said in a statement. The seven fugitives taken into custody all but one former members of the Red Brigades were convicted of murder and kidnapping decades ago but later sought refuge in France before beginning their prison sentences. Apple reports 54% year-over-year revenue increase Apple released its Q2 2021 earnings report to investors today after the bell and it was another huge year—so huge in fact that investors are concerned it's not sustainable as the world enters a new later phase of the pandemic. Revenue for the quarter was $89.58 billion a record for the March quarter and up 54 percent year-over-year. The number surpassed investors' and analysts' predictions and expectations leading up to the report. Gross margin was 42.5 percent. Nestlé threatened with cease-and-desist over alleged illegal water use The snow hasn’t completely melted in the Sierra Nevada but most of California is already deep into a drought. Over 96 percent of the Golden State is experiencing moderate to exceptional drought compared with 36 percent last year which was the worst year for wildfires since record keeping began. Meanwhile in the San Bernardino National Forest Nestlé continues to pump hundreds of thousands of gallons a week to sell as bottled water. The folks at California’s State Water Resources Control Board aren’t amused. This week they issued a cease-and-desist order demanding that Nestlé “immediately cease all unauthorized diversions of water.” Nestlé has been pumping water from a creek that feeds the Santa Ana River which supplies a significant portion of Orange County’s drinking water. The company argues that it has water rights to the creek that date back to 1865 and while the water board admits that may be true the board says that the company has grossly overdrawn its amount  This is a fascinating honest conversation. Man.pic.twitter.com/m5ym9ImXdz  NOTHING will prepare you for the plot twist in this story below...wait for it. https://t.co/tbrgb419gJ  This speech is way edgier than standard SOTU-style speeches.Would like to have heard the discussion on including “Do you think deer wear Kevlar vests?” (Glad they included it.)  “You’re not doing enough to unify us!” shouted the failed assassins https://t.co/UXomUvNhqo  McConnell & Republicans can’t even clap for the positive impact of reducing child poverty? We must keep mobilizing the vote & make sure they never hold a majority again.
