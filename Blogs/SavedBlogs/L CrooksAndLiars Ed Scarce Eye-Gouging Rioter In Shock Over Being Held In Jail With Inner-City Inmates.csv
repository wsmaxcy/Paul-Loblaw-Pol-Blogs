L, 'Eye-Gouging' Rioter In Shock Over Being Held In Jail With 'Inner-City' Inmates, Ed Scarce, 04-11-21, Retired NYPD officer and sometime rioter Thomas Webster arrested for his role on January 6th has asked that he be moved to a jail in upstate New York. Yes I can well imagine that for a cop who used to perform high-profile security at City Hall and the New York mayoral residence it would be quite a shock to be stuck in a jail cell with hardened criminals especially of the darker 'inner-city' type. Such a shock that through his lawyer he's requested a transfer to upstate New York presumably where the inmates are not quite so dark. We brought you the story of this reprobate a couple of months ago Webster captured on video trying to gouge the eyes out of a Capitol Hill police officer. Source: Newsweek Thomas Webster a Capitol rioter who attacked a police officer with a metal pole and attempted to gouge his eyes is said to be in "shock" over being detained with people who committed "inner-city" crimes his lawyer said Friday. According to Washington Post reporter Rachel Weiner Webster's lawyer said he is being detained in a "dormitory setting" after police arrested him in connection with violently storming the U.S. Capitol building on January 6. "For a middle aged guy whose never been arrested before this has been a shock for him" his lawyer said while adding that his record outside of the attack is "sparkling." Outside of this one incident of mayhem his record is "sparkling."
