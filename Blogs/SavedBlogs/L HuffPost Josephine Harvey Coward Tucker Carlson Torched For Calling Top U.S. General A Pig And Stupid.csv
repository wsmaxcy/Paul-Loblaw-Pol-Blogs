L, 'Coward' Tucker Carlson Torched For Calling Top U.S. General 'A Pig' And 'Stupid', Josephine Harvey, 2021-06-25, Fox News host Tucker Carlson slung mud at Gen. Mark Milley the nation’s highest-ranking military officer on Thursday evening calling him “a pig” and “stupid” after the Army general defended the teaching of critical race theory in the military a day earlier. “Mark Milley is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff” the conservative personality said on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “He didn’t get that job because he’s brilliant or because he’s brave or because people who know him respect him. He is not and they definitely don’t. “Milley got the job because he is obsequious. He knows who to suck up to and he’s more than happy to do it. Feed him a script and he will read it.” After playing a clip of Milley’s comments at a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday Carlson commented that he found it “hard to believe that man wears a uniform he’s that unimpressive.” “He’s not just a pig he’s stupid” he added after a second clip. Tucker: Mark Milley is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He didn’t get that job because he’s brilliant or because he’s brave or because the people who know him respect him.

He said Wednesday that he thought it was important for members of the military to be open-minded and well-read including on the subject of critical race theory. It came in response to a suggestion from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) that the U.S. military is becoming too “woke” in part because it’s embraced teachings about the ways in which racism is embedded in societal structures. “I’ve read Mao Tse-tung. I’ve read Karl Marx. I’ve read Lenin. That doesn’t make me a communist” Milley said. “So what is wrong with understanding? Having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend?” Though Fox News often claims a mantle of American patriotism it’s not even the first time this year that Carlson has insulted service members. In March he earned rebukes from top defense leaders after he showed a pregnant woman in uniform and called it a “mockery of the U.S. military.”  Carlson faced a wave of backlash online following his comments. Critics included Rep. Ted Lieu a California Democrat; Joe Walsh a former Republican lawmaker and candidate for president; and Lincoln Project Executive Director Fred Wellman.  Remember when he was angry that kneeling during the anthem disrespected the military? Tucker Carlson is a coward who never served anything other than his own bank account. https://t.co/A3E5zHAgRu Here we see the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley being slandered by the Autocratic movements chief propagandist @TuckerCarlson with ad hominem attacks. Milley has served this country in uniform for 42 years. Disgusting. https://t.co/fzGXkG8gRL Tucker Carlson who never had the courage to serve in the military calls Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Milley a “pig” and “stupid.”I believe an overwhelming majority of my brothers and sisters in arms would agree if I said @TuckerCarlson was a cowardly piece of shit. https://t.co/NsO9cfQSw3 Dear @TuckerCarlson: Why do you hate America so much?General Mark Milley lead soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq including combat duties. He’s served in the 82nd Airborne & 5th Special Forces Group.I see that you once applied to be in the CIA. But the agency rejected you. https://t.co/J6NbLWfNjy Best way to understand Tucker Carlson's abuse of General Mark Milley tonight is as confirmation of the accuracy of the stories Gen Milley told about rebuffing ex President Trump's order for a massacre in Portland Oregon. If Ilhan Omar or AOC attacked our troops like Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham do every night would Sean Hannity blow a gasket? Well actually Tucker Carlson is lying again. Gen. Milley has served in five wars/conflicts been awarded over a dozen medals for bravery has a BA from Princeton and two MAs and is one of the most accomplished members of the military. And is well-respected. https://t.co/hokaS8Dw2Q Carlson’s full segment on Milley can be viewed below.
