L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Erin Cruz- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-19, On this date one year ago “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” first profiled Erin Cruz who was a failed candidate for U.S. Senate in 2018 in California (finishing sixth in the open primary with 4% of the vote) but was in the midst of a 2020 run to be the U.S. House Representative from California’s 36th District. Among her campaign strategies? To listen to the “legitimate concerns” of Qanon Conspiracy theorists who believe that Democrats are secretly running subterranean Devil-worshipping child abuse rings to harvest hormones from their victims. Her personal take on Q amounted to “WHOA IF TRUE”:            “There is someone out there putting information on the internet as part of QAnon. A conspiracy theory only sounds crazy until it’s proven.”      Wouldn’t you know it Cruz is a “journalist” working for the new paranoid right-wing “news” site One America News Network. This would be the same network you may have recently heard about that is noted for having less scruples or shame than Fox News while promoting conspiracy theories like the Seth Rich Conspiracy theory.Erin Cruz lost to Democratic Congressman Raul Ruiz in November not even getting past the 40% of the vote threshold. She could end up being a perennial candidate in California politics for some time as she was already planning a 2022 U.S. Senate campaign challenge for the seat formerly held by Kamala Harris while constantly unsuccessfully trying to get Gov. Gavin Newsom recalled even though by most measurables he’s been an outstanding governor so far.We won’t link to her Twitter account but suffice to say that if you wanted to be someone outraged that people on the left even exist and want to do ANY good whatsoever while portraying themselves as the victim you can go watch this ludicrous troll do nothing but that. We’re not directing anyone to the mouth of madness.       One Year Ago April 19th 2020: Erin Cruz (CA)… Original ProfileTwo Years Ago April 19th 2019: Cliff Rosenberger (OH)Three Years Ago April 19th 2018: Jeff Kruse (OR)Four Years Ago April 19th 2017: Gia Arnold (NY)Five Years Ago.
