L, Matt Gaetz’s Tweet About Defunding FBI Lasted Less Than A Minute Online, Lee Moran, 2021-06-24, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) tweeted about defunding the FBI on Wednesday then appeared to think better of it. The Florida Republican deleted a post about the agency investigating him on possible sex trafficking charges less than a minute after it went online. “If Democrats want to defund the police they should start with the FBI” wrote Gaetz reported ProPublica. Explaining the deletion of the post a spokesperson for Gaetz told Vice News he “felt it appropriate to remove a jocular tweet taken from a speech some time ago.” Gaetz who is considering a presidential bid in 2024 if ex-President Donald Trump is not in the running is under investigation in a federal sex trafficking probe for reportedly paying a teenager to cross state lines for sex. He denies doing anything wrong and claims the investigation is part of an extortion plot against him.
