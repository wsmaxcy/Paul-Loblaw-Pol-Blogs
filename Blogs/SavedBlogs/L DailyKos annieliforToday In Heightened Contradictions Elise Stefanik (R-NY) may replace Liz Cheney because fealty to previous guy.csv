L, Elise Stefanik (R-NY) may replace Liz Cheney because fealty to previous guy, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-05-05, Because she’s a moderate(sic) who believes in the cult of Trumpism. Revealing. Cheney has a more conservative record than Stefanik but that's not what matters anymore. Loyalty to Trump is the one non-negotiable trait for leading the party. https://t.co/iQ3ZgNkNIx Revisiting this @TimesUnion piece from 1/7/2021 >>Fact check: Stefanik's defense includes rejected legal claims debunked theories https://t.co/0b231eN0rY Why it doesn't matter at all that Stefanik doesn't have a conservative voting record as robust as Cheney's. https://t.co/AvlNqmi3cj BREAKING: The No. 2 House Republican is publicly calling for the removal of Rep. Liz Cheney as the party's third-ranking leader in the chamber. Rep. Steve Scalise the House GOP whip said he is backing New York GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik for Cheney's post. https://t.co/OYkCumQP6y  Cheney is a conservative Republican. She shares virtually no policy positions with President Biden and the Democrats. She has been outspoken repeatedly when she has disagreed with the new president or with Democrats in Congress. Her credentials and familial ties as the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney put her in the front ranks of the conservative movement. That is no longer good enough for Republicans. She must seemingly agree with Trump’s false characterizations of the election or remain silent in the face of those lies however damaging they might be. Those are the choices. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has begun to cut her loose. He said on “Fox & Friends” that others in the party are “concerned” about her that she’s not able to “carry out the message” for the party heading into the 2022 midterms. On a hot mic he said “I’ve had it” with her. [...] The story of the Republican Party in 2021 has been described as a battle for the party’s soul. In reality the battle is over at least for now. Cheney and Romney and a handful of others daring to speak the truth about Trump’s election lies are on the losing side. Trump has prevailed. Cheney may well be driven from the leadership in retribution but most likely with her conscience intact. www.washingtonpost.com/...  The @Liz_Cheney ouster is about more than loyalty to Trump. It shows the GOP effectively liberating itself to overturn future elections whose outcomes Republicans hate by any means necessary. Note that these same House Rs may be in control on Jan 6 2025:https://t.co/0MuOzRfDuO  “Responding to Republicans’ interest in replacing Cheney with a female conference chair Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office released a statement on Tuesday headlined: ‘GOP Leadership: Help Wanted — Non-Threatening Female.’” https://t.co/VrV1DAORrb  pic.twitter.com/7JNVGjOHwF https://t.co/GMRdnoTJQ7   How Elise Stefanik Adopted Trump’s Cult Of Personality To Become The Anti-Cheney https://t.co/p9LhPiFCwT via @TPM
