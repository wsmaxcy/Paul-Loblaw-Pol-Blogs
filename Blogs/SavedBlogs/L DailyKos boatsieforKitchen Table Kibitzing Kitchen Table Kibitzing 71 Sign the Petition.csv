L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 7/1: Sign the Petition, boatsieforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-07-01, Jeff Bezos has invested billions to spend three minutes in space later this month on his Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket along with his brother and an auction winner.   As he awaits liftoff a petition asking him not to come home has gathered more than 140000 signatures. “Billionaires should not exist...on earth or in space but should they decide the latter they should stay there” states the individual who started the petition “Do not allow Jeff Bezos to return to Earth.” By the way Bezos “space view” envisions a future in which individuals will have an option as to whether they want to live on Mars or remain on Earth which he believes will be habitable because  industries move to locations in outer space. He anticipates being able to fly to Mars by 2024. (Musk on the other hand projects humans on Mars by 2026.) The total space industry could grow by $1tn in the next decade according to Ron Epstein aerospace analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He sees a turning point as technology improvements and capital combine making space tourism and in-space manufacturing – of space stations or even pharmaceuticals – increasingly viable. Deep-pocketed investors were playing a role similar to that of predecessors who had helped aerospace grow into a global industry he said. www.theguardian.com/...  Meanwhile speaking of where you hang your hat up at night Bezos’ space cadet competitor Elon Musk has taken up residence in Boca Chica Texas near SpaceX’s development and test site in what the Houston Chronicle is saying is “ literally a box—a mass-produced 20 feet x 20 feet foldable prefabricated home made by Boxabl a startup making modular instant houses.”  This news of his modest abode comes as ...  Elon Musk's rocket company successfully sent dozens of satellites to space in one go with the Transporter-2 mission.   A Falcon 9 rocket carried 88 small satellites into space on Wednesday then made a rare and resounding landing on dry ground in Florida. SpaceX launched its Transporter-2 rideshare mission from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station around 12:30 p.m. PT (3:30 p.m. ET) and about eight minutes later the first-stage booster from the vehicle touched down not too far away at Cape Canaveral's Landing Zone One. Most SpaceX landings happen in the Atlantic Ocean aboard floating droneship platforms but about once or twice a year the booster will return to land ashore.    Why Are Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos So Interested in Space?  On top of satellite launches and other rocket innovations the company announced it will send its first “all civilian” crew into orbit at the end of the year in a mission called Inspiration4. SpaceX has already carried NASA astronauts to the International Space Station and is planning to transport more as well as private astronauts for a high price. Most ambitiously Mr. Musk has said that SpaceX will land humans on Mars by 2026. To do that the private company will use a chunk of the close to $3 billion — including $850 million announced this week in a regulatory filing — that it has raised over the last year to finance this herculean effort. While Mr. Musk might not be the first human to go to the red planet he once told me that he wanted to die there joking “Just not on landing.” www.nytimes.com/...  Perhaps the fact that life on Earth feels so precarious at this moment explains at least in part why Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk want to find ways to get off it. But it’s important to keep in mind that these two men are just two voices among billions of earthlings. It is incumbent on the rest of us to take more control of how we are going to move into the brave new worlds beyond our own gem of a planet  Keep in mind a hidden message that NASA engineers put onto the descent parachute of the Perseverance rover. The colors on the chute were a binary code that translates into “Dare mighty things.” Coming from across the vast and empty universe it was a message not meant just for Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk. It was actually meant for all of us. www.nytimes.com/...   Elon Musk Says We're All Going To Die So Let's Go To Mars (2016) We're talking a 400-foot-tall rocket which would make it the tallest in history if it existed today. Musk said it will fit roughly 100 people plus all the requisite cargo—luggage iron foundries pizza dough etc.—to build a functional society. The Best Places to Live in a Future Troubled by Climate Change  Rather than diving into a list let’s first build an understanding of traits to look for in an area to build or buy a home and enjoy peace of mind. Among the surprises on the list were Ireland (I’m in the process of applying for dual citizenship right now) Minneapolis and Denver. The Great Lakes States were included as was Greenland. If one were to pick the single biggest factor in choosing a place to live in 2050 and later it would be the distance from an ocean. Areas away from the coast but near lakes are ideal. Elevation can be helpful. As you can see it’s more about choosing good combinations of factors rather than looking for a location silver bullet.  Kitchen Table Kibitzing is a community series for those who wish to share a virtual kitchen table with other readers of Daily Kos who aren’t throwing pies at one another. Drop by to talk about music your weather your garden or what you cooked for supper…. Newcomers may notice that many who post in this series already know one another to some degree but we welcome guests at our kitchen table and hope to make some new friends as well.
