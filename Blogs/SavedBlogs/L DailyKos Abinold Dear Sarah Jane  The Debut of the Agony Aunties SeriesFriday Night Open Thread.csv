L, Dear Sarah Jane:  The Debut of the Agony Aunties SeriesFriday Night Open Thread, Abinold, 2021-04-23, In the press pool they call her S.J.  But to me she’s always Sarah Jane.   Dear Readers: Every letter I receive is reviewed carefully. However because I receive a very large number of letters I cannot answer everyone. Thank you for your understanding.  This is an open thread.  Jump on in!  But first a quick thought:  For this first episode I thought I’d first ask anyone who’d like to pose a question...er write a letter to Sarah Jane to go right ahead and do so  I’ll take note and forward all inquiries for future diaries.  I have no skills whatsoever with photoshop or anything fancy that would brighten up a column but between Sarah Jane and me we have one wit which we promise to put to good use.  To kick it all off here’s a classic honest-to-Pete Dear Abby! Dear Abby: My wife sleeps in the raw. Then she showers brushes her teeth and fixes our breakfast — still in the buff. We're newlyweds and there are just the two of us so I suppose there's really nothing wrong with it. What do you think? —EdDear Ed: It's O.K. with me. But tell her to put on an apron when she's frying bacon. This just in!  Our first letter!!!  (this is very exciting!)  Dear Sarah Jane     and one more cause I just love this guy.
