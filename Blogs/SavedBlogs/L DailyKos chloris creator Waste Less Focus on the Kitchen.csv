L, Waste Less: Focus on the Kitchen, chloris creator, 2021-06-27, As Seattle (!) and so many other parts of the planet face record high temperatures as droughts devastate the southwest and as hurricanes and heat waves become more powerful and prolonged we know we have to do more about the climate. Still as individuals it can be hard to make a difference to the climate. Even when you try you may discover that your recycling is not actually being recycled or the brands you are buying because they advertise their commitment to the environment but unfortunately they are lying. One thing we can each do is waste less food. Now much of food waste occurs outside of our kitchens. In third world countries the food spoils because of poor storage or because it doesn’t make it out of the fields. In first world countries a lot of the food is wasted because it’s too ugly for most grocery store shelves. Both problems are being attacked and there are some outfits that will deliberately sell you ugly vegetables. I am not recommending any because I have not used them (I am outside the US a lot) but if you use groups you trust please include in them in the comments. This article talks about the food waste in the US and how so much of it takes place in the home. Households are responsible for the largest portion of all food waste. ReFED estimates that US households waste 76 billion pounds of food per year. Major contributors to household food waste include: Only five percent of food is composted in the US and as a result uneaten food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste. In landfills food gradually breaks down to form methane a greenhouse gas that’s up to 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. According to a report from the UK based organization WRAP if food were removed from UK landfills the greenhouse gas abatement would be equivalent to removing one-fifth of all the cars in the UK from the road I have tried to come up with some ideas for wasting less food. The organization is random so please add your own! If you can actually lose a few pounds and reset your weight a little lower you’ll require less every day to maintain it. Put off shopping for a few days and eat down your fridge and your canned goods and your pasta and your rice and your beans. Time to dust off those packages and cans at the back of the pantry! Prevent food spoilage! This means having good containers for packing leftovers. Making sure you eat the food that won’t make it two more days. Keep certain foods away from each other. If you see a piece of fruit that has gone bad move it away from others immediately so the mold doesn’t spread. Now the fun part: use more parts of the fruits and veggies. Please add suggestions below! 🐦 I do a lot of other writing. A recent offering: Hunters of the Feather a story about a thinker-linker crow who wants to save birdkind from extinction. (It’s really good! It’s really cheap! Buy it! Review or rate it positively! Now available on Audible!) Now the second volume Scavengers of Mind is available. Other stories based on Jane Austen novels — including a new one for lovers of Pride & Prejudice Mrs. Bennet’s Advice to Young Ladies — and others on Greek mythology can be found here.
