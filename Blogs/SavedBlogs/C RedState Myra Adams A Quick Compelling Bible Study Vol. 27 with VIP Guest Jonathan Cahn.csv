C, A Quick Compelling Bible Study Vol. 27 with VIP Guest Jonathan Cahn, Myra Adams, 2020-09-20, Reposted from TOWNHALL – Sept 20 2020 Author’s Note: Interested readers who missed Vol. 2 – 26 of this series can click here  but Vol. 1 is here. Today is the second “series within a series” when I invite VIPs to share their favorite Bible passages with Townhall readers. The first was Vol. 9 with Harry Hargrave President of the Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. and continues now with Rabbi Jonathan Cahn. There is a specific reason why I asked Cahn to be my Bible Study “guest.” Next Saturday September 26 on the National Mall in Washington D.C. Rabbi Cahn is co-leading an event of critical importance – “The Return: National and Global Day of Prayer and Repentance.” Many readers are familiar with Cahn who leads Hope of the World Ministry and is a prophetic New York Times bestselling author of numerous books starting with “The Harbinger.” Cahn’s newest “The Harbinger II: The Return” (currently No. 8 on the NYT list) continues to warn about the inevitable consequences that beset a nation when it has turned away from God. For this study I asked Cahn to select verses that justify “The Return” event and he chose the following: 2 Chronicles 7:14 — If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.  Jonathan Cahn: This most crucial of promises was first given to Solomon as he prayed for his nation and specifically for mercy if it should turn against the ways of God. Its principles though are universal as America has turned away from and increasing wars against His ways. According to the biblical template that I explored in The Harbinger there is a time period given to that nation to turn back to God. Increasingly there are red flags and danger signs that this “window” is approaching an end. In fact one of the mysteries opened in The Harbinger II points to 2020 as a critical year a year of shakings – and why I had to write and release the book now. If we are nearing the end of this “window of grace” then it is all the more critical that we take this Scripture seriously. Many wonder if America has passed the point of no return. But before we accept that we must do everything we can to take God at His word and 2 Chronicles 7:14 is a promise from God. For this reason we have called for “The Return: National and Global Day of Prayer and Repentance.” It will begin the morning of Saturday September 26 on the National Mall between the Washington Monument and Capitol Hill. I pray that it will be a momentous and prophetic event. The organizers see it as a Sacred Assembly for God’s people to come together in the nation’s capital—in prayer and repentance—to intercede for our nation and for end-time revival. Without repentance there can be no revival. But with repentance the heavens can be opened. Interestingly the context of 2 Chronicles 7:14 is set in the previous verse “..or send a plague among my people.” Amazing. We now have a plague — and it is time to follow the instructions written in 7:14. Furthermore The Return will not only take place in Washington D.C. but all over America: in churches towns cities and homes by simulcast on television and live-streaming on the web. It’s open to everyone! Revelation 3:1-3 — I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive but you are dead. Wake up and strengthen what remains and is about to die for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. Remember then what you received and heard. Keep it and repent. If you will not wake up I will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour I will come against you. Cahn: These are sober warnings to the church that we can apply to our own day. The Lord called us (believers) to be a light to the world. Had we been the light to America this nation could never have become as dark as it is today. Much of the church has grown lukewarm and cold to God. The church is more interested in God as a personal trainer to be invoked for our personal prosperity and success—rather than the Almighty Sovereign to which we must surrender and bow down. Revival begins with repentance and repentance must begin with the church. Thus we will begin The Return with repentance for the church to return to our First Love. Joel 2:12-13 — “Even now” declares the Lord “return to me with all your heart with fasting and weeping and mourning.” Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God for he is gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love and he relents from sending calamity. Cahn: ‘Even now..’ meaning after all this God still longs to have mercy. And in the case of America that means much. Even now after we’ve driven Him out of the public square and out of our culture. Even now after we’ve called evil good and good evil. Even now He still longs to have mercy. This verse sets the template for the Sacred or Solemn Assembly. It is this very Scripture that The Return will follow. Malachi 3:7 —“Return to me and I will return to you.” Cahn: This critical Scripture promise can be applied to our day. God’s heart is to return to us but we must also return to Him. In Hebrew the word for ‘return’ and ‘repent’ are the same. There is a mystery to The Return that we recently realized: On the Biblical calendar September 26 is a sacred day called ‘Shabbat Shuvah.’ The word ‘Shabbat’ means ‘Sabbath’ and ‘Shuvah’ means ‘Return’! Thus the day of “The Return” will occur on the day ordained on the Biblical calendar as the Day of the Return! Therefore I do not doubt that God Himself has appointed and called for the Return—and the future of America may hang on it.
