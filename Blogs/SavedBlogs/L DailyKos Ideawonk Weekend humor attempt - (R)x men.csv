L, Weekend humor attempt - (R)x men, Ideawonk, 2021-05-01, [NEWS FLASH].  Part of the Mueller project “brotherhood” sub-report has been unredacted.  It is a bombshell of revelations about some in our elected government.  There are (R)x men living among us.  Yes that’s right (R)x men!!  They claim they just want peaceful co-existence but we know better.  Mueller unmasked them one by one.  Their names were redacted until now. Projectorio — he has the superpower of seeing all of the evils in the world simply by looking into any ordinary mirror.    Laffer — is an econo-nesiac — with the power to make people believe that only he can make the stock market rise    Fiduci-Fairy  — sibling to Laissez (see below) he has the power to create massive political tipping points for donors disguised as “capitalism” Liber-Terry — has mathematical superpowers allowing everything to go in all directions unabated but with the right incantation the math shows an ascending arrow. Polly Alloy.  She can shapeshift and recovers from damage by rebranding; e.g. R to T1 to T2 and for 2024 baby T’s. Chrono — this (R)x-man’s superpower is that no matter the time of day or year he can make it seem to be 1950 1865 or 1776. Obfuscatatorio — has the power to spit thousands of words from his mouth in rapid-fire causing all those within earshot to lose their ability to think Assimilato — has the superpower to absorb others into a monoculture using the Lorelei lure of f-r-e-e-d-o-m.  Assimilato has the nickname Bjorn. Pacchidermi — he doesn't have an actual superpower but a superweapon.  It is an accountability cloak disguised as an elephant hide.  Just slip it over your head and the media magically spew othersiderisms. Middlemanic — has the power to extract money from people in exchange for doing nothing Laissez-fairy — she has the superpower of doing nothing in exchange for credit for doing something Laissez Fairy is a sibling to Fiduci and cousin to Middlemanic. Quafficus — has the superpower to hairspray his hair “bigly”.  This mesmerizes the weaker-minded. Q — doesn't really exist.  It was a made-up name to hide the (R)x men. gull-Able — he has the superpower to write in comment sections that authors should have used snark tags because they weren't obvious. Now picture what the movie looks like.
