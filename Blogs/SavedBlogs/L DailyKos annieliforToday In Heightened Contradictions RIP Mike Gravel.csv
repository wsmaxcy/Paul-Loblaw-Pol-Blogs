L, RIP Mike Gravel, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-06-27, Former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel has passed away at the age of 91. This past year his campaign for president reminded some of previous “Children’s Crusades”. Gravel garnered attention for his fiery comments at Democratic forums. In one 2007 debate the issue of the possibility of using nuclear weapons against Iran came up and Gravel confronted then-Sen. Obama. “Tell me Barack who do you want to nuke?” Gravel said. Obama replied: “I’m not planning to nuke anybody right now Mike.” [...] Gravel briefly ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. He again criticized American wars and vowed to slash military spending. His last campaign was notable in that both his campaign manager and chief of staff were just 18 at the time of his short-lived candidacy. “There was never any ... plan that he would do anything more than participate in the debates. He didn’t plan to campaign but he wanted to get his ideas before a larger audience” Johnson said. Gravel failed to qualify for the debates. He endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the contest eventually won by now-President Joe Biden apnews.com/… “My strong stance against war the military industrial complex and American imperialism seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites who are out of touch with the average Americans” - Mike Gravel #mikegravel @GravelInstitute #sundayvibes #antiwar https://t.co/Ql4lygvNDW  .   *pointing out a shooting star to my young son* see that?
