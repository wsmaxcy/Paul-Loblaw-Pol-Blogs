L, Oh Dear Mike Pence Is Running For President, Tengrain, 03-30-21, As the Associated Press finds an excuse to horserace 2024 already.  The last time we heard from walking termite buffet former VP Mike Pence he was ululating at the moon er narrating the Junkie Limbaugh documentary. Imagine our shock to learn that Mr. Somnambulant has ambitions to sniff inherit the throne! WASHINGTON (AP) — When former President Donald Trump was asked to list those he considers the future leaders of the Republican Party he quickly rattled off a list of names including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. Conspicuously absent from the list: Mike Pence. The former vice president is steadily reentering public life as he eyes a potential run for the White House in 2024. He’s joining conservative organizations writing op-eds delivering speeches and launching an advocacy group that will focus on promoting the Trump administration’s accomplishments. This ought to be interesting. It’s not just that Pence is one of the dullest and most boring theocrats alive it’s that the GQP base actually tried to capture-and-kill him for uh reasons (disloyalty to Prznint Stupid refusing to overthrow democracy for Hair Füror etc.) and that Possum Hollar is a wholly-owned property of a certain NYC developer who plans to rehab it for one of his trash palaces. What road does Pence see to victory? The GQP probably still has a bounty on his head (near the fly?) and someone looking for his place in Q-history to be told in song and story will try to 2nd Amendment him.

Secret Service decided to disguise him as a clitoris so Republicans will never be able to find him. — TheDaily (@StopTheCriminal) March 29 2021 Mike Pence is planning to run for president in 2024. He’ll get one percent of the primary vote drop out and blame lesbians for his failure. — Palmer Report (@PalmerReport) March 30 2021 How is he going to run if he has to hide for his life  from the voters he needs? — Grudgie the Whale (@grudging1) March 30 2021 Editor's Note (Frances Langum):  We shouldn't have to say this but yeah:  C&L doesn't wish assassination on anyone and certainly attempting to martyr Mike Pence is a very bad very stupid idea.
