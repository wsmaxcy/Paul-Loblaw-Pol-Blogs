L, Tiffany Cross: Tim Scott embarrassingly on the wrong side of history. 2 sides to every token. OUCH!, Egberto Willies, 2021-05-02, Senator Tim Scott was willing to allow the Republican Party to make him a sacrificial lamb. Tiffany Cross called out Scott like no other. See full episodes here. Tiffany Cross was justifiably not kind to Tim Scott. Nor should she have been. This will be my last commentary on Scott's disingenuous response to President Joe Biden's Presidential Address response. The White House Chief of Staff has already given a cogent response for Scott's entire diatribe that I feel a responsibility to repeat to ensure non of his misinformation is cauterized in the minds of anyone. "I have always said I think the Trump administration deserves some credit for its work on vaccine development" Ron Klain said. "But in terms of where the tide was when Joe Biden became president the week before he became president this country had a million people file for unemployment. The week he became president 900000. We were losing people at the rate of 3000 to 4000 a day for COVID. Two weeks before Joe Biden became President; more people died from COVID than during the Vietnam War. So that is where the tide was when Joe Biden became president. We weren't vaccinating people. Fewer than one percent of seniors were fully vaccinated when Joe Biden swore the oath of office. Today that number is 70% in just a hundred days. Yes the vaccines were developed basically on science that came along before Donald Trump became president. But sure I am happy to give the Trump administration credit for moving that along. But the key thing isn't vaccines but vaccinations. It's getting those shots in people's arms. It's getting the economy turned around. That's what started when Joe Biden became president." Cross started by castigating the Senator. "This week the sole black Republican and ascendant sounded a stone fool when he said this" Tiffany Cross said as she played Tim Scott forcingly claiming that America is not a racist country. "Let's be clear. Tim Scott does not represent any constituency other than the small number of sleepy slow-witted sufferers of Stockholm Syndrome who get elevated to prominence for repeating a false narrative about this country that makes conservative white people feel comfortable because when you speak an uncomfortable truth like Nicole Hannah Jones the party that Scott claims is not racist gets big mad and tries to silence you." She then points out his utter hypocrisy. "Tim Scott has spoken out about his encounters with law enforcement and he co-sponsored the anti-lynching bill in the senate but there are two sides to every token so thirsty for white approval this dude actually stood on the national stage to defend the voter suppression law in Georgia even though as of last month 361 bills were being introduced in 47 states to keep people who look like him out of the ballot box The ability to shame the ancestors and appease the oppressors all in one speech that's extreme though not quite like the domestic violent extremism that the department of homeland security is investigating within its own ranks. Mind you but please Senator say more about how un-racist the country is while you trot out that tired line about going from cotton to Congress to clown." Tiffany Cross ends with an important statement that points out that unless we understand our faults our past we cannot make a better future. "Is America a racist country is one that has been asked and answered many times over" Cross continued. Yet we still love America not for what it was but for what it could be. On this one you're not only on the wrong side of the aisle Senator Scott but you're embarrassingly on the wrong side of history as well." Tiffany said all that needed to be said to and about Tim Scott. It is now time to move on. The narrative is not about whether America is racist. It is what are we going to do as we disregard a discredited Tim Scott to make life better for all will real Progressive policies.
