L, Would anyone be interested about being in on a HelperBot build?, FuzzyTheBotbuilder, 2021-04-25, Hey all! I’m rebuilding a robot that had a catastrophic failure. He kinda fell off his loading ramp and smashed beyond repair. It’s the one in the picture actually. His past life was as a yardbot. He could spread seed fertilizer weedkiller and push snow. He’s going to be totally repurposed. He’s going to be my helper robot so I can get back to my trail-walking hiking and festival-going.Here’s what I’m thinking. My 13 year old grandson wants to learn robotics. He lives with me full time now.  I have to have something to keep us busy this summer. I’m a retired field engineer/tech/welder. Kinda obvious to me at least.  This will be a weekly/biweekly post during the summer as we work on this build. I’m wanting suggestions and ideas on some of the features I need to include. I’ll be going into detail on how I build it but I’ll also be covering the thinking and the development process behind it. Probably funny stories or WTF items that come up too. There will probably be practical ideas as far as covering issues with ADA problems and just stuff about being differently abled in general. What do you think? Anybody else up for coming along for the ride? Okay I realized I didn’t make my thoughts entirely clear. I’m still a bit tired from getting him settled in for the last week. I’m going to include polls for suggestions plus reading the comments closely for any ideas that I can figure out how to add and pull off. I want input because I know people out there have good ideas that may spark a good addition. And thanks for the input so far!!
