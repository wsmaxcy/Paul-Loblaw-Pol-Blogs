L, I Was So Naive a Poem of the Past and of Today, Paul Frea, 2021-04-18, What follows is what I would call a memory poem. It is about a memory from a long time ago. But it is something I have been thinking a lot about this last year and especially the last few weeks. I believe it is relevant to one stream of current events today.   When I was seventeen I had a summer job With a maintenance crew Which cared for the landscaping  Around townhouses a small shopping mall An industrial park With some undeveloped areas in between There was mowing planting and weeding Digging and a smattering of odd jobs Sometimes I worked alone but often I was paired with someone else And that is how I met Tom from Texas Which made me  Carl from Colorado  Most of the guys were okay   To work with It was really fun when I was working With my best friend Dan Who I had known since seventh grade But after a couple of weeks Dan was assigned to a riding mower So I didn't see him much Tom and I though clicked right away –  Whatever our assigned task for the day was We each just took to naturally complementing The other's work  We became work friends Talking and laughing as we worked But still going along fast enough  To keep the boss happy We had a synergy That made the work day go faster  What we talked about during those three months I don't remember except for one thing Which I am coming to  I should let you know that Tom was black And I am white But during that time I really had no idea that skin color Was supposed to make a difference  The school system I was in  Was basically white But there were a handful of black students Which I had some interaction with In shared classes and in school clubs There was Debbie A. – Who was hot And Mickey R. who was a year below me But I remember him as being funny  There were never any issues that I was aware of But perhaps I was in a self-absorbed teen age bubble This was a time before cell phones and computers And social media – Just having a color television set Was a big deal I was oblivious To the racial struggle out in the world To me then A guy was guy A girl was a girl...  Anyway Tom and I spent a lot of time together From 8 to 4:30 many days out of each week's five I was enjoying our friendship So it kind of hurt when one Friday Maybe three weeks before the summer job ended Tom told me it was his last day  That afternoon we worked together In a remoter part of the maintenance territory Doing something with some fencing We talked more seriously but he didn't say Why he was quitting  Just that he had to go back to Texas And then he said something I didn't understand And let slide at the time: “I didn't know they could be like you.”  About that time the maintenance truck Came to pick us up and return us to the office We punched out then shook hands We said goodbye I got on my bicycle peddled towards home And never saw Tom again  That one strange sentence bounced around In my brain for awhile Then school started and I forget all about it  Now fifty years later those words have come back to me Jogged by the horrible events now being recorded For all to see From Ferguson to Floyd And all the black deaths Between and after And I think I know now what Tom meant with “...they could be like you.”  At seventeen racism and white supremacy Had surrounded and pushed and pounded And coated Tom's life with an invisible notion That separated him from the common shared humanity That is the real reality  The white lie Which is all based upon an ancient robbery Of enslavement Of what cannot by truly owned The human heart The human mind The human body  Perhaps in that summer Tom found an oasis Where not every white person Was some type of danger Perhaps he got to escape for a time From the way his world was With its threats and constrictions  I hope that it was so when we were together And perhaps too with everyone else On our crew  I am so sad So angry So disappointed That in the long course  Of my lifetime It did not get better For Tom Eric Michael Tamir Walter Stephon Breonna George Daunte  And all the lost And all the injured And all their kin -  Who are our kin as well.                                          Carl Scott Harker ©2021 _________________________________________________________ My latest book of poetry —  poems written between late April to Late October 2020 is now available and you can find it on Amazon here:  Above Us Only Sky.
