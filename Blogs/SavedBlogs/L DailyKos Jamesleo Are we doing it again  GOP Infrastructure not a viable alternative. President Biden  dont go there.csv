L, Are we doing it again?  GOP Infrastructure not a viable alternative. President Biden  don't go there, Jamesleo, 2021-04-22, thehill.com/…   Are we trying this dance again The Republicans do not bargain in good faith They will put a bill that accomplishes nothing; vote against it and them run against it in the midterms How many times do have to burn our hands on a hot stove before we realize “we get burned FROM THE ARTICLE: Republicans have largely balked at Biden's American Jobs Plan proposal which outlines $2.3 trillion worth of spending to invest in roads bridges railways electric vehicles broadband long-term care workers weatherizing buildings and climate friendly industries. Biden proposed paying for the plan through an increase in the corporate tax rate though he has said he'd be willing to discuss ways to fund the proposal. The proposal unveiled Thursday by a group of Senate Republicans led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) narrowed down the definition of infrastructure and focused on funding for roads and bridges public transit systems rail wastewater infrastructure airports and broadband infrastructure.  Senate Republicans are proposing user fees for electric vehicles and repurposing unused federal spending allocated by the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Congress passed in March to cover the cost of the plan. This alone is unaccountable We need a bold bill that accomplishes something that will improve the lives of most Americans and Yes: give the voters to vote for something in 2021  I hope  Biden  does not fall for this
