L, Federal Judge Argues Media Is A 'Threat To Democracy' And Anti-GOP, Ed Scarce, 2021-03-20, Of particular note the 85-year-old Reagan appointee's comments were directed at companies not even involved in the case at hand. Apparently he just felt like spewing some right-wing nonsense in a dissent one person calling it a "gratuitous tangent." Source: Bloomberg News A conservative judge on the influential federal appeals court in Washington used his dissent in a defamation case to lambaste most U.S. media outlets for trumpeting ‚Äúshocking‚Äù anti-Republican views and call for libel laws to be revised to make it easier to sue the press. The New York Times and The Washington Post are ‚Äúvirtually Democratic Party broadsheets‚Äù while the news section of the Wall Street Journal ‚Äúleans in the same direction‚Äù U.S. Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman said. He said the major television outlets and Silicon Valley giants were similarly biased. ‚ÄúOne-party control of the press and media is a threat to a viable democracy‚Äù Silberman wrote. He exempted from his criticism of ‚ÄúDemocratic ideological control‚Äù Fox News The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs editorial page. But he lamented that these outlets are ‚Äúcontrolled by a single man and his son‚Äù a reference to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and questioned how long they could hold out. ‚ÄúAfter all there are serious efforts to muzzle Fox News‚Äù the Reagan appointee wrote without elaborating. üö®D.C. Circuit Judge Silberman just released a truly wild dissent calling on the Supreme Court to overturn New York Times v. Sullivan claiming NYT and WaPo are "virtually Democratic Party broadsheets" and accusing "big tech" of censoring conservatives. https://t.co/NvFli5sEso pic.twitter.com/mTMklTlNfo ‚Äî Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) March 19 2021 In an already gratuitous tangent calling for overturning a key 1st Amendment precedent that protects the free press 85-year-old Laurence Silberman seems to have lost the filter that counsels most judges against displaying a nakedly partisan demeanor. https://t.co/36iPZCv9qD pic.twitter.com/ukUxyH3jUz ‚Äî Charlie Savage (@charlie_savage) March 19 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
