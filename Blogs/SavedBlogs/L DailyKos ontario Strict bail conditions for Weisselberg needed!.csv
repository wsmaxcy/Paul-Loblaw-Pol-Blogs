L, Strict bail conditions for Weisselberg needed!, ontario, 2021-07-01, The courts should ensure this man cannot return to work for or communicate with Trump or famiky/ employees in any form. He must be the only one who knows in which shells to hide any new receipts or from which and how to retrieve money secretly for Trump or the families to avoid revealing the shells. I cannot imagine he has shown anyone else how to do all those transactions or there will be one very implicated accomplice. If T ever knew I cannot imagine he or kids could pull it off now under certain law-enforcement scrutiny. Another factor to consider in the unravelling. Thoughts?
