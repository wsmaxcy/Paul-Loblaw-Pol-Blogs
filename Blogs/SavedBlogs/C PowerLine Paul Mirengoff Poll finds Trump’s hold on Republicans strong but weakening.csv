C, Poll finds Trump’s hold on Republicans strong but weakening, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-04-28, A new  NBC poll finds (at page 19) that 50 percent of Republicans say they consider themselves mainly supporters of the GOP while 44 percent say them consider themselves mainly supporters of Donald Trump. That’s an extraordinarily high number for Trump to be sure.  However as  Rich Lowry notes it represents a decline. In January respondents split evenly 46-46. In October it was 54 for Trump and only 38 for the GOP.  I hope the trend continues. After all whatever might be the case in 2024 Trump will not be on the ballot in 2022. The Republican party will be. If the GOP is to regain control of the Senate and the House it will be helpful and perhaps imperative that Republicans identify with their party strongly and to a greater extent than they identify with an individual who has an agenda of his own. In January we saw in Georgia what can happen when a great many Republicans don’t feel that way.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
