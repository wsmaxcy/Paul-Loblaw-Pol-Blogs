L, Lauren Boebert Tweeted About A ‘Disaster Presidency' And Got A Stark Reality Check, Lee Moran, 2021-06-26, Conspiracy theory-endorsing Rep. Lauren Boebert’s (R-Colo.) latest dig at Joe Biden on Twitter backfired in much the same way as many of her previous attacks on the president. On Friday Boebert claimed she was “yet to see a liberal be able to praise Joe Biden on his own merits” some six months into his “disaster presidency.” “It’s always ‘But Trump’ or ‘But the GOP’” the Colorado Republican declared. Six months into this disaster presidency and I’ve yet to see a liberal be able to praise Joe Biden on his own merits.It’s always “But Trump” or “But the GOP”. “Is this a bit?” one Twitter user responded. Other critics reminded Boebert of the disasters of Donald Trump’s presidency including Trump’s catastrophic handling of the coronavirus pandemic: I am liberal. This is me praising Joe Biden on his own merits. Next. Is this a bit? https://t.co/TVXT0YDjr1 I'm a Republican and I am praising Biden for his performance to-date.. You on the other hand have proven your incompetence day in and and day out. https://t.co/PQFEsRnnOq Biden is fully 50% more popular than Trump was at his best ever on his merits. Getting tens of millions vaccinated rebuilding trust with allies ceasing the heinous subservience to dictators & thugs... people of all political backgrounds see we are better off. The hypocrisy is strong with this one 1. Biden passed COVID relief2. Biden has reached a bipartisan deal for an infrastructure bill3. Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday 4. Biden visited Tulsa and paid respects for the Race Massacre Oh let me be among the first! President Biden has compassion experience and vision! President Biden has extraordinary skill in choosing talented ethical and visionary people to serve in his administration! Guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one. https://t.co/E4e2swYWp7 Finally it’s infrastructure week y’all!! Thanks President Biden!!https://t.co/f8idXNDXED "Cheap shot" boebert has done nothing to heal this nation. https://t.co/Gkhjgbh9wU What's the disaster? If you can't see and realize the turnaround you're...oh why do I bother. Instead of working for all people to have better lives you work against prosperity and progress. You tweet bullshit all day and troll. Do something constructive. https://t.co/4hnq5uNzuG 200 million vaccines in 100 days. Zero cabinet members under federal indictment.
