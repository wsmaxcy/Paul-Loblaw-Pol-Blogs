L, Share and Enjoy:  "What Do You Do Next?" -- The Start of Fantasy Role-Playing Games, quarkstomper, 2021-04-29, Share and Enjoy Dept:  One of my associates in the Furry Community cartoonist Ken Fletcher wrote this essay about the early days of Fantasy Role-Playing Games.  Ken is a furry artist from Minneapolis and has been an SF fan & amateur zine artist since about 1966.  He has also worked for a couple small game companies associated with Dave Arneson who along with Gary Gygax is credited with developing Dungeons & Dragons.  With his permission I am posting his essay.  Consider this essay an advance notice that there will be a lot of reporting and media attention to Fantasy Role-playing games between now and maybe 2027.  Media coverage will be appear for many ‘50-year anniversary’ events including for the “Greyhawk” castle setting in 2022 The publication of the “Dungeons & Dragons” rule-books in 2024 and “Advanced Dungeons & Dragons” in 2027 not to mention the start a host of other RPGs. Time for the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the most important new method of storytelling since the short-story.   - — — — — —   Addenda: For Minneapolis sf fans a "grandfalloon": The official D&D rules were first published in 1974. That year (just before the distributions of the 1000 (?) copies sold to gamers game-shops & at conventions) Dave Arneson & players in the Blackmoor game brought 'authors-copies' of the rules (Dave Arneson was given co-creator credit on the rules) to a meeting of the University of Minnesota Gaming Club. This was a test-run to see how typical board-game wargamers would react to the idea of fantasy role-playing. A game of Blackmoor was started with the new players participating. It was a big hit.  One of the gamers there was 'BluePetal' a member of a local science fiction club "Minn-Stf" (nowdays MN-Stf). He was enthusiastic. He went home that night and started recreating a variant that used mostly pencil grid-paper a map for the dungeon-master and the dungeon-master's imagination. He tried out this basic 'fantasy role-playing' on his apartment-mates. They liked it. The next Minn-Stf meeting he introduced it to the science fiction fans. Many of them liked it. By 2 weeks the sf club had about 6 new dungeon variants and dungeon-masters. Over the next year or so this wild batch of variants was called "Minnesota Dungeon". Some of the fantasy role-playing game historians attribute some of the early spread of D&D popularity to the sf fans spreading the news of these variant 'Dungeon' games through the network of sf fanzines and games played at the science fiction conventions.
