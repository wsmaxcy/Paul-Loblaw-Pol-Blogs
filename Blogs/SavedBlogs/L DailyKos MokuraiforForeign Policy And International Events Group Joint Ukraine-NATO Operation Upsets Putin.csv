(Rachel is well known to have Too Much FunTM with the news on occasion.) Ukraine says joint NATO military exercises to begin soon Axios April 3 2021 Russia which supports separatist forces battling Ukraine's military in the Donbass region said Friday it strongly opposes the drills and will "have to take additional measures" if NATO deploys troops to eastern Ukraine.

Moscow said one of its warships fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of British destroyer Defender on Wednesday to force her out of an area near the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014. Britain denied that account insisted its ship wasn’t fired upon and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters. Russia denounced the Defender’s move as a provocation and warned that next time it could fire to hit intruding warships if they again try to test Russian military resolve.
