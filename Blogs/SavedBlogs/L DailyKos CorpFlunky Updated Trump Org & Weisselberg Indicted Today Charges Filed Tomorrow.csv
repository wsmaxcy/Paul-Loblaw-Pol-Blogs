L, Updated: Trump Org & Weisselberg Indicted Today Charges Filed Tomorrow, CorpFlunky, 2021-06-30, First charges will be “related to allegedly evading taxes on fringe benefits” including perks such as cars apartments and tuition that Weisselberg received from Trump Org that the org Weisselberg (and other employees) may not have paid taxes due.   ”Defendants are expected to appear in court on Thursday afternoon” according to people “familiar with the matter”.  Weisselberg has rejected cooperating with the three year NY AG & DA joint investigation so far.   More behind paywall.  CNN says the investigators are also looking at “cash bonuses”.  CNBC cites one source who says “2 pm Thursday”.    59% of readers here predicted that the initial charges would include fraud or money laundering.  33% said the first charges would be “obscure” “paperwork”  or specifically “tax evasion since fraud is difficult to prove”.  7% predicted no charges.   MSNBC cites Trump’s legal defense team members as source for timing and they remind us that being under indictment may trigger banks to activate their rights to call loans early.  Jen Weisselberg (ex daughter-in-law) deserves credit for going public on the compensation-related crimes and for cooperating with prosecutors.  CNBC reports that Trump Org & Weisselberg were indicted by the grand jury today that Weisselberg will surrender in the morning that the charges will be unsealed tomorrow and that Weisselberg will be arraigned tomorrow.
