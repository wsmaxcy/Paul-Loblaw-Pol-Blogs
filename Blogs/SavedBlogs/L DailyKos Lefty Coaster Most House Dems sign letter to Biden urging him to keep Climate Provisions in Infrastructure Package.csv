L, Most House Dems sign letter to Biden urging him to keep Climate Provisions in Infrastructure Package, Lefty Coaster, 2021-07-01,  A majority of House Democrats signed a letter to President Biden urging him to restore the climate related provisions to the proposed Infrastructure Package. This is a resounding vindication of the Sunrise Movement’s protest at the White House yesterday. See: Sunrise Movement use chains to block WH gates as Biden guts Green Infrastructure to satisfy GOP  Dear President Biden Thank you for your strong leadership as we work together to help the American people recover from the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Rescue Plan provided long overdue aid to our constituents. Now we must live up to our promise to put millions back to work while rebuilding our infrastructure expanding access to health care and improving our nation’s environmental resiliency. In particular our constituents would benefit economically from the ambitious and much-needed climate action envisioned under the American Jobs Plan. The proposal outlines a popular agenda that involves transforming our energy transportation and water systems; increasing our nation’s climate resilience; retrofitting schools and buildings with clean energy and efficient technologies; providing clean water to all; and restoring and increasing access to nature. Notonly will these components of the plan create jobs in our communities but they will also at long last catapult our nation’s infrastructure into the 21st century. With this in mind we want to strongly underscore our support for the following components of the American Jobs Plan as you work towards a final agreement on the package this summer:  Driving the United States towards a 100 percent carbon-free energy powered electricity grid and new cars buses and buildings by 2035. The robust ten-year tax title outlined in the Made in America Tax Plan is a critical part of this effort. Complementary policies such as a clean energy and energy efficiency standard major electric vehicle purchasing charging infrastructure manufacturing incentives and bolstering clean energy research and development are also crucial to this goal.  Delivering on the basic right of clean water. Too many communities especially low income and communities of color suffer from failing water infrastructure polluted water supplies and unaffordable water rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and worsened this crisis. We must improve our country’s water infrastructure and take the necessary steps to remove lead pipes and service lines so we can deliver clean water forall.  Supporting the maintenance and creation of millions of high-quality well-paying union jobs in the domestic clean energy and manufacturing sectors and across the economy. These are the energy jobs of the future but there is no guarantee they will go to American. workers as other countries build out their clean energy capabilities. We must ensure clean energy jobs are created here in the United States not overseas to the benefit of our global competitors.  Justice and equity for low-income and communities of color harmed by the legacy of toxic pollution. For too long these communities have suffered disproportionate impacts of pollution and they continue to be hit first and worst by the impacts of climate change. This legislation should deliver on the Justice40 Initiative’s commitment that 40 percent of program benefits are reserved for these most impacted communities.  Making lands and waters part of the climate solution. We should invest in natural infrastructure restoration and reclamation of damaged lands to increase carbon sequestration increase resilience and reduce pollution. We must also prioritize access to nature for communities – especially communities of color and low-income communities who face barriers to access open spaces and lack community-based green space. We are eager to help advance through Congress a strong American Jobs Plan that employs our communities and matches the scale of the challenge climate science tells us we face. Ultimately we urge you and our colleagues to act with the goal of ensuring the final legislative package gets across the finish line in the coming months while maintaining our key jobs and climate goals. Thank you for your commitment to the prosperity of the American people and positioning our country to continue to lead the world.  BY ZACK BUDRYK The letter comes as the progressive wing of the Democratic party has increasingly sought to pressure the White House to preserve climate action in the American Jobs Plan. Activists with the advocacy group Sunrise Movement protested outside the White House Monday with Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) addressing the demonstration. The White House has denied climate provisions are on the chopping block after the announcement of a bipartisan infrastructure deal. Appearing at a White House press briefing Wednesday Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan depended the bipartisan agreement as “historic.”  During the covert recordings which have been passed to Channel 4 News Mr McCoy claims: Watching House Democrats come together on this crucial issue is gratifying to see.
