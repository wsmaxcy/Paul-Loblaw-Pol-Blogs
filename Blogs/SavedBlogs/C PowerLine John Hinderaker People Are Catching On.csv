C, People Are Catching On, John Hinderaker, 2021-07-06, Watching the Democratic Party press try to pretend that Joe Biden is a fully-functioning adult has been entertaining. To the extent that anyone sees Biden in action that effort is futile. Thus despite the press’s determination to pretend that all is well people are figuring out that Biden is not all there. Trafalgar asked the question: “Do you believe President Biden is fully executing the duties of his office?” Possible answers were “Yes he is directing all policy and agenda” “No others are directing policy and agenda” and “Not sure.” The results show that the emperor’s nakedness is visible to most:  Independents usually those who pay the least attention are not being fooled:  These numbers will only get worse as more people observe Biden and as his deterioration continues. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
