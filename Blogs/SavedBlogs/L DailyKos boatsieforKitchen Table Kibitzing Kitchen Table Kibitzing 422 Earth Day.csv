L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 4/22: Earth Day, boatsieforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-04-22,   And in a year in which a deadly pandemic has had the globe in its grip and climate change helped spark a cascade of calamities from raging wildfires to a ferocious hurricane season the focus of this year's Earth Day couldn't be more timely. “At the heart of Earth Day’s 2021 theme Restore Our Earth is optimism a critically needed sentiment in a world ravaged by both climate change and the pandemic" said Kathleen Rogers president of EarthDay.org. news.mit.edu/...  Twenty million people were out in the streets across the country on the first Earth Day April 22 1970. This remains the largest civil turnout in history. Because of Covid-19  most events this year were held virtually. Climate change topped the roster of themes in the “Restore Our Earth” campaign which focuses on innovation ecosystem restoration and green technologies. And discussions came to light about the connections between Covid-19 and the environment. Last year as Covid lockdowns led to a significant reduction of polluting GHGs people in Punjab India took to Instagram and Twitter to post pictures of the Himalayas visible to them for the first time in 30 years. For many it was the first time they had ever seen the mountains. Fish were visible in the unpolluted canals in Venice. Air pollution seen from satellites far above China disappeared. An MIT Study revealed that many nations experienced a reduction in GHGs during 2020 a reduction which also precipitated international “economic shocks.”  Although the economic impacts are not expected to have any long term impact on “long term emissions they may well have a significant indirect effect on the level of investment that nations are willing to commit to meet or beat their Paris emissions targets” says MIT Joint Program Co-Director Emeritus John Reilly the study’s lead author. “Our projections of global economic activity with and without the pandemic show only a small impact of Covid-19 on emissions in 2030 and beyond” says Reilly.  (How will Covid-19 ultimately impact climate change?) 2020 marked the year with the steepest decline in energy use since the second World War according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)  who predicts a sharp uptake in CO2 emissions post Covid. In fact the increase in CO2 emissions is anticipated to be the second largest ever although it will be slightly lower than 2019. In a YaleEnvironmet 360 article Global CO2 Emissions Set to Surge in 2021 in Post-Covid Economic Rebound the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects CO2 emissions to  increase by 1.5 billion tons this year.   But there is promising news. Covid has created a boilerplate one which relies on “using science real-time data and a global community working towards a common goal of improved personal health.”  Recent research on changes in environmental health during the Covid-19 lock down presented at the Goddard Space Flight Center found “that the environment is quickly changing and the timing of those changes seems to indicate that the pandemic may be a reason. Deforestation rates are changing in some places air pollution is diminishing water quality is improving and snow is becoming more reflective in some areas since the pandemic began earlier this year.” (Bates 2020 para. 1) The pandemic is giving us new data and a new opportunity to use our current experiences to begin new approaches and behaviors that will help improve our world’s environmental health.  www.wpi.edu/...  Some of this year’s Earth Day events continue through the weekend.   April 22-23: Biden’s global climate change summit Biden is expected to unveil a new emissions reduction target for the Paris climate accord before or during the summit and pledge money to help less wealthy countries combat climate change.  Earth Day Live Three days of climate action through Friday Earth Day NASA (through Saturday) To celebrate Earth Day 2021 (Thursday April 22) NASA is hosting a virtual Earth Day event – from Wednesday April 21 through Saturday April 24 – focused on how to live more sustainably on our home planet and exploring the connections between Earth’s atmosphere water cycle forests fields cities ice caps and climate. The program – called #ConnectedByEarth – will feature live presentations by NASA scientists conversations with astronauts and scientists working in space videos interactive science content a kid-friendly fun zone a scavenger hunt hundreds of downloadable resources and more. Some content will also be available in Spanish. Registration is free and open to the public. Register to participate here.  THIS IS AN OPEN THREAD. How is everyone tonight?  Kitchen Table Kibitzing is a community series for those who wish to share a virtual kitchen table with other readers of Daily Kos who aren’t throwing pies at one another. Drop by to talk about music your weather your garden or what you cooked for supper…. Newcomers may notice that many who post in this series already know one another to some degree but we welcome guests at our kitchen table and hope to make some new friends as well.
