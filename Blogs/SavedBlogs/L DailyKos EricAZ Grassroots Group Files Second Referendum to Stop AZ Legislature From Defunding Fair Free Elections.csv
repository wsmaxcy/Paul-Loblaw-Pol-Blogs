L, Grassroots Group Files Second Referendum to Stop AZ Legislature From Defunding Fair Free Elections, EricAZ, 2021-07-02, Phoenix AZ – Today Arizona Deserves Better a grassroots organization dedicated to defending democracy and voting rights for Arizonans filed for another referendum petition intended to stop the Legislature from defunding fair and free elections. HB 2569 prevents elections officials from receiving private grants to help them run elections or register voters even if the legislature provides inadequate funding for elections and voter registration. Election officials have used grant funds to purchase equipment used to provide timely and accurate election results. If enough people sign this petition voters will decide whether election officials should be allowed to accept private grants. “As a group of concerned citizens that feel democracy is under attack and that very little is being done to protect our voting rights Arizona Deserves Better feels obligated to act in the best interest of all Arizonans” said Eric Kramer Arizona Deserves Better board member and treasurer. “In order to save our precious democracy we are prepared to file more referendum petitions in the coming weeks.” Please give us a few dollars if you can. secure.actblue.com/… Or signup to help: secure.everyaction.com/... In June Arizona Deserves Better previously filed a referendum petition for HB 1485 a bill that abolishes the popular Permanent Early Voting List (PEVL) and sets up another list that would allow voters to be purged. The rules of who stays on the new list are tricky taking into consideration not only how often they vote but how they cast their ballot. Under the new bill it’s considered a black mark against a person’s place on the list if they vote at the polls. “Arizonans built PEVL with their volunteer efforts to get people signed up and with their tax dollars – to the point where more than 80% of Arizona voters use this very efficient system” Kramer said. “No wonder the Legislature is desperate to mess it up.” The successor to PEVL would be called the AEVL list. Government notices would be sent to people based on their frequency of early voting. People who are mailed notices would be required to respond to stay on the list. If enough signatures are gathered for the petition the people of Arizona will be able to vote to prevent this bill from becoming law and keeping the PEVL. “By creating so many voter suppression bills it is clear that the majority in the state legislature plan to obstruct democracy and the will of its people at every opportunity” said State Sen. Jamescita Peshlakai D-Cameron. “We should be thankful that Arizona Deserves Better is here to save democracy and to stand up against those who wish to destroy our freedom.”
