L, Covid-19 Honor Roll/Scorecard -- May 2, Irontortoise, 2021-05-03, This is my bi-weekly Covid-19 Honor Roll/Scorecard using a 4-week average for both per capita weekly fatalities (D/1M) and new cases  (C/1M) that when added together (after multiplying D/1M by 100) yields a raw score that is then divided by a log-based Test modifier to yield a Current Score for each Nation/State/Province of at least 300000 population. These Current Scores serve as qualifiers for the following grade lists which are downgraded half a step if the product of the differences between the current and peak weekly deaths and new cases (DW*CW) fails to meet a specified threshold (penalizing those currently at or near peak fatalities and/or new cases) along with the bi-weekly Change in score from the prior two weeks: A+ List = 0.0 — 0.9 (DW*CW >= 80%) A List = 1 — 29 (DW*CW >= 80%) A- List = 0 — 29 (DW*CW <80%) B List = 30 — 99 (DW*CW >= 60%) B- List = 30 — 99 (DW*CW <60%) C List = 100 — 299 (DW*CW >=40%) C- List = 100 — 299 (DW*CW < 40%) D List = 300 — 999 (DW*CW >=20%) D- List = 300 — 999 (DW*CW <20%) F List = 1000 — 2999 (more or less equivalent to CDC ‘Red Zone’) F- List = 3000+ (much worse than CDC ‘Red Zone’ threshold) F— List =10000+ (an order of magnitude worse than the CDC ‘Red Zone’ threshold)  Nation or State/Prov Total Deaths 4W Ave D/1M 4W Ave C/1M Test Mod Cur Score List Grade Bi-Weekly Change Median  1795116          1686  (F)  -21  Canadian Provincial data from Gov of Canada Infobase all other data from worldometer NN = Navajo Nation  Total Deaths 4W Ave D/1M 4W Ave C/1M Test Mod Cur Score List Grade Bi-Weekly Change Median  1405812          248  (C)  29
