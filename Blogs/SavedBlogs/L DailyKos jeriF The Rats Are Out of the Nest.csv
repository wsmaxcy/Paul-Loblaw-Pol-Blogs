L, The Rats Are Out of the Nest, jeriF, 2021-04-21, They’re everywhere. Rats live in packs.  According to the experts at Terminix rats patrol their territory can travel when necessary and “generally live in groups dominated by a large male.” Sound familiar? Our ex-psychopathic-rat-in-chief has left nests across the country. These rodents are doing everything they can to continue the former guy’s agenda from racism to voting rights and white nationalism to insurrection. They take on bone-chilling names like Proud Boys Oath Boys QAnon and Three Percenters. Many pack lethal assault weapons. Using whatever power they have (think Kevin McCarthy and Marjorie Taylor Greene) they creep throughout our country with the goal of destroying Democrats and democracy (small d).  . . . a majority of House Republicans still strongly support Mr. Trump and appear determined to carry forward his combative brand of politics including his false claims of election fraud.        Nicholas Fandos The New York Times Rats have teeth that never stop growing. In fact their teeth can grow up to five inches per year and can gnaw through just about anything including Pinocchio’s nose. Ask squeaky clean Matt Gaetz who claims “I’m innocent . . . they lie about me because I tell the truth.” He doesn’t mention federal investigations about human trafficking paying for sex or sex with underage girls. Here’s the bottom line. Not all Republicans are rats but all rats are Republican. The rats constantly conjure ways to attack democracy. Consider their nature: burrowing rodents that dwell in dark holes in the subway nest in overcrowded buildings and live in garbage dumps. Don’t forget Mitch McConnell a Top Rat who openly states that he will fight Democrats “every step of the way.”  Did bipartisanship end up in a rat’s nest? Ex-prince rat Matt Gaetz claims: To sustain the Trump Revolution we must empower Trump’s champions to drive positive change [as we define it] across America. And we must defeat ‘never trump’ elements wherever we find them. Rats are big breeders like politicians with lies. The more the merrier. Everyone outside the nest is potential dinner particularly people of color women and Democrats. It’s easy according to Ted Cruz when “a good impression is great but a bad impression is better.” Where does that leave us? Too many people worship rats like at the Karni Mata Temple in India home to 15000 well-fed rodents. There’s no shortage of rat worshippers here in America. Look at what’s happening to voter suppression in states like Georgia and Texas or censuring Republicans who voice their conscience? The rule is that Republican wins increase when fewer people vote – translating to disenfranchising people of color poor people and women. Republican rodents from Georgia passed a law that forbid mobile voting (polling sites on wheels that travel to different locations) no ballot drop boxes except inside voting locations and severe limitation of voting by mail among other white nationalist assaults. The law was appropriately signed beneath a painting of a slave plantation. Perhaps the worst is making it a crime to give a bottle of water or snack to people waiting on lines to vote – lines that might be as long as 5 hours or more - in scalding heat.   “It’s sick” President Biden said. According to The Washington Post Over 24 rat-infested states are following suit. In 43 states across the country Republican lawmakers have proposed at least 250 laws that would limit mail early in-person and Election Day voting with such constraints as stricter ID requirements limited hours or narrower eligibility to vote absentee according to data compiled as of Feb. 19 by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Even more proposals have been introduced since then . . . Is this why we voted out the former guy?  If you look beyond the rats we have a “conventional” leader in Joe Biden – steady stable and grounded. He doesn’t call soldiers “suckers and losers” and works hard to clean up the trump swamp. Biden doesn’t kiss up to dictators and killers like Putin and Kim Jong-un. Instead our President actually does what he says – spreads life-saving covid-19 vaccines across America sends economy-saving cash to families offers empathy to black families and one-by-one removes the former rat’s executive orders against everything from LGBTQ gun control health care restrictions . . . the list is very long. And Mr. Biden has only been in The White House since January. We’re finally back on track.  Drown the rats and build back better.
