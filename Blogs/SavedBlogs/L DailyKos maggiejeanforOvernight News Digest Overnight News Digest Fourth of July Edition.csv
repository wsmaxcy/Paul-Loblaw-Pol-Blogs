Such resistance is particularly strong among Republicans: a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday found that 86% of Democrats but only 45% of Republicans have received at least one shot. The same poll found that a third of adults who had not had a shot said they would not or probably would not get one. Of those respondents nearly three-quarters said officials like Fauci were exaggerating the risk posed by the Delta variant. A little more than three-quarters believed they had little or no risk of contracting Covid-19. The Guardian A 2016 internal document from the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) organization lays out detailed tactics for members to use in preventing the removal of Confederate monuments and symbols including lawsuits rallies media management and political campaigns. The SCV is a neo-Confederate group dedicated to preserving what it sees as southern heritage in particular Confederate statues and war memorials. That task has become far more controversial recently amid the rise of Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests which frequently target such statues as memorials to racism and slavery. The 18-page Sons of Confederate Veterans Heritage Defense manual also castigates perceived opponents of the SCV accusing the NAACP civil rights group of spreading “hate and dissension” under the direction of “Marxists”. C/NET Carriers around the world have launched their 5G networks. Nationwide coverage is available in the US from the big three providers. Compatible smartphones are getting cheaper. The next-generation wireless technology is rapidly maturing. So let's talk about the next-next-generation wireless technology. Yes 6G. Each wireless generation lasts about a decade so 6G is a long long way from becoming reality. Maybe in 2029 we'll get a hint of a deployment. Still it's worth considering the technology that will be around the next corner and looking at what wireless researchers are thinking about in terms of its potential.

DW News The third wave of coronavirus infections is rolling through much of Africa — and it could be the most severe of the pandemic yet experts fear. The conditions on the continent could not be worse: The more contagious delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 which has already wreaked havoc in India is now spreading in Africa where it is encountering a largely unvaccinated population. According to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) just over 1% of people across the continent have been fully vaccinated and about 2.5% have received at least the first dose. By comparison across the EU at least 50% of people have now received the first dose according to the website Our World in Data and one in three already have full vaccination protection. DW News The leaders of Ethiopia's war-torn Tigray region said Sunday that they want a full withdrawal of "invading forces" before they can engage in talks with the federal government about a cease-fire. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) the regional authority that was driven out last year by Ethiopian forces and troops from neighboring Eritrea said it would accept a "cease-fire in principle" if there were guarantees of no further invasions. "Invading forces from Amhara and Eritrea must withdraw from Tigray and return to their pre-war territories" the TPLF said in the statement. The rebels said they required "ironclad guarantees that the security of our people will not be compromised by a second round of invasions." The TPLF also called for the restoration of  "the government democratically elected in Tigray with all its powers and constitutional responsibilities." Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said that preparations for demolition work are underway at the partially collapsed Florida condo ahead of the possible arrival of Tropical Storm Elsa https://t.co/QgitpV4QVV pic.twitter.com/amtSW8kCBS NPR Over the past 32 years Morning Edition has broadcast a reading of the Declaration of Independence by NPR staff as a way of marking Independence Day. But after last summer's protests and our national reckoning on race the words in the document land differently. It famously declares "that all men are created equal" even though women enslaved people and Indigenous Americans were not held as equal at the time. What then follows is a long list of grievances and charges against King George III that outline the 13 North American British Colonies' intentions to separate from Great Britain. NPR For as long as she can remember Danita Bilozaze knew that the name on her birth certificate "Danita Loth" didn't reflect her Indigenous identity. From the stories her mother recounted to her she knew that Catholic missionaries had changed her family's name. Her great-grandfather a man known as Lor Bilozaze was written into priests' logs as "Loth Bilozaze." Government record books in Canada ultimately dropped the "Bilozaze" and Loth became their surname. She never felt a connection with that name. But "Bilozaze" which means "the makers" in her native Denesuline language she said is integral to the preservation of her identity and culture as a member of the Cold Lake First Nations. Reuters HAVANA July 4 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Elsa on Sunday arrived with force in eastern Cuba whipping palms with strong winds and bringing a steady downpour along parts of the Caribbean island's southern coast as others in the region were still grappling with the fallout.
