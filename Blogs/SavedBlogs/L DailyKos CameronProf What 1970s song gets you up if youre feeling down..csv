L, What 1970s song gets you up if you're feeling down., CameronProf, 2021-04-29, Growing up on the cusp of the 70s and the 60s I am subject to great music from both decades.  I never understood the animosity towards disco. Sure some disco music was horrible so was some rock though and some jazz. Each genre has its good and its bad songs.  When things get down and I need a pick me up I oddly enough turn to music. Being a gay man one particular song always gets me up and goingâ€¦   How about you what song from the 1970s gets you going and out of a funk?
