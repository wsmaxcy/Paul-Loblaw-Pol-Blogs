L, Infrastructure! President Biden Prepares $3T Package To Reshape America, Susie Madrak, 2021-03-23, Via the NYTimes a look at how Biden and his team will address the nuts and bolts of passing this massive $3 trillion package to boost the economy reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality -- while seeking at least some Republican support (hah! Good luck with that Joe!) and the support of moderate Democrats.  Oh and they want to finance it through tax increases on corporations and the rich. The details are still fluid but the Biden administration is taking an aggressive approach to addressing climate change making American manufacturing and technology competitive with China and getting people back to work.  Biden advisors will recommend that the package be broken into pieces with Congress tackling infrastructure before turning to a second package that would include free community college universal pre-K and a national paid leave program -- and lots of big subsidies for the ACA. That weird feeling when you see the amazing and ambitious infrastructure built everywhere but here? Prepare to let go of it. If Joe Biden pulls this off America may look to the future again. Major Biden tax hikes eyed for next bill (not final) include:- Corporate rate 21->28%- Global min tax to 21%- Top income rate to 39.6% - End fossil fuel subsidies- Tax investment gains > $1M as wage income- Tax assets passed on at deathNO to SALThttps://t.co/SCpSHH5OHr — Jeff Stein (@JStein_WaPo) March 23 2021 Americans want results. We’re tired of Republicans refusing to negotiate and then complaining a bill isn’t bipartisan. Republicans are going to vote no on the bill and try to take credit for victories afterwards so don’t listen to them. Pass good bills. https://t.co/RoTyZzQV95 — Jon Hoadley (@JonHoadley) March 23 2021 Following the COVID-19 relief bill President Biden is assembling the next big White House priority a $3 trillion package for infrastructure and other domestic needs. If blocked by Republicans Democrats in Congress have signaled that they'll go it alone. https://t.co/DIIAiNJoxL — The Associated Press (@AP) March 23 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
