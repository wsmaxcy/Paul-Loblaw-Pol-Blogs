L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Eric "E.J." Parker, republicinsanity, 2021-04-30, Welcome to what is the 981st profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Eric “EJ” Parker who ran for District 26 of the Idaho State Senate in 2020 and yes was a member of the 3% Militia group that pointed assault rifles at government agents from the Bureau of Land Management during the standoff at Cliven Bundy’s ranch in 2014. Of course Parker was charged and plead guilty to misdemeanors to avoid jail time.Eric Parker then spent several months trying to whip up Islamophobia in rural Oregon in “anti-refugee protsts” and in January of 2016 Parker took part in the occupation at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge.So of course he found allies within the Idaho GOP like Heather Scott who thought that it would be great to try an elect an anti-government domestic terrorist into the Idaho State Senate. Because that makes sense.Facebook however did not find Parker’s candidacy so innocent removing him and all of his campaign pages from their platform in August of 2020 as part of a sweep that removed those who would use violent rhetoric and encouraging violence against the government. The scary part is Eric Parker was not completely rejected by voters in his attempt to overthrow the government from within still getting 44% of the vote in 2020. It bears watching to see if there are fans of chaos in the GOP who would still like to insert insurrectionists directly into the legislature.       One Year Ago April 30th 2020: Robert Hyde (CT)Two Years Ago April 30th 2019: Matt Manweller (WA)Three Years Ago April 30th 2018: Joel Kleefisch (WI)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago April 30th 2017: Joel Kleefisch (WI)… 2017 UpdateFive Years Ago.
