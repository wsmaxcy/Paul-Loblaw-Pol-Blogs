L, In Unshocking News US Spends Stimulus Money On Necessities, Frances Langum, 2021-04-15, Retail sales in the US jumped a whopping 9.8% in March and sales of clothing and other necessities jumped into the double digits.  CNBC (above) noted there are indications that people are shopping at brick and mortar stores not merely online.  And a lot of stimulus is going toward BILLS.  NBC: The number of recipients looking to put their stimulus checks towards their near-term financial situation remains elevated at 67 percent according to analysis from Bankrate.com. Even those among the highest-earning households making $80000 or more annually are continuing to feel the brunt of the pandemic with nearly half saying they will spend their check in this way. “For all the talk of revenge spending and pent-up demand for travel you wouldn’t know it by seeing just 13 percent of stimulus check recipients indicating that any of the money would be spent on discretionary activities or nonessential items" said Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate. What no stock buybacks?   It's so funny it's sad how immediately analysts can see the impact of trickle-UP economics.  Yes corporations like WalMart and Amazon are getting rich off of the stimulus and at the same time American households get things like diapers groceries and blue jeans.  It's a win-win.   More like this please.  If news that 67% of recipients are spending the #covid relief money that reached their pockets on food bills and other necessities is *actually news* to you — you haven't paid attention to the suffering of the American people this past year. #HelpIsHerehttps://t.co/tccalasmo6 — Nancy Pelosi (@TeamPelosi) April 14 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
