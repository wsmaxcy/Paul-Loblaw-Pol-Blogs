L, Tucker "soup plutocrat" Carlson even further unhinged, annieliformoranbetterDemocrats, 2021-04-21, If Tucker Carlson brags about beating up a gay man and/or liked junk food in high school shouldn’t he clear that up among other strange tropes like the George Floyd verdict attacking Western Civilization. Here are all the mentions of Carlson in his senior year. Anyone know what the Dan White Society is? Can't be THAT Dan White right? pic.twitter.com/5h4y8L7ADz Tucker Carlson says protests intimidated Derek Chauvin jury into guilty verdict: "Please don’t hurt us" https://t.co/wtUdpGgX2x After a jury convicted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of murder and manslaughter on Tuesday in the death of George Floyd Fox New host Tucker Carlson suggested they weren’t swayed by the testimony of more than three dozen witnesses or visceral video of Floyd pleading “I can’t breathe.” Instead Carlson argued the jurors were intimidated into the guilty verdict by the months of racial justice protests that followed Floyd’s death. “The jurors in the Derek Chauvin trial came to a unanimous and unequivocal verdict this afternoon: ‘Please don’t hurt us’” Carlson said on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Carlson added "Everyone understood perfectly well the consequences of an acquittal in this case. After nearly a year of burning and looting and murder by BLM that was never in doubt.” www.washingtonpost.com/... Tucker Carlson had a complete meltdown tonight in response to a former New York corrections officer who criticized Derek Chauvin for using excessive force on George Floyd. Here's how the interview (abruptly) ended. pic.twitter.com/mBOxrsbhaJ Fox News host Tucker Carlson behaved strangely on the air Tuesday night. Near the end of his show about the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd Carlson laughed maniacally then abruptly ended an interview with a guest who dared to criticize police use of excessive force. Carlson who spent months spreading lies about Floyd’s death and railing against the Black Lives Matter movement it reignited invited former New York corrections official Ed Gavin on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to speak after the verdict. “I want the police to protect people” Gavin said. “But specifically what we’re dealing with here is a person in custody he was handcuffed and subdued. At that point we have to take a different tact.” www.huffpost.com/... For a good example of this derangement see this. Tucker Carlson simply cuts off the conversation when an alternate sentiment intrudes. Notably Tucker claims ludicrously that because of protests against police violence the whole country is "boarded up."https://t.co/OOdav4ZSKi  Tucker Carlson is like the Joker but racist and more destructive pic.twitter.com/ZkdlYAsmBu  “This is the mainstreaming of neo-Nazi hatred in America."My 5-minute monologue tonight on the @MehdiHasanShow on the dangerous embrace of 'great replacement theory' and white supremacist rhetoric by Tucker Carlson enabled by Fox and the Murdochs: pic.twitter.com/wPB5ou847F     Tucker Carlson Insists Every White Supremacist In America Could Fit In Stadium But That Tickets To TuckerCon Won’t Last https://t.co/h69rM4Luur pic.twitter.com/7FAjS4tKi6  "White Replacement" promoted by Inbred Son of Soup Plutocrats Tucker Swanson Carlson is fallacious theory of demographic change based on mistaken belief that such people are worth replacing. pic.twitter.com/5iC4fQxiI6
