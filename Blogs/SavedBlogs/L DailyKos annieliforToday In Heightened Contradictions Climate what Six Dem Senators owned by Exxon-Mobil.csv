L, Climate what? Six Dem Senators owned by Exxon-Mobil, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-07-02,  (Bloomberg) -- A fire has broken out near Pemex’s Ku Maloob Zaap offshore platform complex after a submarine pipeline valve broke leaking oil into the country’s Gulf Coast. A video posted on social media showed three ships trying to suffocate a fire emerging from the sea very close to an offshore platform. A Pemex representative didn’t respond to a request for comment or confirm the video footage. The fire has been controlled and no injuries reported according to a person with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be named because they aren’t allowed to comment publicly. www.rigzone.com/... The company that set the Gulf of Mexico on fire has sucked the easiest-to-extract oil out of the seafloor seen production fall off and as a result is failing financially with $114 billion in debt https://t.co/FHfu0xMTOj pic.twitter.com/HAkjGmH0d1  “However as key pillars of the required changes in provisioning run contrary to the dominant political-economic regime a broader transformation of the economic system may be required to prioritise and organise provisioning for the satisfaction of human needs at low energy use.” NEW PAPER #openaccessTo secure decent living standards for all while reducing global energy use to avert #climatebreakdown governments need to:↗️public services↗️income equality↘️extractive industries❌economic growth in affluent countriesTHREADhttps://t.co/eaJF0CVW8V pic.twitter.com/pcNQ8eZ2KA  While many oil companies are diversifying with natural gas it appears ExxonMobil is going all-in battling to keep "big oil" alive and well. "Keith McCoy is a senior ExxonMobil lobbyist on Capitol Hill and has represented the company in its liaison with the U.S. Congress for the last eight years" explained the report. "Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not" said McCoy on camera. "Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes that's true. But there's nothing there's nothing illegal about that. We were looking out for our investments. We were looking out for our shareholders." McCoy compared his work with elected officials to fishing with ExxonMobil who supplies the "bait" before it "reels in" the official on issues like a carbon tax electric cars taxation and infrastructure. "When you have an opportunity to talk to a member of Congress I liken it to fishing right? You know you have bait you throw that bait out. And they say: 'Oh you want to talk about infrastructure yeah'" McCoy continued. "And then you start to reel them in and you start to have these conversations about federal leasing programs you start to have these conversations about a carbon tax. You know it's all these opportunities that you use and to use the fishing analogy again just to kind of reel them in." [...] He went on to explain that the last thing they want is to appear in a public hearing before Congress where the American people can see.

Exxon's been burying the truth for 50 years often using killer tobacco's tactics of phony science and propaganda to delegitimize legitimate science based arguements for obscene profits. https://t.co/ZQjT9XPBvG  "[Progressive Democrats] aren't calling it the 'bipartisan plan'...they're calling it the 'Romney-Exxon' plan. Exxon is very happy about this plan. It was just reported Exxon has been secretly lobbying this group of Senators...to do the least amount possible." -@_WaleedShahid pic.twitter.com/ERx5Njidzs
