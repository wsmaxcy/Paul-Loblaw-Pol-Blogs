L, MLB move of the All-Star Game will cost Atlanta "100 million jobs" so says Chuck Grassley, AKALib, 2021-04-20, Seriously this is what Sen. Chuck Grassley said - “Most infamously Major League baseball moved the All-Star game from Atlanta a move that is like to cost the city’s economy a 100 million jobs ...”. This was at the Senate Judiciary hearing on election laws today titled “Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote.” Chuck Grassley claims MLB moving the All-Star Game from Georgia cost the state "100 million jobs" pic.twitter.com/bEHQvTEK25 Perhaps he meant something else but he was reading from a sheet of paper. Should we thank some mischievous staffer for writing it and making Sen. Grassley look like a fool? But this seems to be a common viral disease with republicans of all stripes these days — exaggerate lie pull stuff out of their *** — after all their base couldn’t care less since they could not tell you the population of Atlanta or Georgia or that of the United States. The reactions make up for a fun-filled Tuesday. Nothing serious but a break from the weighty matters of the week — the Floyd trial Infrastructure Climate Summit Earth Day American Jobs Plan American Families Plan helicopters on Mars and space travel to the ISS. Dave Weigel makes a good point — can’t Georgia republicans allow water in voting lines in exchange for 100m jobs? Gaffe aside couldn't the state have gotten the All-Star Game back by - just spitballing here - repealing the law MLB complained about https://t.co/gXxz3JfQUc Does Grassley have a time machine? The year is 2050. Everyone in the US works for either Major League Baseball the National Football League or SBNation. https://t.co/JcD4X2wbb7 Forget hamburger flipping hot dog rolling is the future! "everyone with their own hot dog bin and bud light dispenser" = biblical image of the promised land I think MLB — the job creator! I still work for the 1996 All-Star Game. Atlanta’s population is 488800; that of Georgia 10.6 million. That or a third of the country moved to GA overnight.... Still trying to make sense of the 100m number … 😄  There’s 100 million dead brain cells in Chuck’s head though People misunderestimate the job-creation power of MLB :) A lot of preparation goes into the MLB All-star game Denver we got a problem. A nice one. But this means another state will get 100000000 jobs (by Senator Grassley’s estimation). Because the All-Star Game is still happening this time in Colorado.Also unlike Georgia the state of Colorado is not trying to cancel voters. https://t.co/ICQnea7dJd You can watch the Senate Judiciary hearing on election laws titled “Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote” here -
