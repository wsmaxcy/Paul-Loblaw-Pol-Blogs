L, Tweets of the Week May 2-8 2021, oldhippiedude, 2021-05-09, Last week I discovered that there are quite a few folks who fact-check the TOTW poll items. This is clearly a good thing—fact-checkers are always needed and desirable.* But it did result in a little embarassment for yours truly when a story I saw on local TV turned out not to be verifiable by any of the usual means.  This was obviously the result of a George Soros directed coverup by the nefarious liberal media and totally not something I either misremembered or hallucinated. Nonetheless all of this week’s poll items have been carefully and meticulously verified by the dedicated staff of TOTW. Many thanks to those of you who check these things because after all they’re only funny if they’re true. And now on to this week’s examples of the GOP’s adorable attempts to be real grown-up political figures. Man I love these Republicans. I keep getting smarter and they stay just as dumb. North Korea called Obama 'a monkey' in 2014 and ever since American racists don’t know who they're supposed to root for. Anti-gay evangelical want to fill the Dallas Cowboys’ stadium with 80000 anti-gay evangelical men.With that concentration of anti-gay evangelical men Grindr is going to overload and shortcircuit. https://t.co/auZxXhuTbd Imagine belonging to a group of supposed humans where this guy is considered the alpha. pic.twitter.com/qow3nbEUEZ It is inadvisable to do this to the vaccine. https://t.co/wUimxfWbut Just once I'd like to see someone report from Mar-a-Lago that the house manager is soaking in a bitter bath of his own bile. The people still defending Trump at this point are like the band on the Titanic if they had kept playing from the bottom of the ocean. Liz Cheney should invite Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise go hunting with her dad.
