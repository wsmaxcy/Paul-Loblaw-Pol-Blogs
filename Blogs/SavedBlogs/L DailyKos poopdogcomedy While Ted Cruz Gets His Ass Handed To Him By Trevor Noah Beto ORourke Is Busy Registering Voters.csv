L, While Ted Cruz Gets His Ass Handed To Him By Trevor Noah Beto O'Rourke Is Busy Registering Voters, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-28, Just wanted to share this: Texas Senator Ted Cruz was not a fan of a Tuesday Daily Show segment and he let host Trevor Noah know it. The bit was about Congressional reapportionment due to population shifts in the U.S. Those shifts are causing New York to lose a U.S. House seat while Texas picks up two. Noah made no mention of Cruz but the congressman nevertheless felt the need to respond. “Trevor Noah whines that people are fleeing high-tax blue states & moving in droves to low-tax states like Texas where the jobs are” wrote Cruz. “Doesn’t understand why people like freedom.” Here’s some more info: The 2020 Census: New York gets screwed out of a House seat Texas is the big winner and we’re back in the 1930s. pic.twitter.com/nxxd2Cp6iF  On Wednesday "The Daily Show" posted a video of host Trevor Noah talking about the 2020 Census results explaining how New York lost a seat and Texas gained two. The caption read "The 2020 Census: New York gets screwed out of a House seat Texas is the big winner and we're back in the 1930s." In the video Noah says the American population grew at the slowest rate since the 1930s. He believes it's because immigration is down and the birthrate is falling – here he shows a picture of Cruz joking that the photo of the senator is the reason for the decline in the birth rate.  Cruz wasn't keen on the jab so he tweeted the video writing that "Trevor Noah whines that people are fleeing high-tax blue states & moving in droves to low-tax states like Texas where the jobs are." Trevor Noah of course hit back in the best way: Not sure I'd be using the words "fleeing" and "Texas" in the same sentence Senator Cancun https://t.co/hgRsrN11vQ Then Cruz tried to outsmart Noah but enter Jon Stewart: Cruz chimed back with “I wear your scorn with pride” and added “I remember when the Daily Show was funny.” Ummm...you remember last night?? Bravo.  That inspired the show’s former host Jon Stewart to offer his thoughts to Cruz. And with that Ted Cruz has officially fought back harder against a tweet from a late night show than he ever did when Trump called his wife ugly https://t.co/auWBOXEebh   Good stuff. Meanwhile the person Texas should’ve elected to the U.S. Senate former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D. TX) is busy registering voters so Texas can stop electing clowns like Cruz. Received this e-mail today from O’Rourke on behalf of his organization Powered By People: I'm reaching out about SB 7 and HB 6 two voter suppression bills being pushed by Texas Republicans in the state legislature. Last month Powered by People helped organize hundreds of people to testify against these bills in the Texas capitol. Folks drove from all over - as far away as El Paso Nacogdoches and Del Rio - to stand up for the right to vote. They shined a light on legislation that would make it harder for Texans with disabilities working Texans and Texans of color to vote and gave us a fighting chance to stop it by mobilizing public sentiment. Will you help fund this work and support these courageous Texans standing up for voting rights by making a donation?  Contribute $35  Texas is already the most voter suppressed state in the country and these bills will make it even tougher for people to vote. They include provisions that would restrict early voting access make it harder for Texans with disabilities to get assistance to vote and would give “poll watchers” free rein to intimidate voters. With our democracy at stake Powered by People volunteers are doing all we can to fight back. We’re testifying at public hearings engaging with voters across the state and signing up to register voters in record numbers ensuring that we are ready to meet future voters where they are and get them on the rolls. Join us in this work to preserve democracy and fight for voting rights in Texas with a donation of $35 today. Grateful to have you in this fight with us. Beto Click here to donate to Powered By People’s efforts.
