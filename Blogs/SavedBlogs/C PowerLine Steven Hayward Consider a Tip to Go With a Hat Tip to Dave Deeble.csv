C, Consider a Tip to Go With a Hat Tip to Dave Deeble, Steven Hayward, 2021-02-15, With Ammo Grrll David Deeble is Power Line’s other unofficial comedian and you can follow his daily quips on Twitter his longer form humor articles on Ricochet and his own website and you can find lots of him on his YouTube channel. (My favorite and very topical 10-second joke at the clip below.) Pretty sure he contributes to the Babylon Bee from time to time too. Today he offers “Americans Forced to Work Job Just to Put Food on Table.” A husband and father to three children Dan Allen has been receiving a vast array of city state and federal unemployment benefits since being furloughed from his job when the COVID-19 crisis struck last March. Nevertheless Mr. Allen and millions of Americans just like him are learning the hard way that government largesse just isn’t enough. Shortly after the initial lockdown last spring Allen decided to swallow his pride and return to work. “I’m not proud of it. But my wife and I sat down and crunched the numbers and there was no way around it: I was going to have to begin earning again” he said. Policymakers in Washington are struggling to deal with a problem which has been perplexing public officials since the New Deal: how to keep people from relying on work to support themselves? Anyway here’s the thing: Dave is an actual working comedian who makes his living from public appearances in comedy clubs on cruises and on Power Line wine weekend retreats that are still purely notional. (I swear once LBJ’s criminal war in Vietnam the COVID pandemic is over we’re going to put something together.) Needless to say he hasn’t been working much for almost a year now. So he’s set up a “buy me a cup of coffee” jar and if you’re so inclined go over and send him a cup of J. . .  well let’s not call it that any more so long as we have Slow Joe in the White House. Anyway I think the “cup of coffee” is convertible into other other things—debentures perhaps I don’t know.  Did I mention he also does magic tricks? When we get our Power Line retreat put together someday I’ll dust off my own magic trickery and we’ll do a duo act perhaps. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
