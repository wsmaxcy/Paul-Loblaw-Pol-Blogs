L, John Oliver Reminds Us That Prisons Are Literally Cooking People To Death, Susie Madrak, 2021-06-14, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  As most of us sit in relative comfort you just knew John Oliver was going to ruin it for us right? That we wouldn't be allowed to sit in air-conditioned homes without also learning that prison inmates were dying because apparently no one wants to spend the money to offer them relief from the deadly heat? Via the A.V. Club: Specifically Oliver’s bait-and-switch focused on the fact that some of the hottest places in the country house untold thousands of human beings in sweltering conditions where the heat index has been measured at 150 degrees and where an increasingly aging and chronically ill population is acutely susceptible to everything from heatstroke to heat-exacerbated heart attack to a documented summertime rise in self-harm and suicide. As Oliver notes in the closing of his typically furious and funny exposé on prison heat (and not the 1993 film of the same name whose IMDb synopsis promises that “Four American babes on vacation in the Middle East run into trouble”) the solution is refreshingly simple. “We shouldn’t be cooking prisoners to death—the end” states Oliver noting that simply air conditioning America’s hottest prisons and jails will alleviate that particular social ill quite neatly. “I know this show has trained you to anticipate nuance” admits Oliver “but this one is really pretty straightforward.” So easy fix right? Well no of course not. As Oliver notes the intentionally cruel and racially biased nature of mass incarceration in this country aside (and that’s a big “aside”) the people in charge of prisoners’ safety aren’t so much interested in prisoner safety when it comes to among other things preventing them from literally cooking to death. Take Texas which has spent over $7 million on a lawsuit to stop one of its prisons from installing AC even though actually going ahead and putting in air conditioning would cost $4 million. Plucking some Texas officials out for this week’s representative villains Oliver played a clip of Texas State Senator John Whitmire explaining concerning the simple solution of AC for the incarcerated “One we don’t want to. Number two we couldn’t afford it if we wanted to.” As Oliver points out one—everything after “We don’t want to” is bullshit. Especially since—number two—Oliver’s already shown how “we couldn’t afford it” is utter and complete bullshit. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
