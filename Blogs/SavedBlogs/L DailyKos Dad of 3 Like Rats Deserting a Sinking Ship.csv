L, Like Rats Deserting a Sinking Ship, Dad of 3, 2021-06-30, Almost two years ago I described in a Daily Kos item the indignant reaction of a Republican acquaintance following my social media post highlighting the connection between the “stupidity of so many Republicans”  and the Trump phenomenon in the runup to the 2016 election.     Today’s GOP: It’s Not Just the Stupidity – It’s the Hypocrisy Lying and Craven Immorality As Well  My social media post referred to an earlier Daily Kos item noting the connection between the rise of Trump and the economic ignorance of a majority of Republican voters.  My acquaintance — a former Senate staffer and a presidential appointee to a federal commission — vehemently disagreed with my characterization about certain supporters of his party despite the incontrovertible evidence confirming the economic ignorance of a majority of Republican voters.  Despite my assurance that I didn’t intend to offend and my acknowledgment that the  “stupid” Republicans did not include him he doubled down on his arrogant and vicious attacks on me.  His wife a notorious gossip whose intellectual challenges apparently include an inability to distinguish fact from fiction soon began a campaign of disparaging and defamatory comments about me that eventually led to my deconversion from Christianity.   Shortly after my initial exchange with this acquaintance and just days after Trump accepted the 2016 Republican nomination he was quoted in a press release from a Republican-linked industry group praising the GOP’s “forward thinking and optimistic” history and mission.  As someone who brags on his LInkedin profile of having “served two [Republican] United States Senator’s” (sic) from his home state earlier in his career this acquaintance clearly was all-in with the GOP as evidenced by his political contribution history in Federal Election Commission records.  Those records reflect donations exclusively to Republican candidates — including a donation to one former Senator who was trying to resurrect his political career more than ten years after leaving office and experiencing multiple political failures in another state.   I tried to play nice with this acquaintance by offering to reconcile but the campaign of defamation engineered by his wife made reconciliation impossible.  For years I suffered from the wounds inflicted by their arrogant attitudes and their inability to recognize their own faults.   In the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election in the midst of the bizarre conspiracy theories promoted by Republicans involving among other things “releasing the kraken”  I sent my acquaintance a message asking  if he still thought the biggest threat to American democracy is someone pointing out "the stupidity of so many Republicans”.  Keep in mind that this was over three years after any direct communication from me in a period when Republicans at all levels were forcefully attempting to undermine the legitimacy of the recent election.    The reaction of my acquaintance?  He did what any self-respecting pompous ass would do — he tried to get me fired. As if trying his best to prove my point about his own arrogance and obnoxiousness the acquaintance reached out to an executive at my employer making false and defamatory accusations about my alleged “harassment”.   It was the perfect illustration of the truth of my criticism of him from years earlier — his arrogance condescension and unwillingness to give an inch to promote reconciliation makes dealing with him impossible.  What is it that causes someone to engage in such brazenly tortious behavior in response to such an innocuous inquiry?  Did my earlier comments hit a sore spot when I so accurately assessed his character?   I’m not the first person to note his troublesome nature.   After leaving the federal commission to which he had been appointed a public watchdog group noted that my acquaintance had voted on matters affecting companies with which he was seeking employment.  The agency’s Inspector General found that my acquaintance violated federal ethics laws by failing to recuse himself.  Although the agency referred the matter to the Justice Department for civil action and to the U.S. Attorney’s office for criminal action neither office pursued the matter.   During the course of the investigation interviews with former colleagues revealed that my acquaintance had been excessively touting his accomplishments and one noted that his self-promoting tendency was a common occurrence.   In other words his sense of self-importance stretched back many years and my perception of his character was spot-on. When I attempted reconciliation with my acquaintance years ago I explained:  I have repeatedly stated . . .  that the takeover of the Republican Party by theTrump forces is based in part on the significant level of misunderstanding and/or disinformation about our nation cultivated by the Republican leadership and their allies in the media. The irrational hatred of the Clintons the birtherist attacks on the legitimacy of Obama the stoking of Tea Party rage and the unrelenting obstructionism of Mitch McConnell and his allies have all contributed to the mess that the Republicans and our nation as a whole now find ourselves in. That seems self-evident to me and I would have thought that you are honest and intelligent enough to find common ground with me on that point. Of course my acquaintance would have none of that — his party like himself was above criticism.  Not realizing that I would eventually learn of his complaint to my employer my acquaintance responded to my inquiry by pretending to distance himself from his Republican past.  He noted that he had changed his voter registration to “unaffiliated” and that his family had actively opposed Trump in the 2020 election.   What he failed to do is acknowledge that his decades-long support of the GOP helped create the conditions for the takeover of the party by Trump just as I had explained years ago.   Perhaps one less registered Republican is a victory for American democracy but it seems to me that the better result would be having someone within the GOP willing to confront the evils of Trumpism and the party’s recent sordid past.   At least then we might observe a legitimate honest and genuine party willing to work with others to build a better nation.  Not surprisingly however my acquaintance was not up to the task.  I think we are all worse off as a result.
