C, Gov. Noem won’t sign bill protecting female athletes, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-20, The South Dakota legislature passed a bill banning individuals who were male at birth from competing in girls’ and women’s sports both at the high school and the college levels. However Governor Kristi Noem has  refused to sign the legislation as passed.  Noem favors the ban as applied to high school sports but not as applied to college. Accordingly invoking her power to make style and form changes to the bill Noem has in effect re-written it to excise the ban on biological men competing against women in college sports. According to  this report when the South Dakota makes style and form changes as opposed to exercising veto power the revised bill can be enacted by a simple legislative majority vote.  However it seems obvious that Noem’s change is neither to style nor form. It’s a substantive re-write and a significant watering down. Noem  enthusiastically supported the bill as written at the time of passage by the legislature. However she changed her mind. Why? She  says “as I have studied this legislation and conferred with legal experts over the past several days I have become concerned that this bill’s vague and overly broad language could have significant unintended consequences.” (Emphasis added) She added: 
Overall these style and form clarifications protect women sports while also showing empathy for youths struggling with what they understand to be their gender identity. But showing empathy does not mean a biologically-female-at birth woman should face an unbalanced playing field that effectively undermines the advances made by women and for women since the implementation of Title IX in 1972.
 But if biologically-female-at-birth women face an unbalanced playing field when they compete at the high school level against people who were born biologically-male don’t they also face an unbalanced field when they do so as soon as a year later at the college level? Supporters of the bill say Noem has bowed to outside economic pressure. This may have been what Noem had in mind when she spoke of “unintended consequences” of the legislation. Business interests have  cited loss of economic opportunities for the state as an unintended consequence. There is concern in particular over the NCAA refusing to hold tournaments in South Dakota if this legislation is enacted. According to  this report South Dakota hosts the Summit League men’s basketball tournament as well as Division I women’s basketball and hockey regionals and Division II wrestling basketball and volleyball championships.  It’s very likely that the NCAA would refuse to hold such tournaments in South Dakota if the bill as passed by the legislature goes into effect. Noem’s revisions would remove any claim that South Dakota is out of compliance with NCAA competition rules.  However Noem’s compromise  hasn’t satisfied the woke left. It wants the whole loaf of bread. Thus even with Noem’s changes the state would very likely face economic repercussions. Whether the NCAA would still seek to punish the State is unclear at least to me. I guess Noem believes it wouldn’t or would be substantially less likely to. My view is that if the bill passed by the legislature is good policy it should be signed into law without being watered down. The left is destined to win the culture war in a rout if corporate America can cause political leaders to back down out fear of their states being boycotted.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
