L, The Language of the Night: COVID-19 Edition, DrLoriforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-04-19, For the past two weeks we’ve been enjoying Jeffersonian Democrat’s discussions about Tolkien and the Legendarium Northern Courage wyrd and the Second Age. If you missed it here are the first two installments of his series: As he told us in comments last week JD has Covid — a mild case but even a mild case is nothing to make light of. So he’s recuperating and I really don’t have a lot to write about tonight. I mean I started a screed about “Anglo-Saxon” and its cooption by the White Supremacist movement but I wrote for two hours and it went nowhere. If you’re interested in the intersection between medieval studies and the far right I suggest you follow Axel Folio on Twitter since she’s an incredible scholar and she’ll point you toward studies and sources that demonstrate the medieval period in Europe was nowhere as white or homogeneous as you’ve been led to believe in school.  Here's a short thread to exemplify how the term "Anglo-Saxon" is used to mean 'wyte' associated w/ wyte supremacy & misused not only by Americans but equally by British ppl & also scholars. Before you steal my work cite me. Here we go: #medievaltwitter 1/ pic.twitter.com/E1zX0W36Ps Then you can look at Newsweek for a look back on how “Anglo-Saxon” was beloved of White Supremacists from way back. And finally just to make your favorite “Anglo-Saxon” nutjob neighbor’s blood boil there’s this documentary that asserts the ancient Irish were dark-hued and blue-eyed. All of that’s from today. So if you want to talk about Anglo-Saxonism and why it doesn’t accurately describe the Old English we can do that. Or we can talk about this article from Tor by Jeff LaSala “Tolkien’s Orcs: The Din-horde of Morgoth” which is a deeper and more perceptive dive into Sauron’s storm troopers than I expected it would be. I wish Jefferson Democrat well and hope he recovers quickly. I know he wants to share his work and when he’s up to it he will.
