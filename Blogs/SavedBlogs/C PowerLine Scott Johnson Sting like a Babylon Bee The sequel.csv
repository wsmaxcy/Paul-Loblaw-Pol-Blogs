C, Sting like a Babylon Bee: The sequel, Scott Johnson, 2021-06-16, I took a look at the New York Times’s drive-by defamation of the Babylon Bee last week in “Sting like a Babylon Bee.” The Times disparaged the Bee as a a “far-right misinformation site” that “sometimes trafficked in misinformation in the guise of satire.” The Bee is of course a site devoted exclusively to satire with a conservative bent. The Times’s reference to the Bee as a “far-right misinformation site” virtually defies belief. The Times compounded the error in a ridiculous update. Say this for the Times. When it comes to misinformation it speaks with the authority of a perpetrator and hard-core recidivist. Were it not for the example of the Bee itself we might think it impossible to satirize the Times. The Bee followed up with a threatening letter to the Times seeking a correction. As Tyler O’Neil relates for PJ Media the Times has finally corrected its story. Via Twitter Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon claimed victory. Big update here. The @nytimes has responded to our demand letter by removing defamatory statements about us from their article. Here's their email to our counsel notifying us of the correction. https://t.co/lv0eYo6NzK pic.twitter.com/OLi5KzMzej — Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) June 14 2021   This is huge. The NY Times was using misinformation to smear us as being a source of it. That's not merely ironic; it's malicious. We pushed back hard and won. Thanks to everyone who voiced and offered their support. We don't have to take this nonsense lying down. Remember that. — Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) June 14 2021   Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
