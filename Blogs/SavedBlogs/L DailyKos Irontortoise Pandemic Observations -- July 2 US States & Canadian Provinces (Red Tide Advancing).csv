L, Pandemic Observations -- July 2 US States & Canadian Provinces (Red Tide Advancing):, Irontortoise, 2021-07-03, While US weekly deaths from Covid-19 have now fallen well below 2000 for the first time since late March of last year weekly new infections are starting to accelerate once more.  After bottoming out at just over 80000 less than two weeks ago they’ve jumped by more than 20% in the last 11 days and appear poised to push back above the 100000 level for the first time in nearly three weeks.  Note that this latest resurgence thus far does seem to be confined mainly to those Red States with lower than average vaccination rates and the real question remains as to whether this will simply prove to be a relatively minor blip in the weekly stats or the start of an ominous new Red Wave in our portion of the pandemic. Note also that Canada has finally overtaken the US in total doses of vaccine administered per 100 residents overall despite a much later start in getting their vaccination program up and running. 7-Day D/1M 7-Day Deaths Weekly Change Change fr Max 7-Day C/1M 7-Day Cases Weekly Change Change fr Max Tests %Pos Doses /100 Canada  3.7  141  -19%  -89%    Canada  109  4091  -17%  -93%  1.4%  101.8  Weekly New Deaths Table <   > Weekly New Cases Table D/1M = Covid-19 deaths per 1 million population over prior 7 days C/1M = New Covid-19 cases per 1 million population over prior 7 days Weekly Change = Net change from previous week's stats Change fr Max = Net change from week of peak deaths or new cases Tests %Pos = Portion of current week’s tests resulting in positive (confirmed) Covid-19 case Doses/100 = Vaccine doses administered per 100 people NN = Navajo Nation (population estimate 180000) USA data derived from worldometer Canadian data from Canada Covid-19 Interactive Data Vaccine data from ourworldindata
