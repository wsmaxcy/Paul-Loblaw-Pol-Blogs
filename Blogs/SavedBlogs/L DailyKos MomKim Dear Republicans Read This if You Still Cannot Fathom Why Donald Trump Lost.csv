L, Dear Republicans Read This if You Still Cannot Fathom Why Donald Trump Lost, MomKim, 2021-05-01, Republicans are having a hard time to accept Joe Biden’s win many of them still cannot digest the fact that their beloved leader has been thrown out of power. If you are one of those Republicans then please read though this article to get a hint why Americans chose Joe Biden over Donald Trump. If you ever wonder what Donald Trump gave America during his 4 years in power the chances are you will come across only negatives. Racism inequality and white supremacist violence increased significantly in the US during his tenure not only that he made some serious human rights violations by separating migrant children from their families as part of his inhumane policy. Mishandling of Covid 19 pandemic which left more than 500000 Americans dead was icing on the cake. Do you still believe Donald Trump was a better choice? Let me also remind you of the January 2021 insurrection of the Capitol just imagine an egoistic President who could not accept his defeat and made conspiracy theories that he has been cheated in the election tells his supporters to not “give up” and march towards the Capitol Hill. What followed next was a deadly attack that left 5 people including a policeman dead and hundreds were injured. Many Americans were put off by his aggressiveness and his tendency to give every matter a racist twist. His social media accounts were often used to malign people of color and consistently used racist language in his tweets. His admiration for Vladimir Putin trashing of America’s traditional allies and failure to condemn white supremacy did not get too well with the Americans. The trade war between America and China that was meant to be resolved during his presidency has significantly affected the US economy. After 4 miserable years many Americans voted for a Presidency that would restore honesty and normalcy. A President who is not racist for sure and respect people of color someone who does not like stoking racial tensions or making conspiracy theories and behave in a conventional manner. Joe Biden was hard to defeat because he is the epitome of grace and decency the qualities Donald Trump totally lacked.  According to me Americans deserve this normalcy and a President who behaves like a President and not like a clown. I hope now Republicans understand why Donald Trump lost the Presidential election.
