L, Doodle II is Finished and Beltane Blessings to All., A Pagan in Arizona, 2021-05-01, The second Doodle is finished. I have ideas for another but may wait a while before starting it. My second Covid jab is a few days from now. And if the first is anything to go by I may be out of commission for a few days after. I don't like to start a project only to have to abandon it just when it's getting interesting. Today is Beltane here in the northern hemisphere. For those who celebrate Blessed Beltane to you all! And remember that the veil is thin on this day; beware of fae folk wanting to make a deal with you. üòè For everyone else I wish you a safe healthy and happy weekend. I hope you can spend it doing something you really enjoy. In the company of people whom you love who love you.
