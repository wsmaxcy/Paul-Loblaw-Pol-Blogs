I had been thinking of a subject for this week celebrating the Fourth of July.  The heroine of Sycamore Shoals and King’s Mountain was here under my nose all along.  Mary McKeehan Patton was a great hero of the American Revolution.  The Battle of King’s Mountain was won using gunpowder made by Mary Patton.  Mary McKeehan Patton was born in England on December 15. 1751. Her father was a Scottish powder maker; however powder-making had to be licensed by the Crown in those days.  Reckon the Crown was going to let a Scotsman make black powder? Hardly.  That made David McKeehan an outlaw in England.  Being a smart guy he removed his young family to the Colony of Pennsylvania about 1760 when Mary was nine.  She had already begun learning the art of making gunpowder and was turning out to be a wizard at that obscure skill. The McKeehan family continued the family tradition of making gunpowder in Pennsylvania until the threat of being under attack by Loyalists and British troops endangered the McKeehan powdermaking enterprise.  David McKeehan soon removed his family to the hills of western North Carolina.  During this time Mary met another skilled powdermaker named John Patton. They fell in love and were married. In the mountains of western North Carolina (modern day east Tennessee) they found an ideal place to make powder finding ingredients not available to them in Pennsylvania.  Not the least of which was wood; Pine and abundant Willow ideal for making fine charcoal plus a good source of potassium nitrate (saltpeter).  A creek just south of the beautiful Watauga River provided ample flowing water for running a mill operation.  The Patton powdermaking operation flourished on Powder Branch Creek.  Although John Patton was a good powdermaker it was Mary who was the driving force and master blender.  The operation came to be known as Mary Patton’s Powder Mill due to her skill and understanding of frontier marketing. Her mill was on what is now known as Powder Branch in what is now Carter County TN.  It is only a short distance from the old Sycamore Shoals fort. Let the story be told in Mary’s own words by reenactor Lisa Bennett playing an older Mary Patton.  Marjorie Shaefer is a dear family friend. She is a Master Storyteller who was married to our local Episcopal minister Fr. Harry Shaefer.  Fr. Harry passed away recently so Marjorie has returned to their original home in the upper Midwest.  This is Marjorie Shaefer telling the story of King’s Mountain as only a Master Storyteller can tell it:   Mary Patton made 500 pounds of fine gunpowder for the Troop of Overmountain men delivering it to the Troops in September 1780 just before they left for King’s Mountain. That means every member of the Overmountain militia had at least a half pound of fine black powder.  That is a LOT of powder for a single soldier. George Washington Horatio Gates and Thomas Jefferson all said that the Battle of King’s Mountain was the turning point of the American Revolution.  Cornwallis was unable to press any attack on the southern colonies as long as that tough band of mountain men were looming at his rear. The men who came to be known as the Overmountain Men their long rifles powered by the best gunpowder in the civilized world at the time.  Gunpowder made by a brilliant woman and her apprentices on Powder Branch Creek at Sycamore Shoals. Mary Patton died December 15 1836. She is buried in the family cemetery in Carter County TN. There is a song about King’s Mountain.  This version is by Grandpa Jones.  The song has the year wrong. It was 1780 not 1781. “Sweet Lips” was what a young trooper called his long rifle.  It was “Sweet Lips” that put the first round into Major Ferguson using Mary Patton’s black powder. Wednesday Langiappe: There are a number of songs the Overmountain Men would have sung and hummed during the ten days they marched from Sycamore Shoals on the Watauga River over to King’s Mountain.  This is one of them:  This is an open thread.
