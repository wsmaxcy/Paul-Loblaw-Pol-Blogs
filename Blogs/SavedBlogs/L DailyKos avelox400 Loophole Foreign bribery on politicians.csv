L, Loophole: Foreign bribery on politicians?, avelox400, 2021-05-08, Foreign nationals and governments are prohibited from donating (bribing) politicians BUT what prevents either entity from setting up a corporation in Delaware. The Supreme Court says that corporations are people and that money is speech so why wouldn’t that corporation be allowed to put any amount of money into political campaigns? Is this why Republicans won’t sanction Russia or Saudi Arabia?  Am I wrong?
