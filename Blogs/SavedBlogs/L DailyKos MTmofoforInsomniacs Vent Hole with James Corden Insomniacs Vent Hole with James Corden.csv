Colbert:  Unspecified  repeat.  According to the outlet the show uses tickets are available for shows taping July 12 to 22.  After that who knows Corden:  Emily Blunt is spotlighted. Also: a musical performance by Elle King.  At the end of the show James made it very clear they are on break for the summer. Fallon:  Guests include Julianne Moore and Dave Bautista. Twenty One Pilots performs.  I asked a generic question and nothing appeared for Fallon and Meyers. Meyers:  Ewan McGregor and Casey Wilson appear. Kimmel:  Guests include Julianne Moore and Dave Bautista. Twenty One Pilots performs.  Kimmel is also taking the summer off but the article indicated that there would be guest hosts to some extent while he is off. SNL:  Unspecified  repeat. Managed to stay below 100 today but not by much.  Next week promises more of the same with an odd 88 thrown in for a respite day. Have a safe maybe enjoyable July 4th weekend.
