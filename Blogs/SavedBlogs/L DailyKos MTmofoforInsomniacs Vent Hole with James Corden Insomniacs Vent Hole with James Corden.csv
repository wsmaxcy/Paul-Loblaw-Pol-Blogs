Between Plains and Thompson Falls there is a stretch of Hwy 200 that runs through big horn sheep habitat.  There are a lot of warning signs viewing areas and one stretch of (I think experimental) electrified roadbed.  I’ve never stopped to piss on the pavement so I don’t know how strong it is.  The sheep cross the highway to get to the river and they lick the pavement because of whatever salt is in the stuff they put on the highway in winter. I had passed a small RV and an 18 wheeler and was booking down the highway.  I hit a long straight stretch and I could barely see these tan blobs bobbing in the distance.  As I got closer I realized it was some sheep so I did a quick flamenco dance on the brake pedal to alert the semi driver and kept slowing down as I got closer.  There were 5 young adult sheep bounding around in front of me. I was more interested in keeping an eye on them and the semi behind me so I didn’t think to grab my cell.  They were all over the place bouncing off each of each other going from one side of the road to other before they broke towards the hills and jumped a fence.  The whole thing lasted maybe half a minute it seemed longer but it was great to see.  Looking west into Idaho from Thompson Pass.  A mile down the road is where you get a glimpse of the highway at the left edge and again just above the rock sticking out of the snowbank. There was a period of time in the late 1800’s when there was gold mining in the valley below.  There’s a big stream/small river just beyond all of these spoil piles the line of trees and more piles but the piles cover a quite a few miles along the water. This place is about a half mile from the interstate.  It has quite a history lots of historic rudiments and some good grub.  It is an unofficial marker between the bustle of the modern world to the multi-faceted pursuits and lifestyles of the great outdoors beyond.
