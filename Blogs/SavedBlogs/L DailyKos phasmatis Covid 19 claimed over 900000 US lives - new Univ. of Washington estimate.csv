L, Covid 19 claimed over 900000 US lives - new Univ. of Washington estimate, phasmatis, 2021-05-09, I haven’t seen a diary about this story so I though that I would throw something out there so some other people would I see it. Here is a quote from the article: In a study published Friday researchers at the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimate that the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is almost double the official number in the US and more than twice as high as the reported worldwide tally. Using data from May 3 2021 the report says the number of reported COVID-19 deaths in the US was 574043. The authors estimate that the number was actually much higher at 905289 deaths. The researchers also said that COVID-19 deaths are significantly underreported in other countries as well bringing the global total to about 6.9 million more than double the official estimate. The article concludes that the undercount was due to a significant number of deaths occurring outside of hospitals among untested individuals and overwhelmed medical systems undercounting Covid 19 deaths. In addition there are suspicions that some states may have deliberately undercounted Covid 19 deaths in an attempt to look better to voters and the media.
