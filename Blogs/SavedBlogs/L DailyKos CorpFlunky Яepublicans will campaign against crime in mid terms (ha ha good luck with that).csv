L, Яepublicans will campaign against crime in mid terms (ha ha good luck with that), CorpFlunky, 2021-07-05, Articles reporting that Яepublicans will campaign against crime the in mid-term elections are not going away despite Jen Psaki pointing out that Яepublicans actually voted against funding the police in the American Rescue Plan (h/t Egberto Willies).  While anti-crime has long been a staple of Яepublican campaigns the public’s views have matured with many Americans now believing that the police need to be held accountable for brutality and for killing citizens needlessly.  538 reports that the public now splits fairly evenly on crime with 34% saying Trump is better and 32% saying Biden is better on crime.   The other reason I think this old campaign tactic is ridiculous is that it opens Яepublicans up to several glaring weaknesses they have on the crime issue.  They only talk about crimes committed by darker skinned people but what about all the other crimes they don’t want to solve?   The background context for carrying out the old tough on crime campaign tactic couldn’t be worse for Яepublicans.  Rudy Giuliani just lost his law license and is under criminal investigation for Ukraine dealings.  Matt Gaetz could be charged with child sex trafficking as soon as this month.  The Trump Org & CFO have already been charged with tax fraud conspiracy filing false records and grand larceny.  Trump is also under multiple investigations for tax evasion bank fraud insurance fraud money laundering election interference siphoning off inauguration funds inciting insurrection violating the Voting Rights Act violating the KKK Act defamation stealing from his family’s inheritance and more.   So every Яepublican ‘tough on crime’ campaign ad will run during news reports about recent Яepublican corruption and Trump’s cronies being charged (again).   Яepublicans biggest problem is that they have zero credibility.  They lied about the climate crisis.  They lied about tax cuts helping regular people instead of just the rich.  They lied about Covid and did little to protect 600000 Americans from dying.  They lied about the last election and lost in court virtually every time.  They lied about the insurrectionist attack on the US Capitol.   The truth is that Яepublicans oppose real police reforms oppose laws protecting our right to vote oppose laws that would force billionaires to start paying more than $0 in taxes and they even oppose laws that would stop Congressmen from engaging in insider trading.  Яepublicans are not just soft on crime they’re pro crime.
