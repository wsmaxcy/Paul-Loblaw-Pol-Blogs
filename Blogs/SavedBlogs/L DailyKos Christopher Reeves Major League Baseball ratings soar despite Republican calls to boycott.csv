L, Major League Baseball ratings soar despite Republican calls to boycott, Christopher Reeves, 2021-04-20, Republicans and conservative media outlets have argued that Major League Baseball (MLB) and sports in general are going to suffer the wrath of conservatives who will no longer give them the time of the day. Boycott the sport! MLB however has proven resilient and it appears as though the calls to bash the sport didn’t pay off for Republicans. MLB just finished releasing the update to their ever-popular MLB: The Show video game—this year is the Jackie Robinson anniversary edition. Republican boycotts certainly will hurt the MLB in every single venue where they’re attempting them right? No. In fact MLB live streams of games are up—way up—this year over last year.  From CNBC: MLB said live games on its over-the-top service MLB.TV garnered more than 1.3 billion minutes of streams from opening day April 1 through April 18. That’s a 12% increase compared with the first 18 days of the shortened 2020 season and up 43% compared with the same time frame for the 2019 season the league said in a release. MLB’s streaming service allows consumers to view out-of-market games. Fans streamed 121 million minutes of live games on opening day making it the most-watched day in MLB.TV history. While the pandemic still inhibits the level of attendance in a Republican state like Texas there were still 352503 attended games for the Rangers and Astros.  Republicans might not be pleased with these results. Sen. Grassley of Georgia proclaimed that moving the All-Star Game would cost Georgia 100 million jobs: Chuck Grassley claims MLB moving the All-Star Game from Georgia cost the state "100 million jobs" pic.twitter.com/bEHQvTEK25 I personally loved it when Kansas City hosted the All-Star Game in 2012 but it certainly didn’t generate 100 million jobs in our metro—or even 100000 jobs or 50000.
