L, Abuse Of Power: Trump DOJ Seized Data Of House Dems, Susie Madrak, 2021-06-11, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  As the Trump Justice Department looked into who was leaking reports of contacts between Trump associates and Russia prosecutors subpoenaed Apple for data from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee (including Rep. Adam Schiff) aides and family members. One was a minor. And the only reason we know this happened is that the gag order on Apple just expired. Via the New York Times: All told the records of at least a dozen people tied to the committee were seized in 2017 and early 2018 including those of Representative Adam B. Schiff of California then the panel’s top Democrat and now its chairman according to committee officials and two other people briefed on the inquiry. Representative Eric Swalwell of California said in an interview Thursday night that he had also been notified that his data had been subpoenaed. Prosecutors under the beleaguered attorney general Jeff Sessions were hunting for the sources behind news media reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Ultimately the data and other evidence did not tie the committee to the leaks and investigators debated whether they had hit a dead end and some even discussed closing the inquiry. But William P. Barr revived languishing leak investigations after he became attorney general a year later. He moved a trusted prosecutor from New Jersey with little relevant experience to the main Justice Department to work on the Schiff-related case and about a half-dozen others according to three people with knowledge of his work who did not want to be identified discussing federal investigations. This is pretty much unheard of move outside of corruption investigations. The records of lawmakers just aren't seized which tells you something about the effect Trump had on most of the people around him. They did what they were told no matter how uncomfortable they may have been. UPDATE: NEW:@RepAdamSchiff's office has repeatedly asked DOJ for info on the subpoenaing of Dems' metadata including what the legal basis is and what prompted the move.Incredibly DOJ has refused to answer a committee official tells me.New reporting here:https://t.co/7dzwsjzbNe — Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) June 11 2021 .@SenKamalaHarris: Has the president or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested you open an investigation into anyone?BARR: ..... ah .....

So assume there is a lawful predicate.  Now questions become 1) Was WH in the loop or worse in the driver's seat; & 2) Who and with what ostensible justification decided to target eg family members? — Harry Litman (@harrylitman) June 11 2021 I made this video about BILL BARR on February 16 2020.It received 1.2 million views.But watch it now in light of yesterday's shocking news about Bill Barr's corruption. https://t.co/4ItJnZ1vrV — Don Winslow (@donwinslow) June 11 2021 'William Barr was truly out of control': Legal experts stunned by Trump's DOJ spying on Democrats https://t.co/1XxsFswFvc — Raw Story (@RawStory) June 11 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
