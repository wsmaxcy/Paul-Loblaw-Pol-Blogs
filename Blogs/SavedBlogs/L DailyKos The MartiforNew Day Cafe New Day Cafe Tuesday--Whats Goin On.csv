L, New Day Cafe: Tuesday--What's Goin' On?, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-05-11, Good morning Cafe! Yesterday I mentioned a programme I saw on CNN Sunday night.  It was about Marvin Gaye’s iconic album What’s Going On hosted by Don Lemon.  If you can see it streaming or whatever it is so very worth the time. But first...have some coffee and a nosh!   / Fifty years on...the songs and the entire album deserve a revisit.  They speak to us just as they did back in the days of the Vietnam War and the beginning of the ecology movement.  Had we done the right things then imagine what our world would be like today! There is still time and there is still hope.  We just have to demand that our government do its job. As I watched and listened to Don Lemon interview so many people who knew Marvin and listened to them sing parts of the song (who knew Don could sing so well?) I got goosebumps and the memories of that time washed over me.  In the clips I couldn’t help thinking that Marvin had the saddest eyes I’ve ever seen in a man.   There is still so much work to do.  The fact that we elected a Black man President (twice!!) does not mean that we live in a post-racial society.  Almost every day I find myself questioning if I am doing enough to change things.  In my corner of the world I do try.  Is it enough?  Only God knows.  There can be much joy in the work as well as the sadness of how little things have changed. I’m including this one too…. / I regret that I couldn’t find a decent recording of the entire album but those are the vagaries of YouTube. / One more song...one of hope. /
