L, The Daily Bucket: The Marsh Supremacy: A Gray Ghost Territorial Battle, 2n10forBackyard Science, 2021-04-25, Swan Lake NSA Lemmon Valley (Reno) Nevada USA March 21 2015 This will be a photo diary as the action speaks for itself.

I waited several minutes for the birds to reappear but they did not.
