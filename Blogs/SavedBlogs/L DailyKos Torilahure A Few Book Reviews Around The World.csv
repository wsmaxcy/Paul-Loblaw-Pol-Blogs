L, A Few Book Reviews Around The World, Torilahure, 2021-05-08,  Some sources and links that might not be familiar to most kossacks what with this being a Foreign Policy and International stuffs group and all. So press right mouse button on links and open in new incognito/private tab/window to reduce your tensions somewhat. After having spent roughly an hour in a family group voice chat I needed a little bit of palate cleanser. The purpose of the call was to talk about that damned Lord of the Flies which some of the people had to write a school report or essays or some such stuff English teachers are so keen to demand.  Seriously why is it even a part of any schools English literature inclusion? I am aware some of the book lovers will be unhappy at my take on the book. I have a personal disgust towards the book which probably needs a far calmer state of mind to write about. I thought that as a soothing activity I would randomly pop into a few news/media agency places (preferably online of print papers) to check out for some titles that might be more fun. Although for me any book at random from Mills and Boon collection is more thoughtful has literary merit  and fun than Lord of the Flies. This is a sample of what I found. South Africa: First stop since I already had a tab open sitting idle with Mail & Guardian I was originally intending to look for any  It carried an extract from Tim Jenkin’s Escape from Pretoria. It is an auto-biographical book by Tim Jenkin (wiki) an anti-apartheid activist famous for escaping from Pretoria prison complex in 1978. Escape from Pretoria: ‘Our cells were on the first floor so there was nowhere to dig to’. In our first weeks at Pretoria Steve and I carefully studied the layout of the prison to see if there were any obvious cracks in the prison’s security. From our initial observations all escape routes had their origin in the prison yard. It was reasonable to think that way for once you were in the yard the only barrier between you and freedom was the yard wall. Any other starting point meant that you were placing more barriers in front of yourself not fewer. You could take your cell as the point of departure but once out of it you had to get out of the prison building and that meant into the yard. There were only four doors leading out of the actual prison building and three of them led directly into the yard. The fourth the front door led directly into the street but that was out of the question because the only way to get to it was by clean through the administrative section where the prison staff hung out and opening many doors and gates on the way. How to get out of the prison yard was another question. The yard gate although it led out of our prison opened into prison property — into the site of the old Pretoria Local that was about to be demolished. That was not useful but as the demolition progressed we thought it might begin to offer some prospects. Uganda: So that made me wonder what is nearby. I was planning on scanning various places for FP&IE Daily tomorrow so I opened our teams information sources link FP&IE - Toolkit for Daily Thread Hosts - Information Sources. I saw The Daily Monitor Uganda on the list. It had featured a review of Dream from the Soul a book  written by Edward Aaron Mugabi. I had never heard of the author before. The review seemed interesting. Although not something I was likely to read as it was about interpreting dreams and heavily Christian beyond my comfort. Although others might like it. Understand your dreams Book review: In Dreams from the Soul Edward Aaron Mugabi introduces us to the spiritual world of dreams we normally have. Dreams are either about our past or foretell our future.  In this book the author shows how impactful these dreams can be writes Promise Twinamukye. Dreams From the Soul by Edward Aaron Mugabi is a book that inspires one to start paying attention and praying over the different dreams  they get. The book is one of the several books by the same author in which he shares his wealth of knowledge from different scriptures with intention to make the reader understand better the root causes of the different dreams and scriptures to enable one create connection with prayer and overcome the different dreams or understand their spiritual meaning. It should also be noted that throughout his book Mugabi anchors many of his insights on Christian biblical references which propose that it is every Christian’s duty to understand the root cause of different dreams since God speaks through dreams and visions.   Nigeria: Hmmm so far one auto-biography and one dream/religion. Feeling a little let down I popped into The Guardian (NG) with very little expectation. As far as I could recall they usually have some textbook or some such on hefty subject of economics or something. I thought well whats the big deal let me see who has written the book on Nigerian economics not that I was likely to know them. A thought arrived  hey I could maybe drop a smug comment from theb blurb of the book should my friend who happens to be a Nigerian Prince and writes to me very frequently need my help with laundering money and smuggling gems out of the country. I was already slightly pleased that I decided to check in. This checking out reviews seemed fun thing after all. It was beginning to take a shape of a treasure hunt with a scrap of map. Guardian Nigeria had this review of a poem anthology. I am pretty confident I would be able to impress my friend with my knowledge of poetry literature in the news. Bayo Ogunmupe had this review column Sandra Belema in a cup of tea. Woot this felt like hint of a treasure. It sounds like a book I might asctually buy. Cup of Tea is the title of an anthology of poems written by Sandra Belema Ekine. The entire collection is considered Belema scribbles. It is a paperback collection of 118 pages 60 poems and 15 paintings in pictures. Published in 2020 by Livingstream and Branches Publishing the foreword to the anthology is written by Kesiena Aiwemhenle. Among the genres of literature poetry is the most recondite and difficult to understand. It is written with various figures of speech. Other branches or genres of literature are: fiction fantasy science fiction mystery biography drama and non-fiction. I am one of a few literature students who like poetry. This is because from an early age I used to speak in puns metaphor allegory hyperbole and innuendos which is why I love reading poems at my leisure hours. In reading the Cup of Tea anthology my love of literature was rekindled. What fascinated me in this author’s collection was the openness of the poems to varying interpretations. Beyond rhymes and lyrics the poems ignited in the reader new vistas of epistemological systems of analytical reasoning and cognition. The author Sandra wrote these poems at various periods in her life. Thus the book reflects moods atmospheres and seasons. After discovering this gem I felt perhaps I should stop while I was feeling that I was ahead. I saved this draft. Hence I made a coffee and thought about how I could maybe get my hands on a copy of the Sandra Bellame book. Sipped coffee and thought that perhaps I should get on with preparing the FP&IE daily. I checked out Daily Kos. Pretty sure there was supposed to be something on schedule on saturday at Readers and Book Lovers that I probably missed. Looked in nothing there I probably got days mixed up. This  seems like fun. I will covet this new activity. It is not often book reviews appear. Usually once a week or a month. I will hoard  this newfound joy. Maybe even visit different regions another day when I feel I need a little element of treasure hunt chasing the left end of a rainbow. Now I was very interested in reading Escape from Pretoria. I checked around to find more details. I dicsovered that Tim jenkin had made the book available for public in pdf format as a part of South Africa History Project. The book is available to download and read at → South Africa History Online Direct link to the book for download in pdf (199 pages) → Tim Jenkin: Escape From Pretoria  If you’re not already following Foreign Policy and International Events (FP&IE) please go to our homepage (link) find the Follow Group button in the left margin and click it to FOLLOW GROUP.
