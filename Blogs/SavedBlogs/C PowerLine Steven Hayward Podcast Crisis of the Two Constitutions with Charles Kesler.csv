C, Podcast: Crisis of the Two Constitutions with Charles Kesler, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-24, This week’s Power Line Classic format show features me in conversation with Prof. Charles R. Kesler editor of the Claremont Review of Books talking about his brand new book Crisis of the Two Constitutions: The Rise Decline and Recovery of American Greatness. Crisis collects several of Kesler’s old and new essays and details how we got to and what is at stake in our increasingly divided America. In addition to explaining the three waves of liberal-progressive thought over the last century Kesler also covers the significance of Trump’s emergence and what it portends for the future. He also responds to the attack Boston College Professor Shep Melnick made on the book so there’s an element of Fight Club in this episode too. The crisis of two podcast outlets presents a dilemma for listeners—you can listen here or download it from our hosts at Ricochet. And a reminder: there won’t be a Three Whisky Happy Hour format episode this week: Lucretia is traveling and I was supposed to be on the road too but had to change my plans. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
