L, 2021-04-25 GNR favorites this week (Plus), AlpineBob, 2021-04-25,  A total of 330000 candles were arranged in the shape of Earth to set a Guinness World Record during #EarthDay at Thailand's Dhammakaya temple pic.twitter.com/ppJS5R3UDJ One of the things I like best about this world is dancing!  And here is something different — I found this short animated movie browsing YouTube that really resonated with me.  Warning — It is quite bleak through most but I promise it ends on a note of hope.

Feeding a bear while her cub hugs your leg makes you a badass.(photo from 1950's Chukchi Peninsula; thanks to Cara Sikkema Facebook) pic.twitter.com/kxdbLzrVKM Here is something else unusual…   Designed to replace one of the most un-recycled materials on the planet the wrap consists of natural ingredients that are safe for the environment and humans. The research which was published in the Journal of Food Engineering describes three types of food films based on the well-known naturally occurring seaweed biopolymer sodium alginate—a compound found within the cell walls of brown algae. “Its molecules have film-forming properties” said Rammohan Aluru senior researcher at the organic synthesis laboratory at Ural Federal University and co-author of the paper. “The greatest advantage of sodium alginate is that it performs as liquid-gel in an aqueous medium.” Sounds Tasty!Actually there are other edible food wraps already I believe.  The real issue for me is if you eat the wrap it is much the same thing as not having a wrap at all — you get to eat anything the wrap may have touched.  Still it should biodegrade well unlike plastic so it could be mulched instead of landfilled.  More cool science: A Swedish engineer has created a suit that helps people with Parkinson's disease and stroke get rid of tremors using electrical stimulation.pic.twitter.com/XLEg3iwhy3 There was a early morning Dragon launch this week that was really nice but I figure everyone who cares has already seen it  But if you are curious here is the 12 minutes compressed into a 10 second timelapse.  Also here’s this: "Ingenuity has performed its first flight — the first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet!"The data reveals: Our #MarsHelicopter has had a successful first flight: 🚁 pic.twitter.com/h5a6aGGgHG Yeah I know everybody has already seen this too but it was one of my favorite things this week! :)  Also yesterday was the 31st anniversary of the Hubble!Linked HERE is a pic taken by Hubble. (Apparently I shouldn’t imbed the pic due to copyright issues...) It is today’s Astronomy Pic of the Day.  50 Very Bad Book Covers for #Literary Classics. This is hilarious. The commentary is as good as the covers are bad ("I hate it and want to burn it in a fire").#literature #books #art #photography #writers https://t.co/7J0A9lO7Uo via @lithub  I’ll finish here with one of my favorite songs:
