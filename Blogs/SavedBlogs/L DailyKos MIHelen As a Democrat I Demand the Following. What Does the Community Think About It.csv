L, As a Democrat I Demand the Following. What Does the Community Think About It?, MIHelen, 2021-04-23, Will cut the intro short and keep the demands straight: Equal pay for equal job regardless of gender race or ethnicity and equal economic opportunity – Inequality at work is one of the most common crises of today’s world. There should not be any discrimination while payment of wage. Females get a different treatment at workplace and are usually paid less than males by their employers the gender pay gap is still very steady in the US. After gender inequality the one thing that needs our focus is racism at workplace according to some reports black and Hispanic women face a lot of discrimination at work as they do not get equal pay for equal work compared to White and Asian/Pacific women. Employment discrimination includes hiring firing transfer or promotion based on sexual orientation physical and mental disability race or ethnicity. People of LGBTQ community do not get equal job opportunities and are often left jobless despite of being talented and highly qualified. It is every person’s right to get equal pay for equal job and equal employment opportunities irrespective of their gender ethnicity or race and the discrimination at work must stop. Affordable and quality healthcare and education – Healthcare and education should be made affordable to all Americans. Rising costs of healthcare and education are a cause of worry for many low-income American families every child in America should have access to quality education in affordable cost. It is also especially important to standardize education and healthcare. LGBT Rights and Right to Privacy – As a democrat I support LGBTQ rights same gender marriage and Right to Privacy. Hate crime against LGBT community must stop and anyone who indulge in hate crime must get a hard punishment. Discrimination and harassment of LGBT community at workplace is also a common sight and it must stop. Everyone is equal in America and should be treated the same way.   Expansion of social security – Improve benefit for individuals and Increase in monthly benefit of social security and protect older individuals against having to exhaust their savings. Ban conversion therapy – Homophobia is for real and some homophobes try to change an individual’s sexual orientation from bisexual or homosexual to heterosexual by physical psychological or spiritual interventions. This should be strictly prohibited. As a democrat I feel the above-mentioned things would help America and its citizens in growing socially and economically. I would love to know your opinion on this.
