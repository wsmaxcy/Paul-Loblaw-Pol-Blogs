L, Toxic transphobia is alive and well on DailyKos (Updated), CyberMindGrrl, 2021-05-04, You know what I’m so fucking sick and tired of every transgender story being invaded by toxic transphobic assholes these days. DailyKos USED to be a safe space for us but obviously not any longer. Yes I know most of you are allies but enough is enough already. We get it some of you don’t believe that transgender girls should play in sports and would rather they sit on the sidelines or play on the boys’ team because in your mind they’re nothing but 7 foot tall Shaquille O’Neals with boobs and lipstick (an actual comment made by a user that’s been here since 2016). For the love of God EDUCATE yourself before blasting this place with your bigotry and ignorance. Trans women are allowed to compete in the Olympics so why the FUCK do you think that high school or college sports should be any different? Why the FUCK do you think men are transitioning to women just so they can gain an unfair advantage? Are you so sick in the fucking head that you actually believe this is a thing? That this is a serious problem worthy of passing new laws banning trans girls from competing with other girls?  Before the Republican Party made this into a problem IT WASN’T A FUCKING PROBLEM. THEY created this issue literally out of thin air as a distraction for their failed policies and YOU fell for it. Congratulations you are now carrying their water.  I’m sick of it and seriously considering that my time with DailyKos is over. I consider many of you to be friends and allies but I’m sick of these toxic voices being elevated over everyone else’s. To even THINK that making such a comment is funny witty or even REMOTELY worth making out loud proves that transphobia is alive and well even in liberal safe spaces. “Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt” -Abraham Lincoln Enough is enough already.  Update 4:47PM — holy crap I just stepped away to run some errands and this diary blew TF up! All I can say to EVERY ONE of you is THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! Thank you ALL for the love and support you are sending my way and I want you to know that I won’t be going anywhere soon. You all arebwhat make DK one of the most amazing online communities on the interwebz and one of the best places to learn and grow.   Thank you all! 🥰
