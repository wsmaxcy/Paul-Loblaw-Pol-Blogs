L, New Revelations About Mikayla, Nancy Groutsis, 2021-05-09, I seek the truth regardless of who’s saying it. Therefore I read news from many sources and try to sift out the truth. I recently read a blog by Aidan Kearney who says “we are constantly getting censored and banned by Facebook for what are clearly not violations of their terms of service.” Yet I think I should at least consider the things he says even though he’s obviously prejudiced against BLM. He says the police found Mikayla “with one end of a belt tied to a small tree for leverage with other around her neck. To kill yourself in this manner you lean forward and choke yourself to death. I know what this feels like because I tried the same thing with an extension chord 3 months ago.” It is possible to kill oneself this way: “Manual self-strangulation cannot cause death due to hypoxia or lack of oxygen because the victim passes out and releases the pressure before hypoxic death occurs. However according to a story aired by NPR in 2012 around 82 teenagers are known to have accidentally died from self-strangulation while playing the so-called "choking game" over a 12-year period. All of these deaths involved applying a ligature such as a belt scarf or rope presumably didn't release as intended after the victim became unconscious.”  Though it’s possible to kill oneself this way I believe Mikayla was murdered. However as I said before I’m not stating that as a fact. It’s an opinion I formed from reading a lot about this story. The purpose of this article is to reveal contradictory information than what Calvina Strothers stated about Mikayla not being a “troubled child.” Kearney said Mikayla suffered mentally when her girlfriend started dating another girl. This new relationship ended Mikayla’s romantic relationship with Katelyn and distraught she sought xanax mushrooms pot and alcohol to lessen her pain. Kearney provides social media evidence of this-statements by Mikayla. He also says Strothers beat Mikayla: “In March of 2020 there was an incident at Mikayla’s home which Kaitlyn witnessed. Calvina allegedly assaulted her daughter...and the police were called...For roughly two weeks Mikayla stayed in foster care in Quincy before being reunited with her mother.” Nevertheless Strothers did buy Mikayla a new car-even before she learned how to drive-and she genuinely seemed heartbroken talking about the death of her daughter; so I do believe mother and daughter had a loving relationship. A lot of people are unhappy that I don’t stay on one side-no matter what. But that’s how I am because the only side to be on is the side of truth. That’s why I listen to everyone regardless of their virtue creed gender race personality popularity etc. And I listened for words about the fitness app police claimed recorded Mikayla walking 1316 steps yet Apple said the app was off according to Strothers and Kearney didn't mention it. We’re going to find out more as the detectives from Mikayla’s family and the police eventually present their facts. A lot of people have mental problems but they don’t kill themselves; so these revelations don’t prove anything. Katelyn admitted she beat up Mikayla and soon after Mikayla was found dead so there are contradictions about who really cared for Mikayla and we deserve the truth.
