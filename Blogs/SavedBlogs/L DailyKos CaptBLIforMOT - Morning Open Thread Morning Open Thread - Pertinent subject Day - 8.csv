L, Morning Open Thread - Pertinent subject Day - 8, CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-05-02, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve been given the task of hosting the Sunday edition of the MOT time.  I am not sure what we will discover today.  Let’s see what we can explore. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. Today’s subject can only grow on 29% of the Earth’s surface.  This makes a STICK a rare commodity.  This item is considered one of the most treasured possessions throughout history.  Here are some ways sticks have changed the world.  . A stick can come in sizes from a twig to a limb.  One of the most important uses for a stick was in the development of writing.  Cuneiform text was created by pressing a stick (to form certain shapes) in precise patterns into soft clay.  .  .  .  . Before humans created language and used sticks to form letters  sticks held to ability to illuminate the night.  No more fear of things that go bump in the dark. .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Put a few sticks together add fire and you have the pillars of civilization.  Homes were built around a hearth where many a meal was shared. .  .  .  .  A way to enjoy a meal is with chopsticks.  After you may want to use a tooth pick.  .  .  . In conclusion if you are up the creek without a paddle or on the top rung of the ladder sticks are in your life every day.  Play well with others and don’t run with sharp things in the house. Here’s a little music to keep us content.    Thank you.
