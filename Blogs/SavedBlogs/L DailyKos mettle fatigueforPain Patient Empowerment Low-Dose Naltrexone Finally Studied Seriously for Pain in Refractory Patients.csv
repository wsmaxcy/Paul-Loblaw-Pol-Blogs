L, Low-Dose Naltrexone Finally Studied Seriously for Pain in 'Refractory Patients', mettle fatigueforPain Patient Empowerment, 2021-05-05,  “...we're seeing that at low doses[1] ["Naltrexone[1]] has a paradoxical[2] effect where it exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and it may be beneficial for patients with fibromyalgia[1] or low-back pain" study investigator Kaivalya Deshpande MD a resident at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) told Medscape Medical News… ...because the dose of naltrexone used to treat pain is so low at just one tenth of the actual dose used in addiction the potential for addiction is low he noted. "...thus far there hasn't been any documented abuse potential with low-dose naltrexone" ...The findings were presented at the virtual American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) 2021 Annual Meeting. Refractory Patients The investigators wanted to understand the effects of low-dose naltrexone as an adjunctive treatment in their chronic pain patients many of whom are refractory to first-line treatments.      The study involved a retrospective chart review of 65 UPMC chronic pain clinic patients with either low-back radiculopathy or fibromyalgia. All had experienced pain for more than 3 months and had  failed traditional treatment strategies including physical therapy anti-inflammatory and neuropathic pain medications and epidural steroid injections.      (Editorial note: conventional medical wording is demonstrated here conflating refractory pain with refractory patient and saying the patient “failed” treatment when more accurately it was treatment failing the patient. In seeking to streamline phrasing the meanings contort. Often in a manner suggesting blaming the patient. In some viewpoints more often with female patients than with male.) Patients received low-dose naltrexone for a minimum period of 1 month and were followed longitudinally. Outcome measures included pain scores percent improvement in disability the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI)[1] the Pain Catastrophizing Scale[13] and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) metrics…. ...results showed that with appropriate patient selection "LDN could be an additional [pain] treatment option..." In the United States naloxone is available without a prescription in every state with the exception of Hawaii.[86][87]    ...It is generally assumed that the tendency to catastrophize plays a causal role in the pain experience – that is it causes the person to experience the pain as more intense … through ... heightening emotional responses to pain.[2] However we cannot yet rule out the possibility that at least some aspects of catastrophization may actually be the product of an intense pain experience [and the devastation of life it has caused the patient] rather than its cause.   Ya think? “Professionals are trained  to consider patient feedback the “lowest form of evidence on [the evidence hierarchy] even [below] research on mice”  with the common result where pain (or other “subjective” symptoms/impacts) are concerned that if patients report severe effects and about a drug that helps with it or that they’ve read helps they risk being considered drug-seekers even addicts potentially with serious consequences for their healthcare.      This research may help change condemnation of patients with lives devastated by diseases and syndromes whose symptomology includes severe pain for which only poor or additionally damaging treatments may have been available. In addition to the two disorders specified in the article are also perhaps Lyme Disease additional forms of arthritis and many others.     All links in this diary are free.
