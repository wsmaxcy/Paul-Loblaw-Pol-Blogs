L, Gender affirming care as 'life saving' care, ecowyoming, 2021-04-26, Despite several stories on the topic here I haven’t seen anyone else reference this very interesting story on Science Friday that aired on 4/23/2021.   It educated me and was well worth the time to listen.  What these health professionals and their patients and families were conveying is that “Gender-Affirming Healthcare Is ‘Lifesaving Care’”.   State legislatures around the country are proposing bills to remove access to gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth. Meanwhile doctors parents and trans adults warn that restricting access to commonplace interventions like puberty blocking medications will endanger the mental health and social well-being of trans children across the country.  The American Academy of Pediatrics the American Medical Association the Pediatric Endocrine Society have all condemned bills like Arkansas’ AB1570 which passed the state legislature in early April. It prohibits healthcare providers from giving puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones to anyone under the age of 18. The World Professional Organization For Transgender Healthcare (WPATH) which produces standards of care for transgender youth and adults has stated that the ability to pause puberty supports the mental health of trans youth while they navigate their gender identities. Ira talks to pediatric endocrinologist Kara Connelly and family therapist Alex Iantaffi about their work with trans youth and what gender-affirming health care provides to young people and throughout a person’s lifespan.  It didn’t sound like anything being forced on kids and it’s helping them live. Since puberty doesn’t happen in one day it seems from this article and the guests on the show that the puberty blockers are not equal to chemical castration as asserted by an author here on DKos.   A pause on puberty can give a child and parents time to sort things out medically and financially and save a lot of pain and expensive surgery later.   Unfortunately there isn’t a transcript yet of the whole show but I urge people to check out the SciFri website. And here is an article specifically about puberty blockers www.ohsu.edu/… Alex a commenter to the show had this to say ...It’s allowed me to feel so much more comfortable in my skin and confident and less anxious in my day to day. But it goes so much more than that. I really feel like it’s given me my life. Like that my life has now started. And I don’t really know how else to describe it. But it’s a wonderful gift. And I’ve been very lucky that I’ve had access to good gender-affirming health care here in the Bay Area. I’m very privileged. I have health care. And I have a supportive partner in a safe home. And not all trans people have those things. But the only really regret I have is that I couldn’t access gender affirming care earlier as a teenager. Because to me it’s like looking back on those years that I could have started living my life earlier. And to think about those teenagers who you know might be getting cut off from services that they don’t get that chance then that they have to wait… it’s unbearable to think about. How much suffering that is creating. And what we really need is we need people and young people to thrive and grow and be able to be themselves…. Once again the right wing is using scare tactics disguised as concern for the children and we have to have our spidey senses alerted to the misinformation. This radio story referenced here was in response to the anti-trans youth bills that are being pushed by Republican legislatures.   ACLU has a page listing all these bills and their status. www.aclu.org/...
