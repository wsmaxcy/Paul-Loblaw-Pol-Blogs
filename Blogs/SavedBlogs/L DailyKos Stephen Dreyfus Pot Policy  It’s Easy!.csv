L, Pot Policy?  It’s Easy!, Stephen Dreyfus, 2021-05-09, I was driving to Charlotte yesterday when I heard the Freakonomics radio broadcast “Let’s Be Blunt: Marijuana Is a Boon for Older Workers.” I found the researcher’s work fascinating.  In states where pot was legal workman compensation costs were significantly reduced.  This is the kind of radio broadcast I love to listen to—until the researcher repeated a comment I found infuriating. In the words of Katherine McClain of Temple University: “No policy decision is easy.  You have to think about both the costs and the benefits.  What we have to think about is what is best for society.” Later the commentator concludes “I have to say I love episodes like this one.  Katherine McClain does a great job reminding all of us that getting the right data can be hard that policy making is even harder…” No the policy is not hard.  It’s easy! By and large both the commentator and the researcher presented argument after argument as to why marijuana is both good for the economy and good for one’s health. It has been a financial boon for the states where it has become legal.  Yet less they be accused of one-sider-ism they both made a big deal about high school students that smoked pot didn’t earn as much money later in life compared to high-school students who didn’t smoke pot.  Anyone with any experience knows you can’t study if drunk or stoned.  And any high school student who skips classes to get stoned isn’t going to fare well later in life regardless of the reasons someone decides to drop out and do something less taxing than learn. As a Psychologist and Addictions Counselor I have studied the War on Drugs including marijuana for fifty years.  Yes we need valid research on the economic and health effects of marijuana.  But what is the point of amassing more and more information today in order to determine if it is really a good idea to legalize marijuana when there was overwhelming evidence marijuana should have been legal fifty years ago?  Moreover marijuana never should have been made illegal in the first place. In Steve DeAngelo’s book The Cannabis Manifesto he quotes a 2011 Global Commission on Drug Policy which stated “Political leaders and public figures [lack] the courage to articulate publicly what many…acknowledge privately.” I was disappointed with what Joe Biden said about the War on Drugs when I heard him live at a rally in Greenville SC.  He said he wanted to force illegal drug-offenders into treatment. This might sound good but coerced treatment doesn’t work—and it is so much simpler to eliminate illegal drug use by making the drugs legal.   I had better luck speaking personally to Kamala Harris when she was in Greenville.  She told me face-to-face she supported legalizing marijuana.   Yet compared to what I heard South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster say about legalizing medical marijuana Biden’s approach is far more progressive.  McMaster ignorantly claimed marijuana has no medical benefits. So let me be blunt:  Legalizing marijuana is not now nor never has been a difficult policy decision—providing you use science and common sense as your guide. This past Tuesday a good friend of mine reminded me her daughter is still serving time in prison in Texas for a marijuana offense.  Marijuana prohibition is harmful—too harmful to justify making marijuana illegal for any reason. Yet the speakers on the NPR podcast possessed an unspoken assumption that simply isn’t true.  They assumed marijuana should be legal because the benefits outweigh the harm.  They pointed out alcohol was more harmful than cannabis. Marijuana should be legal regardless of whether the benefits outweigh the harm.  The American adult citizen not a politician in the name of the government nor even a research scientist in the name of society should have the final say as to whether he should use marijuana or not.  Legalization does not mean nor should it mean the government endorses any particular behavior.  The only behaviors the government should prohibit are those behaviors which endanger other people. Government should insist people wear masks and get Covid vaccines because not doing so endangers other people.  However the government has no right to tell me I must get a vaccine for pneumonia as pneumonia isn’t contagious; nor that I should not be legally allowed to eat red meat even if it harms me. Government should insist people not drive while drunk on alcohol because driving while highly intoxicated harms other people.  Yet the government has no right to insist I have to wear a seat-belt which only protects me and doesn’t harm anyone else.  (I wear one anyway.  I am not stupid.) Government should be allowed to ban assault rifles and other guns which are weapons of mass destruction because such weapons harm other people.  Yet government should not ban gambling or prostitution simply because other people believe it is harmful to society.  These are victimless crimes between consenting adults that do not directly harm or endanger anyone else.  (One might argue that prostitution harms the wife of a man seeking a prostitute and she should have legal protection but that is a family matter.) Likewise government should have no right to prohibit any adult citizen from consuming any drug either for medicinal or recreational purposes.  Neither should the government prohibit a woman from having an abortion.  Each individual should have the right to control their own mind and body.  IMHO this right is so fundamental the founding fathers didn’t even think it was necessary to put in into the Bill of Rights. A simple aphorism:  Your right to swing your fist ends where it reaches my nose. There will be those who cannot resist arguing that only “safe” drugs like marijuana should be legalized but other “unsafe” drugs like cocaine or opiates should be illegal.  They are missing the point.  First of all the more dangerous a drug is the more imperative it is that it remain legal.  Making drugs illegal increases the risk of death drug related problems and addiction.  Keeping and making drugs legal minimizes the risks and dangers of drugs.  Even so the burden of responsibility should be on the individual not the government of society. Making an informed decision on marijuana policy isn’t advanced calculus.  It’s easy!  Marijuana should be legal.  If you still think differently you are a McMoron.
