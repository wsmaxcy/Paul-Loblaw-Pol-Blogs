L, Finally: NY Congressman Introduces National 'Right To Repair' Bill, Susie Madrak, 2021-06-18, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Here's some hopeful news for consumers: The right-to-repair movement has made it to Congress. Yesterday Rep. Joseph Morelle of New York filed legislation that would make it easier for consumers to fix their own broken gadgets without being locked into paying manufacturers. Via Gizmodo: If passed the Fair Repair Act would require manufacturers to give device owners and third-party repair shops access to replacement parts diagnostic information and tools needed to repair their electronics. To date most right-to-repair legislation has been introduced at the state level but this bill would establish a nationwide standard. “For too long large corporations have hindered the progress of small business owners and everyday Americans by preventing them from the right to repair their own equipment” Morelle said in a statement Thursday. “It’s long past time to level the playing field... and put the power back in the hands of consumers. This common-sense legislation will help make technology repairs more accessible and affordable for items from cell phones to laptops to farm equipment finally giving individuals the autonomy they deserve.” Under Morelle’s bill the Federal Trade Commission would be allowed to penalize companies found in violation of the legislation. Penalties could include forcing manufacturers to pay damages or give refunds to customers. How does the corporate repair monopoly work? For instance a farmer owns a John Deere tractor: In many cases no we don't. https://t.co/LiInup6HIu — AI6YR (@ai6yrham) June 18 2021 Look like "right to fix" legislation was just introduced under The Fair Repair act - super good news. Was reading recently about the absolute hell that some farmers go through with John Deere to repair farming equipment. https://t.co/4hlRDxNlpQhttps://t.co/mNahI42UtM — jdelta (@jdelta11) June 17 2021 And of course we're not supposed to fix our own cars anymore: There was a right-to-repair law (for cars) on the ballot in MA last year that passed 75-25. https://t.co/Hm7PSZXQhg — Andrew Flax (@ajflax) June 18 2021 Right to repair affects more than you think: A new feature by @a_greenberg for @wired on the bizarre fight over diagnostic/control tools for McDonald's soft-serve machines is a fantastic fascinating look at the intersection of #RightToRepair with hardware hacking corporatism and franchising.https://t.co/Iq7hoCE01N1/ pic.twitter.com/8KeQ6PjwMe — Cory Doctorow AWAY UNTIL JUNE 19 (@doctorow) April 20 2021 a tasty “good vs. evil” right to repair story brought to you by ambitious security researchers - and @McDonalds #Engineering #cybersecurity #IoT #RightToRepair https://t.co/QKRdosJwjv — David Scott (@wicked_security) May 26 2021 This is just one industry lobbying front against right-to-repair but its names are a who’s-who of auto manufacturers: GM Ford Chrysler (FCA) Kia Hyundai Subaru VW/Audi Mazda BMW Daimler Mitsubishi Jaguar Land Rover Volvo.https://t.co/moNtuQoGXz — Rob McMillin (@scareduck) June 18 2021 Not everyone's good at it of course. But a lot of people are: For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
