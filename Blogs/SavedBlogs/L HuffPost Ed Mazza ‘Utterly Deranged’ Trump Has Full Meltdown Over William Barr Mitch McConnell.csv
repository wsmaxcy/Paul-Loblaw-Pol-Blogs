L, ‘Utterly Deranged’ Trump Has Full Meltdown Over William Barr Mitch McConnell, Ed Mazza, 2021-06-28, Donald Trump issued a lengthy and rambling statement late Sunday attacking two of his staunchest allies during his one term as president. Trump called former Attorney General William Barr and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell “spineless RINOs” (Republicans in name only) after Barr told The Atlantic that Trump’s constant claims of election fraud were “bullshit.” Barr also told the magazine that McConnell urged him to “inject some reality” into Trump as he repeated debunked claims of election fraud and baseless conspiracy theories last winter.  McConnell confirmed that account the magazine reported. That was enough to trigger the former president.  Trump who once claimed he would hire only “the best and most serious people” called Barr a “disappointment in every sense of the word” much as he has attacked many of the other “best people” he hired including Jeff Sessions (attorney general) Rex Tillerson (secretary of state) James Mattis (defense secretary) John Bolton (national security adviser) H.R. McMaster (national security adviser) John Kelly (homeland security secretary and White House chief of staff) and Mike Pence (vice president).  Critics on Twitter slammed Trump for the disjointed new statement attacking two of his enablers: Holy moly. Our utterly deranged most recent Former President just released an absolutely crazed delusional lie filled rambling lengthy attack on William Barr for telling the simple truth about Trump’s insane election fraud lies.
