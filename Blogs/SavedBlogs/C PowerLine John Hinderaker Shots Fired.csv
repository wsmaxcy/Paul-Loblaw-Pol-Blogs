C, Shots Fired, John Hinderaker, 2021-05-25, This morning there was a street festival at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis a place generally avoided by the police. The Associated Press anticipated the event: The intersection where George Floyd took his final breaths is to be transformed Tuesday into an outdoor festival on the anniversary of his death with food children’s activities and a long list of musical performers. But the festivities were rudely interrupted: Quick rough footage of the moment we heard shots fired at George Floyd Square. We counted 30 upon looking back at the footage. pic.twitter.com/oxGkLQru9Q — Philip Crowther (@PhilipinDC) May 25 2021

The woman in the studio is stunned as her reporter disappears from the screen but she soldiers on with more talk about police reform: This is dystopian A reporter comes under fire at the George Floyd memorial and the @KARE11 anchor cuts away to talk about police reform pic.twitter.com/Sywj8e1gud — Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) May 25 2021   Yes give us some more of that “police reform.” Because it’s working so well! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
