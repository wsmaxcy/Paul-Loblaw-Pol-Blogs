L, Four Days After Independence Day Texas GOP Meets to Pass Voter Suppression Law, stevescoop, 2021-07-03, I was first introduced to Carroll G. Robinson when I started writing articles about Democracy Counts a national nonprofit organization that advocates for transparent and accurate elections.  Robinson serves on the board of Democracy Counts.  Eventually though I learned more about him which is why I am proud to share his July 4 essay encouraging Texas Democrats to fight the Republican effort to pass a voter suppression bill when a Special Legislative Session commences on July 8.  This is what Robinson wants to share with concerned patriots. Tomorrow we celebrate another Fourth of July. The fight for freedom in our nation however did not end at Lexington and Concord nor did it end at Shiloh or Gettysburg. Slavery Lynchings Water Hoses Attack Dogs Beatings Bombings and Murders was the price that Black America had to pay for civil rights and the right to vote.  Now Republicans in Texas and across our nation want to once again take us back to the old days of counting the number of bubbles in a bar of soap the number of beans in a jar and having to pay poll taxes to vote. Just a few days ago the United States Supreme Court made it even harder to fight voter suppression by Republican state legislators. A few weeks earlier Texas State House Democrats became the first Democrats in our nation to defeat a Republican voter suppression bill by walking out of the legislature and breaking the House quorum. Governor Abbott has now called a special legislative session that will begin on July 8th to once again try and pass the Republican voter suppression bill.  Some Democrats are now saying that it is too much of a burden for State House Democrats to leave the state and not go back to Austin to keep Republicans from passing their voter suppression bill. Some Democrats are also saying “ Why fight because it is inevitable that Republicans will eventually pass their voter suppression bill before the general election in November 2022.” It’s hard for me to understand or accept that kind of defeatist attitude. To win Democrats have to try. We have to stand united and fight back for as long as it takes. Freedom ain’t free and has always required sacrifice. If all Texas Democrats are no longer willing to sacrifice and fight together for the right to vote what else really matters? Leaving Texas does not require the same kind of sacrifice that was made by those who marched in the 1960s or sat at lunch counters or made Freedom Rides for civil rights and voting rights. This Is Now Our Fight for Freedom. State House Democrats must not go back to Austin on July 8th. They need to leave the state for as long as it takes to defeat the Republican voter suppression bill. I am confident that Democrats in Texas and across America will donate to help State House Democrats and their staff with the finances they need to make this fight for as long as it takes. The Texas Democratic Party needs to start raising money now for this fight. Labor and the DNC must help supplement unemployment benefits for the state employees Governor Abbott has illegally fired. If Democrats are unwilling to make this fight to defeat voter suppression in Texas we are unlikely to hold on to our majority in Congress or win back the State House in Texas in 2022. If we don’t continue to fight for Black Hispanic young and low-income voters how can we expect them to stand up and vote for us? This is now our 1776 and time for our Democratic Declaration of Emancipation. This is our modern fight for freedom.  Let’s make the fight and win. Leave Texas or leave office so that we can break the quorum and break the back of the Republican’s push for voter suppression here in Texas. As we celebrate the Fourth let’s continue the historic fight for freedom. God Bless Texas and America. Carroll G. Robinson is Chairman of the Texas Coalition of Black Democrats.
