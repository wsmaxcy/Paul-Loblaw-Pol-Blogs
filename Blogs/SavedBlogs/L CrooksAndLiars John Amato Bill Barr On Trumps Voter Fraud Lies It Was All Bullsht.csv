L, Bill Barr On Trump's Voter Fraud Lies: 'It Was All Bullsh*t', John Amato, 2021-06-27, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  In a series of interviews with Jonathan Karl that appeared in The Atlantic it was revealed that Attorney General Bill Barr considered Trump's election fraud claims to be "bullshit" all along.  After almost a month of conspiracies fueled by Trump and his dutiful soldier of lies Rudy Giuliani on December 1 Bill Barr finally broke his silence and told the Associated Press's Michael Balsamo what was what. Barr said “To date we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.” When the story hit the wires it blew up the seditious ex-president's voter fraud conspiracy theories. It was clear since his former AG had the DOJ look into the many conspiracies put out there.  Karl also learned that Sen. Mitch McConnell was worried that Trump's bogus claims if not reined in would hurt their chances at retaking both Senate seats in Georgia. “Bill I look around and you are the only person who can do it” McConnell told him. After it appeared Barr was going to destroy the DOJ to aid Trump's lies and try to steal the election he told Karl this: "My attitude was: It was put-up or shut-up time” said Barr. “If there was evidence of fraud I had no motive to suppress it. But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.” As you can imagine Trump was livid and when he finally spoke to Barr it felt like a scene from Dr. Strangelove.  Trump brought up Barr’s AP interview. “Did you say that?” “Yes” Barr responded. “How the fuck could you do this to me? Why did you say it?” “Because it’s true.” The president livid responded by referring to himself in the third person: “You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump.” Many people are criticizing Barr for having waited so long to reveal the truth about the lying f**k that was in the White House and I agree.  An attorney general is supposed to uphold the Constitution not kowtow to a megalomaniacal narcissistic fascist. That's why we have a Constitution to begin with. You really see that bill barr and mitch McConnell were too cowardly to stand up to trump because they were cowards and also wanted to win in Georgia. Democracy dies because “we need trump to win Georgia.” — Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) June 27 2021 Barr might have even been able to quell the insurrection before it began although with these QAnon and anti-government seditious freaks I doubt it. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
