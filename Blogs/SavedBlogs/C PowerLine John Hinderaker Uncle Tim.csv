C, Uncle Tim?, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-29, Historically giving the out-party’s response to a president’s speech to a joint session of Congress has been a thankless task. That is in part because the out-party’s response typically delivered to a camera in a more or less empty room looks lame compared to the excitement in the House chamber.  Last night may have been different however. Joe Biden’s snoozefest generated no excitement in the near-empty House and Senator Tim Scott delivering the GOP’s response hit back on the central point the Democrats want to press: Scott denied Biden’s claim that America is a “systemically racist” society. Truth. https://t.co/CmM4NAqHsv — Brit Hume (@brithume) April 29 2021  
The result was nuclear. Liberals rushed to denounce Senator Scott and “#UncleTim” a favorite epithet trended on Twitter. Stephen Miller collected a number of offensive liberal tweets along with this: And the media blue checks all suddenly looking away right at the same time. Weird. https://t.co/g74Om7aKho — Stephen L.

Tim Scott’s star has been rising for a while and last night’s contribution will continue that trend. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
