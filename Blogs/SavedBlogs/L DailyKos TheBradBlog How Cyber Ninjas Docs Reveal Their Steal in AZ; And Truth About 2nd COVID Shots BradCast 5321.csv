L, How Cyber Ninjas' Docs Reveal Their Steal in AZ; And Truth About 2nd COVID Shots: 'BradCast' 5/3/21, TheBradBlog, 2021-05-03, After getting our second COVID vaccine shots on Friday we return for today's BradCast. For Desi it was mostly a breeze. For me just a few hours after taking the photo at right as discussed on today's show it was a bit of a nightmare (if a worthwhile one) -- as explained today along with some special election news out of Texas and some disturbing exclusive information out of the 2020 election "audit" theater being carried out by Trump supporters in Maricopa County (Phoenix) Arizona. [Audio link to full show follows below.] First up news out of the Saturday special election in Texas' 6th Congressional District for a U.S. House seat left vacant by Republican Congressman Ron Wright who died from COVID last December. His widow Susan Wright was the top vote-getter in the 23-person all-parties race. And another Republican GOP fundraiser and state Rep. Jake Ellzey reportedly came in second narrowly edging out Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez by less than half a percentage point. Sanchez conceded on Sunday in the contest where most votes were cast at polling places on 100 percent unverifiable touchscreens and none of the candidates came close to the 50 percent mark that they'd need to beat to avoid an upcoming runoff election for the seat.  Dems hopes of expanding their narrow majority in the U.S. House were dashed with the loss in the mostly rural reliably Republican district south of Dallas. While there were no challenges to the unverifiable results in Texas with two Republicans winning Trump supporters in Arizona continue their tax-payer funded [PDF] but privately-run "audit" of 2.1 million hand-marked paper ballots in Maricopa County as we discussed last week in detail on the show with two experienced election auditors who had rare access inside the secret counting at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum while media were locked out. Late last week in response to a state judge's order the Florida tech firm -- a group named Cyber Ninjas with no experience in either elections or voting systems who were retained by the GOP-majority state Senate to carry out this unprecedented "audit" -- revealed a 191-page document [PDF] supposedly detailing their recount and forensic audit procedures. (Though in fact as we also report these procedures have been changed many times since the "audit" began over a week ago.) Many questions such as why they are running ballots through a UV light are not answered by the documents which the far-right group whose leader has claimed last year's Presidential election was stolen (without offering actual evidence to support the claim) attempted to keep concealed as "trade secrets". Other information was revealed however such as the group's process for tallying ballots which as I explain today would actually allow the group to add (yes steal) a minimum of 42000 votes for Trump without ever raising any alarms or red flags in the group's internal procedures. That in race that was decided statewide for Joe Biden by just over 10000 votes. Worse because the Ninjas are keeping all of their daily counts and tally sheets secret from the public there will be no way to know at the end of the process (if they even finish before they must leave their rented venue on May 14) how they actually derived their numbers or if they in any way match up with what the paid counters actually tallied. In short we support any citizens being allowed to examine ballots to determine if elections are accurately tabulated -- even extreme partisans. But their are rules that need to be minded to assure integrity of that process as well. The process currently under way in AZ is a joke. It is election "audit" theater. That's because there is zero real oversight by the public in place. And the state GOP Senate has forced the County Board of Elections (4 Rs and 1 D who opposed this privatized tax-payer funded charade) to give up secure control of the actual ballots to the Ninjas who could now do anything they want to them. And while the documents are short on details on the group's actual tallying procedures they are long on concerns about how "Antifa" might use extreme violence to attack the venue with firebombs and chemical weapons. Seriously. That's who these people are and how they think. Finally it was a looong weekend for me after suffering from a couple of days of seemingly endless chills fever and pounding headaches after receiving my second Moderna shot on Friday. For Desi beyond a few mild aches and pains it was a breeze. Still it was in those horrible fever dream moments that I came to appreciate how important it was for everyone to get their shots anyway. I knew I was lucky enough that whatever I was going through would not in fact be "endless" as it has been for so many unfortunate people who contracted the actual virus. So I tell some truths about both what I went through (which media too often downplay) and why that made me happy -- not upset -- to have gone through it...and why you should too. Also today we share one of the great "parody" songs by the Marsh Family in Great Britain who have become a bit of a sensation during the pandemic in the UK.  Today's song is a beautiful moving yet amusing take off on Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah directed toward vaccine skeptics called Have the New Jab. I liken this adorable family to the Family Von Trapp of Sound of Music fame! And then we open up the phone lines to listeners who have recently had their 2nd jabs to hear how things went for them and if it was more like my experience or Desi's... * * * While we post The BradCast here every day and you can hear it across all of our great affiliate stations and websites to automagically get new episodes as soon as they're available sent right to your computer or personal device subscribe for free at iTunes Stitcher TuneIn or our native RSS feed!
