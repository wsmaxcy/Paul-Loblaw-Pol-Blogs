L, Why isn't the IRS collecting trillions owed in back due taxes?, Bad Reputation Good Trouble, 2021-05-04, According to The Young Turks there are approximately 1T$ in uncollected taxes annually due to the IRS being underfunded. Elizabeth Warren Trolls Crybaby Billionaire https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPUKtHf-x5w&ab_channel=TheYoungTurks Really? So why isn’t fixing the IRS a priority? It seems to me collecting money owed in order to have money for funding necessities is how individuals for profits & nonprofits manage to keep moving forward. I also seems like the working poor and middle class are paying up which means these two groups are subsidizing the wealthy who are not paying what is owed.  Systematic impoverishment of the working poor and middle class while the wealthy are further and unjustly enriched is no longer  acceptable or tenable. It's probably more complicated than that but if this is true then it really shouldn't be complicated at all. We need to stop feeding the fallacy that being a tax dodger is a smart rich people thing rather than the antisocial criminal act it truly is. If there is 4T$-5T$ in monies owed the US government then let's make collecting all taxes owed from everyone a priority.
