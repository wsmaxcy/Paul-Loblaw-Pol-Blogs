C, Minneapolis’s No-Go Zone, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-13, The Seattle “Autonomous Zone” got a lot of publicity before it was finally dismantled but many people do not realize that Minneapolis has its own no-go area where law enforcement is absent and “militants” rule. It is the area that surrounds the George Floyd Memorial. A man was shot and killed in the Memorial area last weekend the fourth such death since the zone was closed to law enforcement.  A reporter tried to get footage inside the no-go zone while standing outside a barricade but was driven away. Here is his report: The George Floyd memorial is an "autonomous zone" with several blocks controlled by activists. Police don't even go in. We tried to respectfully get video-but left after two people confronted us near the barricades.Later learned many protestors don't even feel comfortable there. pic.twitter.com/5w32fxQ0hR — Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) March 10 2021   Minneapolis was a great city when I moved there decades ago but now it is a sad shell of its former self dragged down by many years of misrule. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
