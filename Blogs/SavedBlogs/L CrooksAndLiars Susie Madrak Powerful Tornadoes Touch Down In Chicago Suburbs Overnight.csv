The National Weather Service announced last night that a "confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado" had touched down near Woodridge Illinois causing damage to several suburban communities. Via NBCChicago.com: According to trained weather spotters multiple reports of damage have come in from Woodridge with debris reported scattered across Interstate 355 and power lines and structures suffering heavy damage in the suburb. In nearby Naperville at least six people suffered minor injuries according to Fire Chief Mark Pucknaitis and at least a dozen homes suffered extensive damage Sunday night. NBC 5 reporters witnessed several large structures that had been damaged by the storm with officials in the community confirming that several areas were impassable due to tornado damage. It's never good to have to do these analyses this late at night but the tornado that hit Woodridge IL and nearby suburbs of Chicago was likely a strong EF3 based on an impressive 18000+ ft TDS and a 66 kt Vrot both remarkable for a QLCS tornado! #ilwx pic.twitter.com/ICdv3V15y4 — Sam Emmerson (@ou_sams) June 21 2021 #BREAKING: Major damage reported in the Chicago suburb of Woodridge following reports of a large and extremely dangerous tornado on the ground. pic.twitter.com/1VoRlghuWq — UA News (@UrgentAlertNews) June 21 2021 Breaking Weather: Confirmed major damage in the Woodridge IL area west side of Chicago with injuries. #ilwx #chicago #woodridge #tornado — Jeff Piotrowski (@Jeff_Piotrowski) June 21 2021 In the South Claudette has strengthened back into a tropical storm after cutting a destructive path through the region and causing a fatal crash in Alabama.
