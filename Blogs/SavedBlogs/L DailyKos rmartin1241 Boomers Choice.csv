L, Boomer's Choice, rmartin1241, 2021-04-27, Like Sophie’s Choice the 1979 William Styron novel (and 1982 film adaptation that brought Meryl Streep her second Oscar for best actress) Baby Boomers (full disclosure — I am one) are now faced with a choice that although it is not as unbearable and malevolently imposed as Sophie’s will affect the future of our generation the ones behind us and the fate of the American experiment.  A recent analysis/opinion piece by Hayes Brown at MSNBC might make the decision a little easier for Boomers (and the outcome a little brighter for America) if Brown’s thesis (that Republican lawmakers are cutting off their nose to spite their face) is true.  Brown argues that Boomers are reaching the age of retirement and this milestone often triggers a watershed reassessment of retiree’s priorities. He focuses on the tendency for elders to become (a) more politically conservative and (b) more likely to vote. While both are true (on average; DK readers certainly know many exceptions) I would also argue that the underlying mechanism of this chronological divide is that retirees have more time available to contemplate what to do with their golden years when their earning power is diminished. Should they unselfishly and fearlessly volunteer to help others which makes their communities proud of them?  Or should they selfishly fear their lifestyle will deteriorate as their savings are depleted which makes them easy prey for demagogues who promise a halcyon future if voters elect them to positions of power?  Brown finds it odd that “...Republicans in Congress are casting boomers to the side … in favor of making President Joe Biden look bad.”  He cites GOP members of Congress who have been poking fun at Biden’s emphasis on elder caregiving as a vital aspect of his infrastructure plan as being particularly guilty of foolishness for not realizing that such services will be vital to boomers down the road.  Frankly I’m not surprised that Republicans today are willing to adopt any foolish position if they think it will earn them votes. We’ve been through just that in the last four years of Trumpism — no strategic direction just a bunch of impulse tweets that are designed to increase fears and to disrupt the status quo. The GOP power grabbers have made it their mission to create a fog of war (culture or otherwise) so they can capitalize on the fears of anyone who is vulnerable (or more precisely who is white and feels vulnerable).  So not to be melodramatic about the Styron comparison the very serious choice facing boomers right now is which side of the culture war do you want to support? Will you take up arms with red side that uses lying cheating and jettisoning democracy to keep old white guys in power (even when those OWG have no actual strategy for the future)? Or will you give aid and comfort to the blue side that really does want to empower all people especially those that are currently being ill-served by our economy and government — at the price of taking some wealth and power away from ultra-millionaires and billionaires (who already have too much of both)? So Hey Boomer — your choice is this: Vote for the side that lies always especially when it says it wants to fatten your 401k or vote for the side that honestly wants to preserve democracy (and the economy) for our children and their children.  In my golden years I am making it my mission to pose this choice as clearly as possible to my aging peers in the hopes that I’ll help some of them move back from the cliff that could plunge them into full-on white nationalism fascism and totalitarianism (...i.e. the red side if there was any doubt)!
