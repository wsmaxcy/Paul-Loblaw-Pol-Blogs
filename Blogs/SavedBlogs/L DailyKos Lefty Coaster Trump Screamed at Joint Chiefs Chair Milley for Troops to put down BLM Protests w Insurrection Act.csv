L, Trump Screamed at Joint Chiefs Chair Milley for Troops to put down BLM Protests w Insurrection Act, Lefty Coaster, 2021-06-28, Is there any bottom to the depraved depths of Mr. Trump’s presidency? He wanted a military solution for protests seeking some measure of social justice in policing that were sweeping the nation much to Mr. Trump’s chagrin. By Jonathan Swan  Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff repeatedly blew up at President Trump over how to handle last summer's racial-justice protests The Wall Street Journal's Michael Bender writes in his forthcoming book "Frankly We Did Win This Election."
