L, Biden’s SCOTUS Commission: Public Meeting this Week, Villanova Rhodes, 2021-06-28, The Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States will hold its first substantive public meeting on Wednesday June 30 from 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. (ET). At this virtual meeting the Commission will hear from 19 subject-matter experts grouped in panels to address four broad topics.⦁    Panel #1: The Contemporary Debate over Supreme Court Reform: Origins and Perspectives⦁    Panel #2: The Court’s Role in Our Constitutional System⦁    Panel #3: Case Selection and Review at the Supreme Court⦁    Panel #4: Access to Justice and Transparency in the Operation of the Supreme Court At the commission’s website you can view the list of speakers and download their written testimony. These panels are a first crack at the research areas the Commission laid out at its first meeting on May 19 (h/t to Katie Barlow at scotusblog.com for the summary): You can get a fuller overview of what the commission intends to cover in its work by watching the video of its first meeting starting at about the 35:00 mark. (Easter egg: If you pay close attention to the Youtube transcript you’ll find a delightful rendering of “certiorari.”) The meeting will be live-streamed and presumably its recording posted on the commission website and the White House’s Youtube channel as with the May 19 meeting. I don’t see any particular advantage to registering for the meeting but if you do send an email to info@pcscotus.gov with the Subject: Registration. In the body of the email provide your full name organization (if applicable) email address and phone number. Registration requests must be received by 5:00 p.m. ET on Monday June 28 2021. Another panel-based meeting is expected in July. Info on how to submit a public comment and read those by others can be found here.  It’s a little late for this meeting but the overall comment period runs until mid-November. The commission is charged with among other things analyzing proposed reforms — but not with making recommendations. Its report is due within 180 days of its May 19 meeting. Not all expected testimony has been posted as I write and I have only been able to skim what’s there. A few preliminary observations related to the arguments and issues commonly raised here... The panels are diverse; generally professorial but beyond law faculties and beyond the United States. Papers include an international comparative law perspective both in nuts & bolts (tenure and court size) and in how these choices further democracy — or don’t. Witnesses do not shy from questioning the Court’s history of comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted. Several spell out what they believe the commission’s fundamental questions should be: What is the Supreme Court good for in the context of our existing institutions? And would specific reform proposals advance or impede the objectives that the Court ought to serve? (Noah Feldman) Some are prescriptive: I believe you should evaluate the proposals for reforming the Supreme Court by asking whether they will make the United States more democratic. That is you should ask whether the reforms will extend or protect the political equality of all Americans so that each one of us possesses equal political and social standing to share in controlling our national community. You should advocate for reforms that will help bring democracy to our workplaces our legislatures and our fundamental law before we lose what democracy we have. (Nikolas Bowie) Judicial review and structural issues. Multiple witnesses tackle constitutional interpretation and judicial review specifically (methods strong v. weak-form) and SCOTUS’s role in our governmental structure generally. Professors Kim Scheppele and Rosalind Dixon among others put these in a comparative international context. Historian/law professor (and ex-Sotomayor clerk) Nikolas Bowie has a remarkable paper on historical and theoretical problems with judicial review describing how the Court protects wealthy and repeat players but “is at best unreliable at protecting politically marginalized groups.” Naturally he’s got receipts from Dred Scott to Shelby County. Professor of jurisprudence and of history Samuel Moyn tackles Breyeresque approaches that seek “to buttress or restore Supreme Court’s legitimacy — or to oppose any reform because it might do more to erode remaining legitimacy” arguing:  It is an impossible mission to seek to depoliticize a political court difficult in the extreme to distract from the fact that it is one and normatively wrong to do so. … [L]egitimacy is never itself the justification of an institution. In a democracy the value by which to judge institutions (to safeguard if they serve it and reform them if not) is whether they advance or incarnate collective self-rule. Worth a full read. (But also read Noah Feldman who presents Breyer’s side better than Breyer!) Moyn discusses various “disempowering” reforms including jurisdiction channeling and stripping requiring supermajorities for certain decisions and statutorily reassigning finality to the Congress. Number and tenure of justices. The political context of proposed term limits and court expansion is not ignored. There’s general but not universal agreement that mandatory term limits would require a constitutional amendment (retirement incentives no) and of course all agree that court size can be changed by statute. Historian Laura Kalman who is writing a book on the political history of FDR's "court-packing" plan summarizes that history with lessons for today’s pro- and anti-expansionists. Unsurprisingly there’s more to the story than you’ll get from Wikipedia. Political scientist Maya Sen presents public opinion data on term limits (favored-ish) and expansion (mostly disfavored) but adds to the debate by projecting the effects of expansion wars on likely SCOTUS growth over the next 100 years (not great but not catastrophic). Because no one ignores the political context and the witnesses understand how courts have changed since the days of circuit-riding no one suggests linking the number of justices to the number of circuits. But see Steve Vladeck’s testimony for insights into the role of “Circuit Justice” its importance to the “shadow docket” and suggestions for reform. Caseload per se is not seen as a reason to expand SCOTUS which has near-total control over its own workload. Nor is the number of decisions produced (a/k/a expansionists’ “The food is terrible – and such small portions!” complaint). But the nature of the SCOTUS caseload and how it’s handled are a different kettle of fish. Court operations. Various witnesses consider the certiorari process (with Michael Dreeben’s piece especially accessible) jurisdiction issues (maybe SCOTUS shouldn’t have quite so much docket control) the trouble with “fact-y” amicus briefs (Allison Orr Larsen) and the effect of downstream resource problems. Judith Resnik widens the lens on an entire system of federal adjudication inadequate in quantity and quality. She explains how a dearth of resources below – judges yes but more so legal representation and litigation costs – detrimentally affects SCOTUS inputs and outputs as well as equity. Vladeck’s discussion of the “shadow docket” warrants a post of its own but I encourage you to read it to understand the enormity of what’s happening now that conservative power has been consolidated as well as for his suggested changes. Deepak Gupta explains the relationship of the shadow docket to corporate skew lack of diversity (bench and bar) and specific transparency proposals. Amy Howe of SCOTUSblog fame reflects on court experiences during the pandemic and provides a detailed list of transparency suggestions concerning video and audio proceedings access to judges’ financial reports and clearer practices on the justices’ health disclosures. It feels a little small-ball in this lineup but could produce concrete improvements sooner than the others.
