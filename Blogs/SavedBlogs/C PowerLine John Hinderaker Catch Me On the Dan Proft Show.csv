C, Catch Me On the Dan Proft Show, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-16, I am guest hosting the Dan Proft Show on the Salem radio network tonight tomorrow night and Friday night. The show airs from 9 p.m. to midnight Eastern time.  We have already recorded tonight’s show so I can assure you that it is good. I’m sure Wednesday’s and Friday’s shows will be worth listening to as well. If you are free please tune in. If you miss it the program is also podcasted here. And if you are not familiar with Dan he is an excellent host and worth catching if you are awake! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
