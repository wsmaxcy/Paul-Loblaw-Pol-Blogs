L, Blatant open racism is ok on facebook., account5, 2021-04-19, I recently had an experience with blatant open racism on facebook that looked like it might have been written by William B. Pierce himself.On a thread on the foxnews fb page discussing the endless cases of police murdering unarmed black men a woman posted a long very racist diatribe about how “the african race will always hate us” because they were just so genetically inferior to whites.These are links screencaps i took before i reported it to facebook.You can see how totally racist it was in the sense of ‘scientific racism”  and how fb reacted to the report. Meanwhile I’m on a 30 fb jail stint for calling a christian conservative arrogant.I hope fb gets some grilling over this. They can;t claim it wasn’t reported and they sonsidered it acceptable.Hopefully this will generate some reaction from daily kos asides from instamatically cancel culturing me after one post as they have done time and time again.flic.kr/…flic.kr/…flic.kr/…flic.kr/…
