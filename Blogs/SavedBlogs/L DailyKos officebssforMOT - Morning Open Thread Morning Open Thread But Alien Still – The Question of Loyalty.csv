There were people who spoke out against it even at the time including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt but the attack on Pearl Harbor swept America with a wave of fury which drowned out the dissenting voices. Mitsuye Yasutake 18 years old was one of the many young Americans whose families lost their livelihoods their homes and their civil rights to that wave. Mitsuye Yamada (July 5 1923 – ) born as Mitsuye Yasutake in Fukuoka Japan; Japanese-American human rights activist feminist fiction author poet essayist editor and professor of English. Her parents were both first-generation Japanese Americans living in the U.S. but they were visiting Japan when she was born. In 1926 the family moved to Seattle where her father was an interpreter for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. He was wrongfully accused and arrested by the FBI for espionage after Pearl Harbor so she and her family were interned at Mindoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. She was allowed to leave to attend college after she renounced loyalty to the Emperor of Japan. Her first book Camp Notes and Other Poems was written during the war but was not published until 1976. She had to become a “naturalized” U.S. citizen in 1955 five years after her marriage to Yoshikasu Yamada who was born in Hawaii and served as a medic and a translator in the U.S. Army during WWII.
