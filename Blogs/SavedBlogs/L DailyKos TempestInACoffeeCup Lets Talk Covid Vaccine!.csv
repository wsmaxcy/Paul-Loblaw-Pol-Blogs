L, Let's Talk Covid Vaccine!, TempestInACoffeeCup, 2021-05-09, Are you or someone you know still on the fence about the vaccine? Do you know someone who ‘needs a little more information’ before committing to getting their shot? Tune in next Sunday May 16 at 2 pm CT for a free conversation about the vaccine online. The program will be on Zoom and FB Live. We will discuss: We will be joined by Michael Baker Policy Advisor at the US Dept. of Health & Human Services focusing on the pandemic. To get to the 70% goal by July 4 we need to get those who are still on the fence to join in to protect everyone and beat this virus.  RSVP here and please share this around.
