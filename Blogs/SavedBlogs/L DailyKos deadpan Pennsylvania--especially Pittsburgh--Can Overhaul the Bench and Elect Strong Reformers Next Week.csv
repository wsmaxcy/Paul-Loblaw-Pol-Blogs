L, Pennsylvania--especially Pittsburgh--Can Overhaul the Bench and Elect Strong Reformers Next Week, deadpan, 2021-05-10, Pennsylvania elects its judges and elects them in odd-numbered years—in 1 week’s time we will be having our primary elections for some important judgeships.  These will shape the PA bench for some time to come—and we saw last fall how much judges matter.  One PA judge even sided with Trump to opine that mail voting is unconstitutional—thankfully the PA Supreme Court quickly overruled her.  But now she seeks to join that Court.  Also on a local level Pittsburgh has a real chance to revamp the bench and add some strong progressive reformers.  With 39 (!) candidates for 9 slots the race is wide open and several strong criminal justice reformers are running.  Scroll down if those are the races you are interested in.  STATEWIDE:First up the PA Supreme Court.  Highest court in PA which has played a key role in restoring/preserving democracy in PA—ordered fair maps to replace the GOP congressional gerrymander in 2018 rejected Trump’s spurious lawsuits in 2020.  Democrats have only one candidate for the sole vacancy which is created by the retirement (due to term limits) of a Republican.  Thus our majority will either stay at 5-2 or grow to 6-1.  Our candidate is Maria McLaughlin a judge on one of our two intermediate-level appellate courts.  She is a strong contender.  When she won her current office in 2017 she got the most votes in a 9-candidate field (the top four were elected).  She showed some crossover pull getting some ancestral D votes in SWPA as well as cleaning up in metro Philly where she is from.  Basically every labor union you can think of has endorsed her and that matters in lower-turnout races like these.  With McLaughlin we have a real chance.  Republicans have a choice of three candidates.  One of these is Patricia McCullough the judge who sided with Trump to say that mail voting is unconstitutional.  The others are Kevin Brobson who’s on the same court as McCullough and Paula Patrick a trial judge in Philadelphia.  Due to PA political geography Patrick has almost no chance—most of PA’s Republican electorate doesn’t live in Philadelphia and indeed distrusts Philadelphia.  The primary ballot lists candidates’ home counties.  The real contest will be between Brobson of Harrisburg and McCullough of Pittsburgh.  Next the Commonwealth Court.  This is one of PA’s two intermediate-level appellate courts and PA’s second-most important court.  It has jurisdiction over cases involving state agencies regulations—and elections.  In other words it hears many politically-charged cases.  It is currently dominated by Republicans who have a 7-2 majority—but there are two seats coming open this year which means Democrats could gain 2 seats.  That will matter when Republicans try their next coup.  Trumpy judge Patricia McCullough?  She’s on this court.  Democrats have 4 candidates for the 2 slots so it’s important to choose carefully.  Regardless we can make some history and diversify the bench—3 of our 4 candidates are Black women so we will be nominating a Black woman.  She would be just the second Black woman ever to serve on this court.  We have: I will be voting for Spurgeon and either Dumas or Green-Hawkins.  I think that would be our best bet to win both seats.  Just not sure whether Dumas or Green-Hawkins is the better choice. Finally there is the Superior Court.  The other PA intermediate appellate court the Superior Court hears the bulk of civil and criminal appeals.  There is one open seat and whoever wins it will get an 8-7 majority on the Court.  Control is up for grabs.  Democrats have three candidates: Jill Beck a Pittsburgh attorney; Bryan Neft also a Pittsburgh attorney; and Timika Lane a Philadelphia trial judge.  My sense is that Neft has no chance and the real contest is between Beck (supported by most western PA groups/officials) and Lane (supported by eastern PA groups/officials).  I’m undecided. PITTSBURGH—OVERHAUL THE BENCH AND ELECT SOME REFORMERSNow we get to some important local races—Allegheny County (Pittsburgh + suburbs) will be replacing 25% of its judges this year quite a lot at once.  We have 9 judicial vacancies.  One judge resigned after he got caught demeaning a Black juror as “Aunt Jemima.”  The other vacancies were created by the premature death of Judge John Zottola the promotion of Judge Robert Colville to be a federal district court judge and several retirements.  We’ve seen through the election of progressive prosecutors what is possible at the local level.  We can achieve great results through the election of progressive judges too.  Whom to elect of 39(!) candidates?  Let’s start with Lisa Middleman who has been a public defender in Allegheny County for decades represented BLM protestors last year and challenged conservadem DA Stephen Zappala in 2019 running as an independent (no Republican filed).  Zappala prevailed though winning 57-43.  Middleman did well in Pittsburgh proper but Zappala won in most of the suburbs.  With a crowded field a favorable ballot position (Middleman is listed second on the Democratic ballot of the 39 candidates) residual name recognition and increased support for criminal justice reform among Democratic voters Middleman has a chance.  Joining forces with Middleman are Nicola Henry-Taylor and Mik Pappas.  They too are reform-oriented candidates and have teamed with Middleman to form a ticket of sorts.  www.pghcitypaper.com/… Henry-Taylor is campaigning on reforming the criminal justice system and has experience examining police use of force policies and court rules on bail probation and incarceration according to her website. ...Middleman ran in 2019 as a progressive independent for Allegheny County District Attorney calling for an end to cash bail. She ultimately lost to incumbent DA Stephen Zappala. Middleman also represented many Black Lives Matter protesters last summer after police charged dozens of them with misdemeanor charges even though police used less-lethal weapons like tear gas and pepper spray on protesters....Pappas as a Magistrate District Judge says he has eliminated the use of cash bail in his East End district and has also lowered eviction rates by working closely with landlords and tenants. I’ll likely select them as 3 of my 9 choices.  After that—there is Tiffany Sizemore a law professor at Duquesne University: www.publicsource.org/… When news came that the Minneapolis Public Schools proposed to cut ties with their local police force local lawyer Tiffany Sizemore saw an opportunity for kids across the Pittsburgh Public Schools district. So Sizemore who leads the Juvenile Defender Clinic at Duquesne University alongside Jeff Shook an associate professor of social work at the University of Pittsburgh penned an open call for Pittsburgh Public Schools to stop using police to manage children in their schools. Instead they want to see an investment in restorative practices along with counseling and mental health services. Her university page states that she “focuses on dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline.”  She’s what we need.  Choice 4.  Five more to go.  There is a coalition of criminal justice reform groups in Pittsburgh that has endorsed 8 candidates total—the above 4 plus Zeke Rediker Giuseppe Rosselli Wrenna Watson and Chelsa Wagner: theappeal.org/… “This is an opportunity to be transformative in terms of how our courts look how our courts feel for the public and the types of policy reforms that can be implemented” said Tiffany Sizemore a professor at Duquesne University School of Law and former public defender who is part of the Slate of Eight. ...Nicola Henry-Taylor Lisa Middleman Mik Pappas Zeke Rediker Giuseppe Rosselli Chelsa Wagner and Wrenna Watson round out the slate; most are criminal defense lawyers or former public defenders. Organizers supporting the slate say they chose these candidates because of their commitment to reforms like reducing the use of cash bail curtailing long sentences diverting drug cases and limiting the involvement of minors with the criminal legal system. That all sounds great to me.  Also Rediker is just 33 years old and would thus bring a new generational perspective as well which is sorely needed in the modern day.  There are at least a couple other candidates worth highlighting.  Tom Caulfield though not endorsed by this coalition was also a public defender for a couple decades.  He’s currently a magistrate judge.  And seldom uses cash bail: www.wesa.fm/… The study also found that magisterial district judges who set bail in criminal cases varied widely in their use of bail. Magistrate Thomas Caulfield in Braddock Hills the report said assigned bail in less than 2 percent of cases compared to about 58% for Magistrate Michael Thatcher in South Park. Caulfield is also rated “Highly Recommended” by the local bar (so is Henry-Taylor).  In Caulfield’s words:  Myth:  Use of cash bail makes society safer. Fact:  Studies show the opposite to be true.  Cash bail makes it more likely a person will commit a future crime. I follow the facts and that’s why I don’t use cash bail as a Judge. https://t.co/eOxhh82OLP Another good candidate is Alyssa Cowan.  She has focused her legal career on helping neglected/abused children.  She also leaves little doubt what she thinks of the Republican Party.  triblive.com/… The first-time candidate is seeking the Democratic Party nomination in the May 18 primary forgoing the traditional practice of judicial candidates to cross-file. “I couldn’t in good conscience list myself on the ballot as a Republican as the modern GOP sadly continues to align itself with practices that openly advocate against certain segments of our community” Cowan said. “Providing any type of endorsement to this behavior even if in just tacit acknowledgment on the ballot would jeopardize my commitment to serving every person in our community.”  Her professional career has been dedicated to helping abused and neglected children through the legal system with stints at the Statewide Adoption and Permanency Network (SWAN) KidsVoice and as an assistant attorney general in the Child Protection Section of Washington D.C.’s Office of the Attorney General. Cowan said her work experience has taught her to navigate the emotional aspects of working in court. Currently according to the article she’s assistant county solicitor for child protection services.  She also has a degree in social work.  Like Caulfield and Henry-Taylor Cowan is “Highly Recommended” by the bar.  (I personally don’t put much stock in those ratings especially after Trump but it’s a bonus.).  There is also George Heym.  He’s got the endorsement of a couple progressive groups 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club and OnePA (both groups have endorsed Sizemore Wagner and Middleman as well.  14th Ward endorsed Henry-Taylor and OnePA endorsed Cowan).  Brian Malkin has been endorsed by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (so has Sizemore).  Malkin too is on board with important reforms like restorative justice and ending cash bail.  Another progressive endorsement slate posted by Henry-Taylor:  Partners for Progress SWPA Announced Recommendations for Allegheny County Court Of Common Pleas Judges! Proud to be included on the list! pic.twitter.com/rjw7DRo9Xs So many good choices! It can also be important to know who not to vote for: www.post-gazette.com/... Mr. DeMarco [GOP County Councilman] said his committee is only endorsing one candidate: Joseph Patrick Murphy the sole Republican running for a seat on the court. But he plans on recommending other candidates based on their experience and temperament. He named Judge Beemer Judge Howsie County Solicitor Andy Szefi and attorney Jason Cervone as people he thought would be good choices.  With so many good candidates that’s basically all I need to know about the ones he names.  Also not getting my votes are Bill Caye and Mark Patrick Flaherty both with prior records as conservadems.  I have not decided on all 9 but my likely choices so far look something like this: I’ll add Caulfield to my list because he’s reform-oriented (even if less outspoken) and I think he has a strong chance to actually be elected.  He received the local party endorsement—the local party sucks but the endorsement can matter in these kinds of races.  Plus I use my family as a sort of reality check—they’re Democrats but not progressive ones.  Talking up criminal justice reform won’t sway them.  (In one case it will put him off entirely.) They tend to vote for judicial candidates based on other factors like experience and bar association evaluations.  They’ll vote for Tom Caulfield.  Not because he’s a reformer but because they think he’s well-qualified and experienced.  I take these two things as indicators that Tom Caulfield has a good chance to actually win one of the 9 seats.  And his record indicates he is the sort of reformer we need so I’ll support him.  Sizemore and Middleman have terrific records and are backed by basically every progressive group you can think of.  Henry-Taylor is backed by most has an inspiring personal story and her “highly recommended” rating will help her with people like my family.  I wanted to highlight these races for people because opportunities like this to reshape the bench do not come along often.  If you know people in PA—especially Allegheny County—please pass this info along!
