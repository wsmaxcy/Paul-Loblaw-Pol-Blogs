C, A spark when ignites lead to huge fire, Hamid Enayat, 2020-10-13,  “The economy in Iran is declining day by day and is approaching state disintegration. Economic issues affect livelihoods culture and norms but on top of all create the distrust that is deep-rooted in society. “We need to find a society that no longer trusts the baseless rhetoric of officials the government the economy minister and the central bank governor.” Arman the state-run media outlet warns on September 21 2020) that warns. What the pro-government media calls “public distrust” is an acknowledgment of anger close to the point of the explosion that is now woven into the fabric of Iranian society. At both ends of the spectrum on the one hand we see a government that is mired in incurable crises and is doing everything to hold on to power at the cost of daily executions and on the other the wrath in an “inflamed and troubled society that can arise at any moment. The Friday prayer of Isfahan called for “insecurity” in the society for the perpetrators who do not obey the dress code “ignoring the hijab” in the parks and advised the security police to take this issue seriously. He had previously said that “wet wood” should always be raised to combat “indecency.” (Radio German Farsi site October 2 2020) The Deputy Commander of the Police Force also announced the “planning and implementation of four surveillance projects in cars passages department stores entertainment venues sidewalks and internet to combat “indecency.” For more than three decades the Iranian regime with more than twenty organs has been repressing humiliating and harassing women under the disguise of countering ill-treatment in order to curb the anger and protest of dissatisfied youth so that to prevent turning into another nationwide uprising. For some time now the regime has been conducting all kinds of patrols in cities and streets from a patrol to prevent “bad hijab” “fight against thugs” and a “corona patrol” in Isfahan. But in recent weeks insurgent youths in Tehran Shiraz Isfahan and Mashhad have set fire to the regime’s repression training and promotion centers in protest to the execution of Navid Afkari Iran’s wrestling champion. On Sunday September 27 the court that specifically sentenced Navid Afkari to death in the city of Shiraz Navid’s hometown was targeted and set on fire by insurgent youth. Insurgent youths also torched large photo of Khamenei Khomeini and Qassem Soleimani in a number of cities. These activities scared the regime especially as many of these young rebels organized themselves. Plan to deal with “bad hijab” Not only does misogyny arise from the regime’s medieval thinking but it also a way for the regime to control. Therefore in addition to the plan to combat bad hijab a plan to combat thugs and corona patrols has also been launched in Isfahan. The head of the judiciary who is being touted as a possible successor to Khamenei has stated that the streets and neighborhoods and centers of evil should not be allowed to be used.
The National Security Council (an organ of control and repression under the Ministry of Interior) ordered the establishment of bases in the provinces and cities to combat these individuals. The purpose of these bases which have recently been established in all cities of Iran is to prevent an uprising in the future. Corona however came to the aid of the regime for the time being and delayed the uprising. Khamenei had said that we should make Corona an opportunity. And what could this opportunity be other than the survival of the regime? And for this reason the regime is not taking serious action against Corona. But oblivious that when the threshold of the corona death and the sick passes will become the choking rope for the regime.
The three-week campaign to prevent Navid’s execution on the one hand and the post-execution reflection on the other proves well that the flames of anger can never be extinguished by the regime. People and government on both sides of an explosive rage We see that the regime is constantly undergoing surgery and shrinkage in order to maintain itself.
The media affiliated with the Iranian regime have repeatedly warned of an impending explosion. Khamenei knows full well that there is no escaping from an explosion of anger. But he seems to be under the illusion that it is possible to overwhelm most of the society’s revolts by suppressing them.
The hasty executions of demonstrators and the creation of an epidemic of torture on the one hand and the “narrowing of the circle of insiders” on the other does not prevent the outburst. According to the affiliated paper of the regime “Iranian society is inflamed and there is a possibility of an uprising at any moment if this Match is set alight it will be very difficult to extinguish the fire.” The Daily Star August 1 2020.
