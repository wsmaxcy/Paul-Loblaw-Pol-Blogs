C, Biden’s Obsession Breaks Out, John Hinderaker, 2021-05-29, Over the last 18 hours or so this video has been widely shared. If you haven’t already seen it it opens another window onto Joe Biden’s mental state:  Many have seen this as another instance of Biden’s weird obsession with little girls. Yes but I think the truth is worse than that. Biden’s handlers have undoubtedly warned him many times not to act inappropriately toward little girls but when he goes off-script as here he can’t help himself. As indicated too by the manner in which he speaks I think Biden is well into his dotage. Like many elderly people suffering from dementia he is prone to blurting out inappropriate thoughts that happen to cross his mind. Biden’s condition is obviously a matter of concern on national security grounds as well as others. Yet our press will steadfastly avert its eyes and pretend that all is well right up until the moment when Biden collapses in public or commits a blunder too serious to be ignored. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
