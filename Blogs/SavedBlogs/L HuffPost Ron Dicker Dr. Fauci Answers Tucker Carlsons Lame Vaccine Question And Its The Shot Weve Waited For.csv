L, Dr. Fauci Answers Tucker Carlson's Lame Vaccine Question And It's The Shot We've Waited For, Ron Dicker, 2021-05-05, Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday answered one of Tucker Carlson’s skewed questions about the COVID-19 vaccine briefly inoculating viewers against the Fox News host’s anti-vaccine fearmongering. (Watch the clip below.) As part of his right-wing channel’s apparent campaign to sow doubt about vaccine safety and effectiveness Carlson has been raising what he presents as deal-breaking questions that actually have verifiable answers. Which of course he fails to acknowledge. But on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” the nation’s top infectious disease expert entertained one of Carlson’s leading queries. After people on the street asked Fauci questions Kimmel noted one more guy had one. He cut to a clip of Carlson asking why college students should get the vaccine because “young people are not at risk of dying from COVID” and many have been infected already. “No one has explained that” Carlson said. Kimmel let Fauci take it away. “One you want to protect yourself” the White House task force doc replied. “But also you don’t want to be part of the propagation of the outbreak. Because if you get infected even though you’re young and healthy ... you could pass it on to someone else who could have a severe outcome. And when you get infected you are propagating the outbreak. You’re not being a dead stop. You’re allowing the virus to continue from you to someone else.” Got that Tucker?
