L, Top Comments:  Something I'm Not Going to Miss, gizmo59forTop Comments, 2021-04-22, As happens every year I delayed scheduling my riding mower maintenance until it was impossible to avoid the service backlog that the local John Deere dealer gets into in the spring as everybody is having their mowers serviced.  Six weeks could pass before I will see my mower again and the lawn will become a jungle.  They are scheduled to pick up the mower tomorrow.  When this was all scheduled last week in order to get a little ahead of the lawn I had decided to try to mow the lawn today.  Then on Monday I heard the weather forecast and decided to mow on Tuesday instead because it’s difficult to mow your lawn in the snow. There is a local songwriter by the name of David Sturtevant who wrote a song about how his grandfather always told him that snow has to fall on the crocuses three times before summer will come.  We had a fairly large snowstorm last month large enough that I thought that perhaps that could count for maybe two and a half snowfalls on the crocuses—but apparently not. All of this is happening two and a half months before we retire and move to California in a region where we are extremely unlikely to be troubled by snow.  Personally I don’t mind snow in the winter but come late April it has long since worn out its welcome.  I’m ready for a change.

From inkstainedwretch: This comment by Carmeninvermont posted to Elixa’s diary Thoroughly pissed of because of a TERF.  Great comment to an important diary about how people seemingly decent on one specific issue can be completely horrible otherwise. From Satya1: MistyRT makes a great comment with a factual measured response to a highly flawed and insensitive diary.
