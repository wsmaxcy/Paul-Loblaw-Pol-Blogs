L, A Sacramento Health Care Hunger Games, ExperimentFading, 2021-04-29,  This Sacramento Story Is An All-American Story The Sacramento unified public school system is insolvent due to health care costs. A fight over health care costs and benefits is a’happening now. All will lose meaning all will pay more and get less care because that is how health care hunger games go. Those who lose least are called winners. Here’s the lay of the land outside the school doors: Sacramento Has A Large Health Care Desert Sacramento is a health care desert surrounded by a sea of un- and underinsured people. The red island on the map is the health care desert. The population in this health care desert is 400K and all 400K are un- and underinsured. The pic is from a lecture by a UC Davis urban sociologist who has studied the health care woes of this core of Sacramento (communities called South Sacramento North Highlands). Over many years millions of dollars in grant monies have been funneled into the desert by organizations known as health insurance conversion foundations.  Health insurance conversion foundations control Billions captured by nonprofit health insurance companies. These foundations operate all over Sacramento the region and state and the country. (There used to be but is no longer a Wikipedia page on “health insurance conversion foundations”.)  Mandated by both courts and electeds health insurance conversion foundations are mandated to spend the ill-gotten billions and billions on the health of Californians with a focus on those living in health care deserts. The millions granted have done nothing are doing nothing to attend to the health care desert status of this area. And so the desert status is effectively permanent cemented in and policy locked. Health insurance conversion foundations work synergistically with the courtier journalists working the health care beat. The Sea of Un- and Underinsured Citizens Then there are all those living in the area outside of the Sacramento health care desert. The majority of these Californians are called The Middle Class ($44K-$139K). The Middle class is all un- and underinsured. (Worldwide CoViD kicked 14.6 million people off health insurance coverage. All 14.6M were Americans so fair guesstimate: Many Sacramentans.) Please see the tweet out of the nationally recognized Kaiser Family Foundation as it regards the Middle Class. The American Middle Class is unrepresented and undefended and is unaware of their status. They are also unaware that wellness and healthy habits confer no protection from sucker punches to the chin. Kaiser Family Foundation is a different type of health care foundation than a health insurance conversion foundation. But if it’s called a “health care foundation” it is working synergistically with other health care foundations and the courtier journalists working the health care beat.  Regarding The Un-Representing Electeds In California Pre-CoViD the California electeds created a Health Care Commission (scroll to bottom of website homepage to view Commissioners).  Filling seats on the Commission are representatives of the health insurance conversion foundations. Also filling seats are individuals and organizations whose paychecks and organizations’ existence is dependent upon the grant monies from the health insurance conversion foundations.Also filling the seats are union representatives. Sacramento public school teachers and the other 4 unions in the school district are unrepresented times two on the issue of health care. First as citizens and second as union members because the prevailing national union powers powerfully oppose any fix the financing of health care. Because of this unions only deliver lose-least. The California Legislature works synergistically with health care foundations or all sorts and the courtier journalists who work the health care beat. A Successful Health Care Hunger Games Requires Strong Local Leadership The Sacramento Mayor and a Sacramento County Supervisor offered well-wishes to all hunger games participants: “Sacrifice and compromise necessary to avoid insolvency protect Sacramento schools” Exactly wrong. Sacrifice and compromise are bully-mechanisms used in the health care hunger games swindle. As a matter of reality and policy fact fixing the financing of health care is what will fully protect Sacramento schools and everyone in them and outside their doors city state and country. Local electeds work synergistically with local media (The Sacramento Bee Capital Public Radio CalMatters) and state electeds and health care foundations and courtier journalists who work the health care beat. The 109-year American Health Care History (in 300 words): In the first decade of the 20th century we knew we were ruining the climate lead was deadly and the multipayer financing of health care would be profitable and ruinous.  Nationalizing health insurance was first proposed by Teddy Roosevelt (R) in 1912. During the 20th century it was the physician profession (via the American Medical Association) who created the systemless multipayer health care system AND funded the creation of the public relations machine to protect it all from reform. The most notable and informative battle in the 109-year fight over the fixing of the financing of health care took place in California in 1945. It was a battle between The California Medical Association and California Governor Earl Warren (R). This bit of California history is told very well here (and not at all in our schools). This pointedly relevant New Yorker article is long. To cut to the chase start reading at “Warren got a serious kidney infection”. Then! Then in the 1960s the non-profit insurance companies called “The Blues” realized those Billions and Billions and Billions in profits and so became for-profit entities.  The Billions in profits captured by the non-profit insurance companies would by decree of courts and electeds be given over to newly formed private entities called health insurance conversion foundations. Take home lesson here:  From the moment the non-profit insurance companies became multi-Billion dollar for-profit entities our electeds -- red and blue took on the national chore of protecting the multipayer financing of American health care. This was the moment that representation on the issue of health care ceased to exist in the United States — and a monster called the Medical Industrial Complex was birthed. The Medical Industrial Complex having now fully captured the levers of American power has sights set globally.  HEADS-UP WORLD! The American Medical Industrial Complex Your Way Cometh! Make haste to defend! But Meanwhile Back In Sacramento It’s an ongoing full scale health care-created financial bleeding of city and citizens. And a public relations poke-in-the-eye to go with it all: Sutter Health and Sutter Medical Foundation bless their hearts are hosting graduation ceremonies for Sacramento grads...just as the Sacramento Health Care Hunger Games commence in earnest. It’s going to be stadiums of unrepresented Sacramentans who have no idea that they are in a health care hunger games. Stadiums of Sacramentans who have for thinking representation is a thing when it is not have already locked down the “Lose Most” category in this round of the Sacramento Health Care Hunger Games — where the games have really yet to heat up.
