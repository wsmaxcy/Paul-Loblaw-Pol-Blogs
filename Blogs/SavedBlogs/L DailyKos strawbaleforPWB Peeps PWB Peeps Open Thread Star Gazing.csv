L, PWB Peeps Open Thread: Star Gazing, strawbaleforPWB Peeps, 2021-04-26, Starfish have been around for at least 450 million years. (Finding the fossils is difficult because they tend to disintegrate after death.) They occur everywhere from the intertidal zone to the abyssal plane of the ocean. Most can only move a few inches per minute but the fastest ones can manage a whole 9+ feet per minute. For a starfish thatâ€™s really booking it! They can shed and regrow a leg to escape a predator like the way some lizards can shed their tails. They can also reproduce this way as the shed arm can regrow a whole new body. Or they can make babies the more traditional way. PWBPeeps is a group that posts a daily diary and nightly open thread for animal lovers. We share photos seek & give advice about pet health and behavior issues support each other in times of sadness and stress celebrate together when times are good and on most days have an inordinate amount of fun.
