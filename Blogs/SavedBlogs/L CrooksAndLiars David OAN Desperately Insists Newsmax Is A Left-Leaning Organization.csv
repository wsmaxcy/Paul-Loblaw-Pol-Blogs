L, OAN Desperately Insists Newsmax Is A 'Left-Leaning Organization', David, 2021-05-24, 	OAN a conservative news channel spent the weekend trying to convince its viewers that conservative competitor Newsmax is a "left-leaning organization." 	In a report that was aired over the weekend OAN's Pearson Sharp suggested that Newsmax and Fox News could no longer be considered "reliable" news sources because the outlets had recognized President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. 	"For a long time conservatives could count on Fox News for an honest take on what was going on" Sharp opined. "But as we saw during this last election Fox jumped ship and headed for waters that were a lot darker blue." 	"Then there's Newsmax which likes to project an image of being a home for conservatives right-leaning or at the very least center-right news" he continued. "But is that really the case? If you dig deeper under the Newsmax image of so-called conservative news you'll find a very different much more left-leaning organization." 	According to Sharpe "Newsmax threw Trump under the bus and buckled almost immediately declaring Biden the next president despite all the evidence of massive fraud and without waiting for the contested battleground states to finish their investigations." 	The OAN correspondent also hit Newsmax for "changing direction" after the network was sued by an employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Newsmax later issued an apology and said that it had found no evidence that allegations of vote tampering were true. 	"Is that what honest journalism looks like?" Sharp asked. 	OAN's report on Newsmax first aired Friday. By Sunday the network had repeated the segment over two dozen times. 	Watch a clip from OAN below.
