L, Thank you for your generosity! My fundraising goal is met plus a buffer!, roses, 2021-04-25, Hi everyone! This will be short and very very sweet. I just wanted to let everyone who didn’t happen to see this info yesterday that my fundraising goal was met and some people contributed further to give me a buffer. My goal was $5600 and the total raised was $6366!!! I understand (now) that there will be some fees deducted by GoFundMe so the buffer will easily take care of that and more. It is extra comforting to know that I do have a buffer since unexpected expenses seem to always come along. After having trouble sleeping for quite a while I slept so well last night. I have been especially stressed out the last couple of months but I’ve really been feeling stressed for much longer as I’ve grappled with making ends meet. So thank you to this marvelous community for rescuing me through both donations and good wishes. My world looks so much brighter today. Even Dixie feels it!
