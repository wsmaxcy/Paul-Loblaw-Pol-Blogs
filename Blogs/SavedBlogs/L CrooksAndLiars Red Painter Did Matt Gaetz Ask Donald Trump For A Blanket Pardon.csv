L, Did Matt Gaetz Ask Donald Trump For A 'Blanket Pardon'?, Red Painter, 04-07-21, Gaetzgate is getting really insane. It was just a week ago that news broke about Matt Gaetz being under investigation for child sex trafficking. Hours later he did a completely insane interview on Tucker Carlson. Just 2 days after that the New York Times published actual receipts showing evidence of payments to women using payment apps. Well today's news is even more nuts. The New York Times is now reporting that in the waning weeks of SeditiousEx's presidency Matt Gaetz asked for a "blanket pardon."!! At the time Gaetz was under investigation for sex trafficking crimes although it was unclear if he knew at the time. But why would a completely innocent person need a "blanket pardon" for any and all federal crimes unless they knew they committed crimes right? Matt Gaetz was one of SeditiousEx's biggest cheerleaders for 4 years. He went to the mat for him at every chance never backed down from a chance to attack the media the Democrats and the "Deep State." But it appears his loyalty did not pay off. The New York Times Reports that "top White House lawyers and officials viewed the request for a pre-emptive pardon as a nonstarter that would set a bad precedent." The added that "Aides told Mr. Trump of the request though it is unclear whether Mr. Gaetz discussed the matter directly with the president. Mr. Trump ultimately pardoned dozens of allies and others in the final months of his presidency highlighting his willingness to wield his power to help close supporters and lash out against the criminal justice system. In recent days some Trump associates have speculated that Mr. Gaetzâ€™s request for a group pardon was an attempt to camouflage his own potential criminal exposure." Sadly for him the pardon was not granted and Gaetz has zero protection from state or federal prosecution. And since news broke last week of the investigation Trump has been shockingly silent.   Loyalty is always a one way street with Donald Trump. Matt Gaetz is learning that the hard way. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
