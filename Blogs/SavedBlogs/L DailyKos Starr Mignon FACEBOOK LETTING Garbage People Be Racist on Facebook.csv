L, FACEBOOK LETTING Garbage People Be Racist on Facebook, Starr Mignon, 2021-04-28, There was once a Group on Facebook called ‘People Being Racist Garbage On Facebook’. This group was meant to help expose racists on the platform and help Facebook do something about this scourge of evil.However the group was constantly filled with screen captures of Facebook notifications responding to reports of racists with a message consisting of ‘This Does Not Violate Our Community Standards’.Facebook left so much racism up on the platform that the admins of ‘People Being Racist Garbage On Facebook’ soon changed the title to ‘FACEBOOK LETTING People Be Racist Garbage On Facebook’. and the group found a new focus in only reporting incidents of Facebook allowing the most vile sickening racist sexist trash  you could ever imagine to remain on their platform.Haley ‘Nazi Barbie’ Adams for just one example who after being banned from Facebook and Twitter dozens of times maintains a Facebook page filled with calls for extermination of ‘brown people’ and numerous group photos of her nazi terror cabal throwing white power hand signs all of which Facebook is just peachy keen with FYI.Eventually the ‘FACEBOOK LETTING People Be Racist Garbage On Facebook’ is noticed by the Facebook staff and that’s when things get really ugly.Facebook has been on a PR campaign of late to try and save their skin and pitch themselves as vigilant in the fight against bigotry. “We stand against racism and in support of the Black community and all those fighting for equality and justice every single day.” says Facebook in official announcements.Why then did Facebook Disable the ‘FACEBOOK LETTING People Be Racist Garbage On Facebook’ group and hit its Admins with 30 day bans for such posts as the screen capture in the header for this story? That is one of the Admins posting racist (most likely fake accounts) sending him private messages filled with sexist harassment and death threats.How exactly does exposing sick sad little bastards using the Facebook platform to send threats of gang rape and murder count as an offensive act to Facebook?And why is Facebook attacking anyone who points out how Facebook is not doing enough to combat hate on its platform?This former employee knows why.www.washingtonpost.com/…“I’m quitting because I can no longer stomach contributing to an organization that is profiting off hate in the US and globally” Chandwaney wrote.Yes hate sells and Facebook is buying. And they don’t take kindly to anyone who is exposing that fact and exposing the PR bullshit they are spewing is just that bullshit. Facebook is going on NPR and any other news outlet that will have them an gaslighting the world about the so called anti-hate stance the have a the company.Chandwaney is just one of THOUSANDS of employees who take issue with how Facebook handles its platform and its response to hate.And this is just one single anti-racist Facebook group with hundreds of members who have now had their exposure of hate silenced by the company while the page admins are silenced across the entire platform.Facebook needs to stop cracking down on citizen volunteers and watchdog groups who are a literal army ready and able to remove 100% of the haters and terrorists on their platform and start hiring them!And bring ‘FACEBOOK LETTING People Be Racist Garbage On Facebook’ back and let the Admins continue their good work. Instead of attacking them give them a reason to change the name of the group back to its original form!
