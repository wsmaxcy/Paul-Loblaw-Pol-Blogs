L, Talking to Police Officers about the culture of their workplaces., Nonlinear, 2021-04-18, Today I am beginning a new series of diaries. They will appear every Sunday. These diaries will discuss my ongoing research into police culture in all its aspects. That will include how it is embedded in and reflects the culture of the communities that are being policed as well as exploring differences in police cultures around the world.  I will be drawing on scientific literature from 1971-2021. However I have also interviewed law enforcement officers agents and administrators both current and former and circulated questionnaires within my personal law enforcement network and my contacts have often chosen to circulate these questionnaires among their networks. Additionally I have interviewed some of the world’s foremost experts on subjects such as sexism and racism in police culture. Invariably I have also looked for connections between police culture and police violence.  I do not claim to be an expert in this field and while I will occasionally be speaking from personal experience or belief mostly my goal is to allow my readers to hear from law enforcement officers in their own words. For example I stumbled on the work of Thomas Owen Baker. You can check him out at www.thomasowenbaker.com or follow him on Twitter @thomasowenbaker.  The article that caught my eye was in The Guardian. It had a very provocative title. As a cop I killed someone. Then I found out it happens more often than we know. Tomorrow I am reaching out to Mr. Baker to try to schedule an interview. My project is ongoing and my conclusions utterly unknown and so every time I find an interesting point of view I reach out to see if we can talk.  The entire article in The Guardian is worth reading but here is a quote that hit home with me because it so perfectly sums up my own research.   I’ve spent the last year reading over 1700 accounts of police-related deaths. There is usually a complex combination of race class guns violence capital and other social forces that lead to the fatal encounter. Merely identifying a handful of bad officers and sending them to prison is not a sufficient solution. We must work toward a society where citizens and their governmental representatives – the police – aren’t so terrified of one another. I would add mental health issues to Mr. Baker’s list but completely agree on the complexity and interconnections that lead to officer involved shootings. Police culture is seldom explored as a factor  in police involved deaths and other acts of police violence. However I will be presenting evidence that police culture including how unions and management contribute to that culture is what I call a predicate factor.  Toxic police cultures allow toxic police officers to act out their worst biases and fantasies. It also stresses out every member of such a force and puts them on edge. A toxic police culture creates the environment in which violence is inevitable. If that culture tolerates or even encourages racism sexism ableism homo and transphobia and classism then that violence will be targeted.  Next Sunday the first full diary in this series “Why police reform fails” will explore the history of attempts at police reform over the last 50 years. Making policing better has often proven to be a very tough nut to crack. And that is a major understatement.   I am somewhat sympathetic towards police officers. I believe that there are quite a number of police officers who are fundamentally good people who are fully committed to doing an extraordinarily hard job well. They are often strident critics (as you will see as we move forward) of their Departments their profession and their colleagues. I am going to spend an entire diary deconstructing the idea of the Blue Line. These officers interfere when they see a fellow officer breaking the law they willing testify against them in court and otherwise try to get rid of bad officers. I am going to present a number of examples of officers doing each of these things.  There are also officers who are sadists fascists socio and psychopaths. In some policing organizations there is evidence these deviant behaviors are selected for starting with the recruiting process. Once hired their bad behaviors aren’t punished and are even encouraged formally or informally. I will be discussing these problems in great detail as well.   The vast majority of officers are somewhere in between. The problem is that the performance of this majority of mediocre officers is dependent on the culture of the force to which they belong. Bad apple barrels create bad apples. Bad police cultures create bad officers.  However I would be remiss if I didn’t also discuss the role that the wider civilian culture’s attitudes toward violence racism sexism and so on have in determining the culture of the police departments that serve each community. Police officers are chosen from within these broader cultures and reflect the beliefs and attitudes of their source culture.  Worse we the collective we expect police officers to deal with problems far beyond their training and expertise. The result is a disaster. “Police whose primary tools are authority and force are tasked with responding to societal problems that they are not equipped to handle from homelessness to mental health to poverty” said John Raphling senior US criminal legal system researcher at Human Rights Watch. “This inevitably leads to unnecessary violent encounters and harms overall safety particularly in Black and brown communities.” In other words cultural assumptions matter. As we are going to see violence drops when either a) these responsibilities are transferred to other agencies or b) police officers are recruited for their training and experience in these areas and provided with ongoing training and support to hone their skills in these areas of policing. Most communities do neither and the reason often comes down to resistance within local police cultures.  We will explore that resistance its causes and expression next Sunday.
