L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: David Eastman- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-05-04, On this date in both 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” profiled David Eastman a current member of the Alaska House of Representatives first elected to office in 2016 after a failed attempt to win a seat on the Alaska State Senate back in 2012. His district is better known as the little Alaskan hamlet known as Wasilla aka the wellspring that gave our nation Sarah Palin. And yeah there might be something in the water in that burg.David Eastman came to our attention here at CSGOPOTD because of the extent of his anti-choice fervor. It isn’t just that this upstart GOP legislator literally compares abortion to slavery and in his one term and change in office Eastman has already become known as the lunatic willing to be the one lone “no” vote on several pieces of bi-partisan legislative ideas including honoring African Americans of the Vietnam War being the lone vote against honoring the African American workers who built the Alaska Highway and he once submitted an amendment to a bill aimed at raising awareness for sexual assault and child abuse that required that abortion would be referred to as a form of “child abuse”.That’s still not all Eastman is really “out there” on abortion. In an interview back in May of 2017 only a few months into his first term in office he gave his opinion that there are women trying to deliberately get pregnant because they can use an abortion as a means to get a “free vacation” to come down to Anchorage:             “You have individuals who are in villages and are glad to be pregnant so that they can have an abortion because there’s a free trip to Anchorage involved. We’ve created an incentive structure where people are now incented to carry their pregnancy longer than they would otherwise and then take part in that when they wouldn’t otherwise be doing it. I can think of a case that was brought to our attention earlier this session where you had a family who was very glad to hear that their abortion had gone beyond a certain point because they were going to be heading to Seattle.”       So that little statement was enough to earn Eastman a censure from at the state legislature and he dug in and refused to apologize for it. Amid the controversy a legislative aide at the capitol who just resembled Eastman died his natural red hair blonde just to avoid catching hell from people who mistook him for Eastman. Alaska Republicans have also come to realize that Eastman is a corruption scandal waiting to happen as by the end of his first term in office he had committed an ethics violation by leaking information from a confidential state report to a reporter as a means of trying to damage a Democratic colleague.We’re wondering how David Eastman’s 2020 election fortunes are going to be as the Alaska GOP is so sick of his s*** they’ve placed him on probation (No word on if it’s “double secret probation” or not) for his inane outbursts and obstruction and have removed him from all roles he plays in committees within the legislature. And yet… Eastman narrowly survived a primary challenger supported by the Alaska GOP in 2020 with 52% of the vote before coasting to victory in November.Eastman however was still aggrieved about the validity of the election he won another term in because Donald Trump did not win another second term to serve as an agent of chaos implanted by the Kremlin to run the United States so he flew all the way from Wasila to Washington DC to be present at the Capitol during the “Stop the Steal” rally that posed as the legitimate face of the violent coup attempt carried out against members of Congress by Trump supporters on January 6th 2021. He had the sheer brass balls to claim that he saw no signs of violence on the rotunda that day.Then again people do seem to be of the opinion that David Eastman’s head is waaaay up his arse so that might explain it.       One Year Ago May 4th 2020: David Eastman (AK)… 2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago May 4th 2019: David Eastman (AK)… Original ProfileThree Years Ago May 4th 2018: Robert Fisher (NH)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago May 4th 2017: Robert Fisher (NH)… Original ProfileFive Years Ago.
