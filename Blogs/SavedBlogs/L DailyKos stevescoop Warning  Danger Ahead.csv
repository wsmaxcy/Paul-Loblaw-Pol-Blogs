L, Warning:  Danger Ahead, stevescoop, 2021-07-01, Carroll G. Robinson is a Texas attorney and professor.  He is also chairman of the Texas Coalition of Black Democrats.  He has asked me to share his opinion on today’s Supreme Court decision gutting a major portion of the Voting Rights Act.  His thoughts follow:  The Republican justices on the United States Supreme Court have just ruled thatRepublican state legislators can discriminate against minority voters but just not toomuch. The Republican justices did not say what would constitute too muchdiscrimination. We can now expect to see a lot more experimentation by Republicanstate legislators when it comes to voter suppression. No amount of voter suppressionwill be too much for many of them. The Court’s decision in the Arizona voting rights cases and the unwillingness of someSenate Democrats in D.C. to amend the filibuster to pass election reform and legislation to strengthen the Votings Rights Act may just be the beginning of the worst still yet tocome. The 1965 Voting Rights Act was enacted into law to help enforce the Civil WarAmendments to The United States Constitution. The purpose of the Voting Rights Actwas to protect the right to vote for Blacks and other people of color as the right to votewas an essential and fundamental part of being a citizen in our nation. In their opinion in the Arizona voting rights cases the Republican justices attempted todisguise their continued subversion of the Voting Rights Act in the argument that allelection laws cause a burden. That may be true but that equal burden is not the burdenthe Voting Rights Act was passed to prevent. The Voting Rights Act was meant toprotect against unequal burdens against voters of color. It was not passed to preventonly extreme burdens on the right of people of color to vote; it was passed to defendagainst all unequal burdens no matter how small. What Republican justices have now done is establish a new and more modern versionof with “all deliberate speed”. Now it’s in the context of voting rights. Now the issue ishow much discrimination is too much? Now the question becomes will the Court applythis new standard in redistricting cases? Watch what’s coming now that Republicans on the United States Supreme Court haveopened this door. There is danger ahead.
