Portland Oregon had its hottest day ever recorded – reaching 108F (42.2C) on Saturday afternoon according to the National Weather Service. The previous record for Oregon’s largest city was 107F (41.7C) a mark hit in 1965 and 1981. Seattle reached 101F (38.3C) by mid-afternoon Saturday making it the hottest June day on record and only the fourth time in recorded history the usually temperate city had topped 100 degrees according to the National Weather Service. It only got to 103F here in Eugene yesterday It’s a good thing that it’s a dry heat. They finally fixed the signal. It didn’t help. I got nothing what’s on your mind today?
