L, NJ & CT-Gov: Democratic Governors Offer Free Beer & Shots To Residents Who Get Vaccinated, poopdogcomedy, 2021-05-04, That’s how you do it:  NEW: We’re launching our “Shot and a Beer” program to encourage eligible New Jerseyans ages 21+ to get vaccinated.Any New Jerseyan who gets their first vaccine dose in the month of May and takes their vaccination card to a participating brewery will receive a free beer. 🍻 pic.twitter.com/REiHTEa6mi  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy is paying for the next round. On Monday Murphy announced the “Shot and a Beer” program designed to incentivize New Jersey residents over 21 who haven’t gotten vaccinated to do so and they’ll be rewarded with a free pint. “Any New Jerseyan who gets their first vaccine dose in the month of May and takes their vaccination card to a participating brewery will receive a free beer” Murphy said in a tweet. So far 13 bars and breweries have signed on to the program with more expected to be added to the list. New Jersey isn’t the only state doing this:  ➡️Visit a participating Connecticut restaurant May 19-31➡️Show your vaccine card➡️Get a free drink (food purchase required)For the list of participating restaurants visit https://t.co/Mtob05qHgIMore will continue to be added over the coming weeks.#CTDrinksOnUs pic.twitter.com/ZO0ue5bBwO  Connecticut is offering its own alcoholic incentive with its “Drinks On Us” campaign: Residents who get fully vaccinated and show their vaccine cards at certain restaurants will score a free drink between May 19 and May 31. Incentive or no vaccine rates are rising. More than 29% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated according to Johns Hopkins University and cases and deaths from Covid are on the decline. But a significant number of Americans say they are not willing to get vaccinated. A Monmouth University poll published in mid-April found that about 1-in-5 Americans say they won’t get the shot. That’s prompting health officials and leaders at every level of government to urge more people to seek out and receive their vaccinations. The “Shot and a Beer” campaign is just one piece of New Jersey’s broader slate of programs aimed at returning the state to a more normal summer as the fight against the pandemic continues. I don’t care what it takes to get more shots in arms but Murphy and Lamont deserve cheers for this. Let’s help them get ready for re-election.
