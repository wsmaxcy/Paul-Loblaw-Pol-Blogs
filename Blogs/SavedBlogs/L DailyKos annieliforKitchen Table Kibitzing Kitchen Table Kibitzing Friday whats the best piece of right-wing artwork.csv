L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing Friday: what's the best piece of right-wing artwork?, annieliforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-07-02,   This was an interesting Twitter question with many interesting replies. What's the best piece of "right-wing" art? (Whatever that means to you)  It’s actually a much more complex question considering that previous guy’s idea of art was either a forged French Impressionist painting or mediocre portraits of himself.  There certainly is fascist art or art that isn’t “degenerate”: hackneyed anti-modern rather than avant-garde modernism. But what of other media artworks. One could argue that the oeuvre of certain film directors represented such sentiments like John Milius as well as some film characters: Iron Man Batman and Cruella. The Fast and the Furious film franchise? Some right-wing artworks act as reactionary answers to what might be intersectional artwork. Then there’s television’s 24 and 30 Rock and the obvious historically actual fascist architecture. It is possible to argue that art is at its best when it is not political except that the George Clooney 2014 movie Monuments Men reminds us that no art can be exempted from politics when property is involved.

It also gets the historical facts almost completely wrong which is important in making it right-wing.   pic.twitter.com/od2aJeZscE  Extremely happy for this question for leading me to this article I am literally laughing out loudhttps://t.co/wnMrXJhnDz 8. Black Panther (on Netflix). The new Black Panther is a rebuke to the old Black Panthers: As played by Chadwick Boseman in Ryan Coogler’s terrifically entertaining and smart blockbuster the titular superhero personifies a vision in which black people work peacefully alongside others to achieve mutual goals. It’s the villain of the piece Michael B. Jordan’s Killmonger who advocates a sinister combination of African separatism and burn-it-down Year One utopianism with chilling echoes of Pol Pot. 3. Little Pink House (for rent via video-on-demand also on Hoopla and Kanopy). If high-school students were required to see this film in classrooms libertarianism would become as popular as Barack Obama. Catherine Keener creates a screen version of Susette Kelo the New London Conn. citizen who didn’t want to relinquish her lovingly painted house to the grasping hands of a government that had decided a property developer should get to bulldoze it. As Antonin Scalia memorably put it when Kelo’s case reached the Supreme Court the government’s absurd position was that “you can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes.” It would be hard to name a better cinematic illustration of the importance of property rights. www.nationalreview.com/... https://t.co/LADQEr7pcy  Renato Giuseppe Bertelli’s portrait of Mussolini “Profilo Continuo”. pic.twitter.com/4Avy245Cec  Then there’s the much more thoughtfully considered responses:  ‘Yes [Prime] Minister’ is the only truly funny conservative comedy made in my lifetime(There are a lot of fascinating replies here) https://t.co/i0w2aN1Ikp   Any Simpsons’ episode written by John Swartzwelder   pic.twitter.com/LgVeRkQUt1  Dont care if it's ironic cracks me up every time pic.twitter.com/WGWZBlOjVh  If you consider auto design art (I do) and if you consider a certain element of its early history reason enough to call it "right wing" (debatable) I submit: pic.twitter.com/vtvaGDE0bQ    Darn food politics:  The Most Conservative Fast Food Joints The regional factor is quite evident again when looking at conservative fast food restaurants. Krystal Whataburger Schlotzky’s and Steak ‘n Shake are all predominantly found in the midwest and southern states. And Chick-Fil-A well… that’s an obvious one:   Not seen on this list was seafood joint Long John Silver’s which only came in as moderately conservative (104) but indexed very below-average for liberals (74). The Most Liberal Fast Food Joints Au Bon Pain came in as overwhelmingly liberal (182 the highest index of all businesses surveyed) and that’s likely because of its concentration in the northeast (and it probably doesn’t help to have a French title). And according to the WSJ Chipotle and Qdoba are apparently telltale signs of the exurbs turning liberal. Blimpie is a somewhat surprising inclusion in the top five; but Starbucks surely is not:   Au Bon Pain was the least conservative fast food establishment also indexing at 74. Chipotle scored a conservative index of 75. Who knew burritos were a more liberal thing? www.mediaite.com/...  www.livescience.com/...
