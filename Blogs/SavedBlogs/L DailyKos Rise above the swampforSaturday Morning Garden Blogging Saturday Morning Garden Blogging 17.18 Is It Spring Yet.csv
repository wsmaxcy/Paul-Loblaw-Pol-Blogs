L, Saturday Morning Garden Blogging 17.18: Is It Spring Yet?, Rise above the swampforSaturday Morning Garden Blogging, 2021-05-01, Reading Saturday Morning Gardening diaries the past month or so reminded me of our trips to Florida during spring break. Spring has been arriving in 2021 diaries starting in Florida Mississippi and the West coast and is gradually moving north with these stories following the sun. We experienced the same phenomenon driving south in 1966. A few months after our dad died our mother decided that we were going to Florida for spring break. Dad left mom with significant debt so we didn’t have much money but mom could budget we had camping gear and lots of motivation to escape winter. Mom and my brother Bill 15 and sister Mary 9 packed the car in western New York picked me up at school in Cortland and we were on our way. Virginia was the first stop - a long haul but Mom and I drove in two-hour shifts and we made it to a campground in the the Blue Ridge mountains.  In the morning we smelled a funky odor and the four of us were squished together on one side of the tent the other side flattened. Our neighbors told us a bear was sleeping on our tent! I guess we were too tired to notice. The next two spring breaks when money wasn't so tight we rented a camper. Before the interstate road system was completed we drove south on U.S. Route 1 a 2-lane sometimes 4-lane road along the Atlantic coast. We observed the local color better here than driving on the interstate highways. When we stopped for gas in Georgia (full-service only in those days) the attendant asked "How's y'all?"  Mom said "We're fine thanks" then she thought for a minute... Did he say "How are you all?"Or "How's your oil?" She quickly changed her reply to "Well maybe you better check it!" We cracked up laughing! That question was our code for everything southern that was new and strange to us Yankees. I inherited the genes that make the women in the family look younger than they really are. I saw it as a disadvantage at the time but almost 60 years later I can admit that it has served me well. But on that trip I went into a store to buy cigarettes. The clerk wouldn't sell them to me. She said she would sell them to my brother (5 1/2 years younger) before she would sell them to me! We made it to Florida and had fun sightseeing and enjoying the warm weather. On the way home the following week we watched the season change back to winter. On the last day of the trip we didn’t have enough money left to stay in a motel. We wanted to push on to get home so we pooled our resources and bought gas and a light supper. We arrived home with 18 cents among us! So much for reminiscing! Let’s talk about gardening! In my last diary I showed how I prepped my garden in the fall using a technique called Lasagna gardening. Today I would like to share how it’s growing and yielding results! Hahaha! I think I’m a little too early! Here’s how the garden looked over the winter.  As you can see in the title photo it snowed a week ago with temperatures in the 20s. But the apple trees garlic rhubarb and horseradish are looking good the daffodils are blooming and the crocuses have already done their thing.  I’m doing a little experiment this year. In two beds I planted seeds of cold weather plants like peas radishes and lettuce by brushing away the mulch and planting the seeds in the trenches. I then covered them with clear plastic containers to protect them from severe cold and the critters that like to eat the seedlings. Later when/if they get bigger I will replace the covers with cheesecloth and side dress them with compost. I spread compost on two other beds to prepare them for planting later when the soil warms up. I also found some seed packets from last year with lavender and chamomile. I started them indoors and they germinated so I will transplant them along the garden fence to encourage the pollinators to visit. This is Zone 5 and last year we had a very late hard frost that wiped out my garden in mid-June. I hope that won’t happen again this year. Happily a friend has a small greenhouse and always starts more plants than she can fit in her garden so she will help me out if necessary. This diary is a little sparse in gardening substance but I hope to be back in July or August and report on how the fruit herbs and vegetables are growing.
