L, Josh Hawley’s ‘Canceled’ Whine Gets Thoroughly Debunked By CNN’s Brianna Keilar, Lee Moran, 2021-05-07, CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Thursday broke down why Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) complaints about being “canceled” are so disingenuous. “Just try to get away from Sen. Hawley. It’s like trying to escape the Kardashians” cracked the “New Day” host. “It’s impossible because he’s everywhere.” Keilar noted that Hawley ― an ally of Donald Trump who supported the ex-president’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election result ―  is on Facebook Twitter YouTube and Instagram and he shows up on Fox News “as often as you brush your teeth.” “And don’t forget as he complains about being silenced he also has a platform so exclusive that only 99 other Americans have access to it — the floor of the United States Senate” she continued. “‘Silenced’ he says. But he’s not and he knows it” Keilar concluded. “He’s a smart man who sees opportunity in acting like a martyr.” Watch the video here:
