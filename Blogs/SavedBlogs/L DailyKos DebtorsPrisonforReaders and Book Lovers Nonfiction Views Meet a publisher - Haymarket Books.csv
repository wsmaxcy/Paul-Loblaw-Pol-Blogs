L, Nonfiction Views: Meet a publisher - Haymarket Books, DebtorsPrisonforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-04-27, For this week’s Nonfiction Views we’re taking a look at a publisher rather than a specific book. It’s something I plan to do periodically and to kick off this series-within-a-series we have Haymarket Books. Haymarket celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. As you might guess from its name they are based in Chicago and take their inspiration from the 1886 Haymarket Affair that essential landmark in U.S. labor politics. Their mission statement is “to publish books that contribute to struggles for social and economic justice including books that wouldn’t necessarily find a home in a more risk-averse publishing world dominated by a few large corporations.” Browsing through their catalog I’m reminded of the days back in the late 1980s/early 1990s when I would attend the annual Socialists Scholars Conference in New York City. In that era the Conference was in its second incarnation having evolved from an earlier more academic and more Communist framework to a Democratic Socialist bent with lots of political panels on every topic. It was at that point the largest gathering of leftists in the country at its peak drawing as many as 2000 attendees from a wide swath of progressive thought. In other words it had the invigorating energy networking opportunities and broad scope of Netroots Nation but the Old Guard was still very much in evidence. There was a lot of dour earnestness and a lot of refighting old ideological battles of Marxism. And so it is with the Haymarket catalog: among their 800 books there are no fewer than 35 books on the Russian Revolution and some 88 titles in the category of Marxism and Socialism. Not that there’s anything wrong with that! Plenty of great books to be found there! But the important question is how well Haymarket has evolved to 1) represent modern leftist thinking on feminism racism Native Americans environmentalism LGBQT+ intersectionality etc. and 2) cut back on the dour earnestness. On the whole I’d say they are doing very well. (I can also report that in person they are not at all dour and earnest as I’ve spoken with their team at book marketing events many times over the years.) Haymarket books are generally serious well-researched and often polemical. You won’t find a lot of humor here but their stable of authors include a number of excellent wordcrafters like Rebecca Solnit (Men Explain Things to Me Whose Story is This among others) Angela Davis (Freedom Is a Constant Struggle and the forthcoming Abolition. Feminism. Now. and Angela Davis: An Autobiography) and Arundhati Roy (Azadi: Freedom. Fascism. Fiction. Capitalism: A Ghost Story Things That Can and Cannot Be Said among others. And while they aren’t the primary publisher of some authors like Noam Chomsky Howard Zinn Naomi Klein and Mike Davis they publish smaller works by those authors. Haymarket also has a vibrant online presence. Their YouTube channel is a cornucopia of streamed talks with authors and experts on every subject imaginable to the progressive movement. They also offer Apple podcasts and are active on Twitter and Instagram. As we well know here on Daily Kos the progressive movement can be a contentious space. Haymarket is active in the Israel/Palestine issue one which can get Kossacks riled up. Indeed their very first book was The Struggle for Palestine a 2002 collection of essays edited by Lance Selfa. Haymarket operates under the umbrella of the Center for Economic Research and Social Change which also runs the Mondoweiss website devoted to “covering American foreign policy in the Middle East chiefly from a progressive Jewish perspective” and the Palestinian Festival of Literature. Haymarket also caught some flak with their recently announced Against Ableism: An Anthology scheduled to be edited by poets Shira Erlichman Ilya Kaminsky and Morgan Parker. Their call for contributions earlier this month sparked some complaints from the disabled community questioning whether “the editors and press have the community and political savvy to engage the vast umbrella of Disability?” Their initial open letter can be read here. Haymarket is working to address their concerns.  The publisher also offers an excellent book club deal: for just thirty dollars per month you get a print and eBook of every one of their new releases as well as 50% off their backlist. Here is a small selection of some of their titles across many categories but go check them out for yourself. (Links as always are to my Literate Lizard website. Your support is appreciated if you don’t already have a favorite indie bookstore and these books are also available directly through Haymarket’s website often with a discount and bundled eBook.)
