L, Officer Sicknick died of natural causes - ME per WAPO, blue aardvark, 2021-04-20, Washington Post Capitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after he confronted rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection the District’s chief medical examiner has ruled. The ruling released Monday will make it difficult for prosecutors to pursue homicide charges in the officer’s death. Two men are accused of assaulting Sicknick by spraying a powerful chemical irritant at him during the siege but prosecutors have not tied that exposure to Sicknick’s death. Also: Diaz said Sicknick suffered two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body. Diaz said he could not comment on whether Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition citing privacy laws. Probably no murder charges for the seditionists of January 6th it appears. Although there is this comment from the ME. Diaz’s ruling does not mean Sicknick was not assaulted or that the violent events at the Capitol did not contribute to his death. The medical examiner noted Sicknick was among the officers who engaged the mob and said “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”
