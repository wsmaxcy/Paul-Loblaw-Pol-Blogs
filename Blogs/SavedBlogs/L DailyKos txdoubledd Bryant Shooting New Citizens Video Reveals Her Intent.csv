L, Bryant Shooting New Citizen's Video Reveals Her Intent, txdoubledd, 2021-04-22, As the trial and conviction of Chauvin showed videos can be the crucial evidence and today we have a new video from across the street revealing a new view with sound.  The neighbor had a video camera that operated from his garage and captured what led up to the shooting. He was outside earlier and heard some of the shouting between the females but then went back in his house and a couple of minutes later he heard the shots.  "In the video Bryant can be heard shouting “I’m gonna stab the f*ck out of you” before she lunges at the girl in pink with what appears to be a knife in her hand. The police officer then fired four shots hitting Bryant."  Snip  The neighbor realized his camera may have caught some of the events so he downloaded it and gave a copy to police.  He was interviewed by local TV.  “From my point of view watching this unfortunately the whole scenario put him in a bad spot” he continued. “He could have either not fired and the young lady in pink could have got stabbed in the neck or fatally injured and then responded and shot and that would have been two young ladies possibly dead. Or he could have responded the way that he did and unfortunately one lady lost her life in the incident that probably could have been avoided.” “The video doesn’t lie” Brinson concluded. “There was an altercation he responded and he reacted with what he thought was his best judgment…He did what he thought was best.”  Myediaite article
