L, Top Comments:  Rocket Through the Past, gizmo59forTop Comments, 2021-06-27, We’re moving across the country next month so over the past two weeks we have been in the process of packing and cleaning in the interest of selling the house and being ready when the moving van shows up.  We managed to fill about ¾ of an extra-large dumpster with the stuff we could clearly identify as trash and there’s still more of it  This process has been more than just physically demanding as objects are either thrown out or packed.  It is also psychically exhausting. Once I finished my degree I spent a decade jumping from position to position while hoping to land a tenure-track position.  Every time I moved my possessions got slightly more scrambled.  Along the way I met hubby and he came along for the ride dragging his possessions with him.  Meanwhile I kept a fair amount of my possessions at my mother’s house so that I wouldn’t have to move them until I settled permanently.  My mother died two years after we bought our first house and all that stuff ended up with us without much in the way of sorting or culling.  That was 14 years ago. Well now I’m in the process of sorting and culling.  While parting with books I’m sure never to read again I’m still keeping way too many of them.  Reviewing all the documents I’ve kept I spent several days reviewing all stages of my education from elementary school through my Ph. D.  I rediscovered my creative writing from high school.  I had forgotten that there was ever such a thing.  I threw out many reams of scientific papers that were no longer relevant to my current research.  On the other hand I am reluctant to throw out floppy disks (both 5.25 in and 3.5 in) with data from experiments performed decades ago.  I have disposed of the records for bank accounts that have not existed for many years at banks that have either collapsed or been acquired by other banks.  I found mementos of events that took some prompting to remember and notes from friends and family sent over the past 40 years.  I sorted through my t-shirts and experienced the same thing all over again.  Many of these are not just clothing but also souvenirs of events and people.  (Big win:  I found my long-lost NN09 t-shirt!)  Then I have to decide whether to keep this stuff or dispose of it.  It’s exhausting. The living room is complete chaos right now but what we had called the “crazy aunt room” (where the door was always kept closed in order to shield guests from the disorder) is now almost clear.  The office also a scene of chaos is nearly clear as well.  We are making progress but it’s a slog.  There is some light at the end of the tunnel but as our house will be listed on July 1 there’s not much more time to clean up this mess.  On the other hand our housekeeper keeps telling us “you don’t have to do anything—the house will sell in one day.”  It’s true the local real estate market like elsewhere is particularly hot right now so I dearly hope this is true. Surviving the coming week is going to be a real challenge. Comments are over the fold but first here’s a word from our sponsor.
