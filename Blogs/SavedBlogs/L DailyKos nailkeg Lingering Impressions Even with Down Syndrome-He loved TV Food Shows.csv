L, Lingering Impressions: Even with Down Syndrome-He loved TV Food Shows, nailkeg, 2021-06-29, If you read my last Lingering Impressions story the job I had of transporting patients ceased to exist.  Still needing work I applied for and was accepted to work in one of the homes for those with developmental disabilities. After a couple of months I was put in charge of a home.  We had 6 patients one woman and 5 men. My job was to be there when they came home from either a daycare center or a makeshift job.  I was responsible for their meals keeping them in clean clothes making sure they took baths and then giving them their medications before bedtime. At the other home I helped with the manager always had an evening meal for them and I decided that I would have a home-cooked meal for my people.  the person who had been in charge before me and the person who worked my day off usually order in fast food. I enjoyed cooking large meals and the group enjoyed them.   There was a wide variety of patients although all were ambulatory.  A couple of the patients were able to hold paying jobs during the day.   To show the extent of diversification one elderly gentleman would sit and read a book after our evening meal.  He would do that after he spent time in his room.  His main chore was keeping his room neat which required a constant rearrangement of his possessions. Of course in the entire time I was there he never turned a page and read the same book every evening. As I mentioned in the previous story most were unable to read at all. After the meal two of the patients would go to their rooms two would sit on the porch which would leave my patient with Down Syndrome. He would lay on the floor and watch TV Food Shows until bedtime.  I asked him if he would like to help me fix our evening meal.  Each evening he would come into the kitchen and I would give him projects to do.  He seemed to really enjoy this time although sometimes it was hard to tell. Unlike many with Down Syndrome he was quiet and slightly aloof. The firm I was working for would once a year have a giant picnic and bring in many of their patients.  As they had around 600 clients in their total program they rented a large park.  Along with the food they had a band which played music. There was little for me to do but observe what was occurring.  I happened to look over at the dance floor and there was my guy with Down Syndrome. He was slow dancing with a girl who also had Down Syndrome. I am sure they probably were able to get together only a couple times a year and I have no idea how they met.  He just tenderly held her close as they shuffled their feet to the music. I don’t think I will ever get the image of them slow dancing out of my memory! Don’t miss my last article  “A Mind Trapped in a Body”
