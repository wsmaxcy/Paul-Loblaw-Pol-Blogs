L, 2020 Minneapolis George Floyd Protest Drone Flight A Bust?, berglandjournalist, 2021-04-20, During the May 29 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis Customs and Border Protection took the unusual step of flying a drone over the city to assist local law enforcement. Curious about what they might have been surveilling I made a Freedom of Information Act request shortly afterward for the drone footage. Not surprisingly during the Trump administration I got crickets save for a couple notifications that the request was bounced around to a couple different offices at the Department of Homeland Security. But a couple days ago I got a notice that my FOIA request was granted in full noting that “CBP has determined the content is approved for release in its entirety no deletions or exemptions have been applied.” CBP uploaded the file to YouTube which can be seen here. Unfortunately those hoping to see zoomed in footage of masses of people and confrontations with police will be sorely disappointed. If indeed this is the complete unredacted footage—you can judge for yourself about that—then it appears the drone flight was largely a bust with no mass protests filmed and whole lotta clouds. There are a few close-ups of people/vehicles that the drone seemed to track in the 72-minute video—most notably around the 57-minute mark—but nothing that my untrained eye could see as especially notable. Those with more experience with these matters or a better grasp of the city of Minneapolis are encouraged to weigh in with any insights.  Still it is concerning that CBP would deploy a drone and it’s worth watching to see if they will do so again if there are protests in the wake of the Chauvin trial verdict.
