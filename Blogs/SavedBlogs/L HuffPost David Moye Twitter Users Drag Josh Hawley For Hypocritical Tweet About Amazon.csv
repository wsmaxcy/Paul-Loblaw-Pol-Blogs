L, Twitter Users Drag Josh Hawley For Hypocritical Tweet About Amazon, David Moye, 2021-05-07, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) interrupted his attacks on “big tech” on Friday in order to ask Twitter users to purchase his new book attacking big tech on Amazon. Hawley’s hypocritical pitch on Twitter came during a press tour promoting the book where he often accuses the mainstream media of silencing him while he’s being interviewed by the mainstream media. Thanks for making The Tyranny of Big Tech a best seller all week on Amazon! You can get your copy here https://t.co/hhFfIdthrY Hawley apparently didn’t see the irony of positioning himself as a big tech foe while using big tech to promote a book that is anti-big tech. Twitter users of course pointed it out to him. Come for the Amazon link stay for the “Twitter for iPhone” source label https://t.co/h9nUs4aiRP Using Twitter to brag about your Amazon sales of a book about how Twitter and Amazon are silencing you is the entire conservative movement boiled down to its essence. https://t.co/OCJi9pR7sz Nothing shows you're being SILENCED while sticking it to big tech like tweeting to your 635000 followers about your book sales on Amazon https://t.co/FAJsDWJTuj Hmm. While promoting a book about Big Tech's "tyranny" Hawley used an Apple product to publish an item on Twitter about his Amazon sales? https://t.co/XnraDtp1ln Capitalists will always sell you the rope you need to hang them. At Amazon they'll even deliver it to your door. https://t.co/vE2Oj3uqpY please buy my book "Stop Eating Meat A Vegetarian's Plea To The World" at Captain J Meat's Meaty Emporium https://t.co/U9K1FrYbg5 Define irony in one tweet https://t.co/qi4U7D3WsO CNN’s Brianna Keilar noted on Thursday that for all of Hawley’s complaints about being silenced by tech companies and the media he’s all over Facebook Twitter YouTube and Instagram and he shows up on Fox News “as often as you brush your teeth.” Last month Hawley was dragged on Twitter after promoting the book as something the “corporate media” and “the woke mob don’t want you to read.” That pitch also included the Amazon link. Though Hawley seems to be having no trouble finding outlets for expressing himself he has faced consequences for promoting Donald Trump’s election lies and raising a fist in support of Capitol rioters on Jan. 6. Simon & Schuster which had been set to publish his book canceled the deal and Lowes Hotel Group dropped plans to hold a fundraiser for him.
