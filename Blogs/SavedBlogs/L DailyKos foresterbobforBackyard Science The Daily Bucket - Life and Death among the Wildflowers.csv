L, The Daily Bucket - Life and Death among the Wildflowers, foresterbobforBackyard Science, 2021-07-04, This story takes place during the Recent Before Times. No I’m not talking about 2019 the era before Covid-19. That’s ancient  history now. Let’s refer to that era as the Archaic Before Times. To anyone in the Northwestern United States or Western Canada there was a time when your home town was never included in sentences containing words such as “115 degrees” or “unprecedented heat.” Birds sang happily gardens grew lush and green and afternoon sunshine was not a thing to be dreaded. Seems like forever but it was only two weeks ago. In the case of this Bucket episode it was the evening of June 19. Among the various wildflowers in bloom were Columbia lilies. Most years I arrive in the Northwest later in the season and the lilies are past their peak. In the cool of the evening (remember cool evenings?) on my way out of the woods I stopped to take pictures of lilies that were conveniently growing next to the road. The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge. We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns spinning around us. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below.  At my second stop I was treated to the sight of a swallowtail butterfly seeming to enjoy a meal of nectar. After taking two pictures I noticed that the butterfly was positioned rather oddly almost as though its wings were stuck in the flower. Drawing closer I realized that I was witnessing Drama in the Deep Dark Woods. Be warned if you don’t like looking at spiders scroll past the next two pictures. Here is a slightly different view zoomed in. The swallowtail was in an odd position for a very good reason. A crab spider lurking among the lily petals had managed to subdue a butterfly many times its size. You’d think that the butterfly would have enough power to escape but the spider has plenty of power of its own packed into that small frame. With that power plus the element of surprise and some potent venom it had turned the swallowtail into dinner.  The next day as I drove along the same road other butterflies flitted from flower to flower oblivious to the fate of their companion. The lead picture was taken in the same patch of lilies as was this one. Here are some more (nonviolent) sights from the forest.     That’s my latest dispatch from the Deep Dark Woods. Tell us what adventures are happening in your part of the world.
