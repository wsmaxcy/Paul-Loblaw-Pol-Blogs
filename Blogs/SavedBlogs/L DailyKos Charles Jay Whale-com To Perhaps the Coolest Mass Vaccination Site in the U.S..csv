L, Whale-com To Perhaps the Coolest Mass Vaccination Site in the U.S., Charles Jay, 2021-04-25,     Whale-com to perhaps the coolest mass vaccination site in the U.S.     The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life at the American Museum of Natural History has been converted into the city’s newest mass COVID-19 vaccination site. New Yorkers can now get their jab right under the iconic 94-foot-long model of the giant blue whale the largest animal  ever to have existed.     The site opened on Friday with the capacity to deliver 1000 vaccinations a day. The site has appointments set aside for residents and staff of city public housing as well as members of the city’s largest public employee union which includes workers at New York City cultural institutions.      But walk-ins are also welcome. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that appointments are no longer mandatory for anyone age 16 and older at any of the coronavirus vaccination sites run by the city including the Museum of Natural History.      It is a far cry from the situation earlier this year when the vaccination roll out got off to a shaky start. Seniors and other eligible New Yorkers faced the daunting challenge of navigating multiple online appointment systems only to see scarce slots filled up within moments. In recent weeks vaccine supplies have increased dramatically.    According to the city’s Vaccine Command Center as of Sunday 51% of all city residents had received at least one dose of the vaccine and 34% have been fully vaccinated.     Mayor Bill de Blasio Rep. Jerry Nadler and Neil deGrasse Tyson were all on hand for the opening as was the costumed Stay at Home Rex bearing the message: “Don’t go extinct get vaccinated.” T-Rex is here at @AMNH to tell people extinction sucks get the vaccine. pic.twitter.com/uQdbho8BcP      Kate-lynn Timmermans inside the T-Rex costume told Spectrum News NY 1:     “Well unfortunately because they didn’t have science back then and there are much improvements the dinosaurs are no longer around so this T-Rex is trying to remind people science is awesome vaccines are awesome and it’ll get us back to normal" said Timmermans who does not work for the museum.      According to the Gothamist website De Blasio said the goal of setting up the vaccination site at the museum was to entice New Yorkers who might be reticent about the vaccine to get their jab at an iconic cultural landmark. Everyone who gets vaccinated under the whale will received a special sticker and a voucher for complimentary museum admission for up to four people.   "Someone said they read about it in the papers and the minute they saw it they said I'm going to go there to get vaccinated" de Blasio said. "The second they saw you could get vaccinated beneath the blue whale they said: 'I'm going to do that. I'm dropping everything."  .  They even got special stickers. The Whale Room is officially the coolest vaxx site in the city. https://t.co/ksKjwHpu2e
