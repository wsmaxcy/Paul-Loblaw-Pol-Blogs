C, The "angry Ikea retail guy" viral montage , Allahpundit, 2021-04-23, To cleanse the palate at the end of a long week. I’m late to these which went viral a few days ago but some of them had me heaving with laughter earlier this afternoon. And not just me: YO!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I’m literally shedding tears right now. https://t.co/peRJNP8Wq1 — LeBron James (@KingJames) April 19 2021  Professional comedians like Patton Oswalt have also shared them. They come from a guy named Scott Seiss who used to work at an Ikea call center in Baltimore handling customer complaints. He did improv and stand-up comedy in his spare time but hadn’t made a name for himself until now playing an angry version of a guy with this old job. I don’t know that this gag would wear well for a 22-minute sitcom but it’s perfection for the TikTok age. And the music which comes from “Bad Girls Club” and functions as a sort of running joke on TikTok in its own right is inspired. Imagining these bits without the melodrama of the soundtrack I think they’d be half as funny. With the soundtrack they’re hysterical. Enjoy.
