L, Odds & Ends: News/Humor (with a "Who Lost the Week?" poll), Ed Tracey, 2021-05-02, I post a weekly diary of historical notes arts & science items foreign news (often receiving little notice in the US) and whimsical pieces from the outside world that I often feature in "Cheers & Jeers". OK you've been warned - here is this week's tomfoolery material that I posted. CHEERS to Bill and Michael in PWM our Laramie Wyoming-based friend Irish Patti and ...... well each of you at Cheers and Jeers. Have a fabulous weekend .... and week ahead. ART NOTES — an archaeological exhibition at the famed Uffizi Gallery in Florence Italy (which opened last November yet had to be closed a day later due to Covid) on the lives of Roman women — from the beginning of the 1st to the second half of the 2nd century AD — has recently been organized virtually through May 9th. YOUR WEEKEND READ #1 is this rather lengthy yet gripping account of the crisis in India by one of its most famed authors and civil rights activists Suzanna Arundhati Roy — how the Modi government coasted on the nation’s early low rates of Covid — and how its indifference to many of its citizens led to today. THURSDAY's CHILD is named Rose the Cat — an English kitteh (named after Billie Piper's character in Doctor Who) who went missing fourteen years ago yet now reunited due to her microchip.  YOUR WEEKEND READ #2 is this account from NPR on how many state foster agencies siphon-off the survivor benefits going to children (based on Social Security contributions from their parent's paychecks) without notice — the result of many states unwilling to spend taxpayer dollars on poor youth — and which led Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) to pass a law as a state legislator to ban the practice. YESTERDAY was the 50th anniversary of the launch of Amtrak — as the national railway was created to relieve the burden of passenger rail from freight railways ... ……. and you just might recognize this long-time rider (who is celebrating). AFTER 100 DAYS the White House has prepared Major the Dog with remedial training … not only about biting but also to see how he would adjust to a new addition to the executive mansion …. and he seems fine with a new cat.  FRIDAY's CHILD is named Jimmy the Cat — an Illinois kitteh with numerous physical ailments who — due to being bathed in his youth (due to incontinence) — has uncommonly taken well to a water-therapy treadmill. THE OTHER NIGHT yours truly hosted the Top Comments diary with a look at Three Moments from FormerGuy that remain in my memory after 100 Days of Sanity — and how two of them are not the most egregious (nor the most substantive) things he did ... yet point to the willingness of others to either fawn over (or exploit) him. BRAIN TEASER — try this Quiz of the Week's News from the BBC ...… and the usually easier non UK-centered New York Times quiz (the first BBC question will help in answering an NYT question). DISTANT COUSINS? —  European travel authority Rick Steves ... and Norwegian conspiracy theorist/Covid-19 denialist Hans Kristian Gaarder .... who recently died from Covid. pic.twitter.com/OK1CLHcfSv  ...... and finally for a song of the week ...........................… not enough time for a full profile ... so I'll close with one of my favorite songs from the past. Written by Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman of The Byrds in 1966 So You Want To Be A Rock 'N' Roll Star was their take on the pop music business of the day (in general) and studio-created bands (such as The Monkees) in particular. With a trumpet solo by the South African musician Hugh Masakela the short song matches its sardonic lyrics with some of Roger McGuinn's twangy guitar licks.   The song has had a notable variety of cover versions: some of the most famous ones include Tom Petty Patti Smith Black Oak Arkansas Bon Jovi as well as Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. But instead I will feature the earliest known cover version of the tune (dating back to 1968) — and quite an energetic one at that. This was by a noted British band which featured Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood (who morphed it into the Electric Light Orchestra later in the 70's). But at the time the music writer Richie Unterberger described them as “The best and most important British group of the late '60s that never made a significant dent in the American market” when they were simply named …. The Move.  Then it's time to go downtownWhere the agent man won't let you downSell your soul to the companyWho are waiting there to sell plastic wareAnd in a week or twoIf you make the chartsThe girls'll tear you apart The price you paidfor your riches and fameWas it all a strange game?You're a little insane The money the fameand the public acclaimDon't forget who you areYou're a rock and roll star!
