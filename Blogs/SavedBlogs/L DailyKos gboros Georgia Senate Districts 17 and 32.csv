L, Georgia Senate Districts 17 and 32, gboros, 2021-04-28, Today I am going be looking at two districts in the Georgia State Senate: SD 17 and SD 32 two Republican held districts that Joe Biden narrowly carried.  Both of these senate districts are located in the greater Atlanta metro area with SD 32 being located at the northern end of the metro and SD 17 being located at the southern end of the metro. These districts have historically been reliably Republican but are rapidly trending towards the Democrats. In particular SD 32 swung about 19 points towards the Democrats in 2016 as the district supported Mitt Romney by about a 35-point margin but supported Donald Trump by a considerably narrower 14-point margin. SD 17 experienced a smaller leftward shift with Trump carrying the district by a little less than 16 points after Romney carried it by 22 points four years earlier. The Democrats made even more progress in the 2018 Governor’s Race with Stacey Abrams coming within single digits of carrying both districts as she lost SD 17 by about 6.5 points and lost SD 32 by about 9 points. Interestingly Abrams outperformed Clinton by quite a bit more in SD 17 (where she outran Clinton by about 9 points) than in SD 32 (where she outran Clinton by about 5 points). The Dems made even further improvements in 2020 with Biden carrying SD 17 by about a percentage point and SD 32 by less than a percentage point.  The State Senate races for these two districts (from the last two election cycles) are also worth discussing. Neither district was all that competitive in 2018. In SD 32 Republican incumbent Kay Kirkpatrick defeated Democrat Christine Triebsch by about 14 points and in SD 17 Republican incumbent Brian Strickland defeated Democrat Phyllis Hatcher by 9 points. The 2020 State Senate races for both districts were improvements for Democrats: substantial in the case of SD 17 where Democrat Kelly Rose came within 2 points of defeating Strickland (performing over 7 points better than Hatcher did in 2018) and smaller in the case of SD 32 where Triebsch lost to Kirkpatrick by about 12 points in a rematch (improving on her 2018 margin by 2 points). Note that while Rose and Triebsch both underperformed Biden (in their respective districts in 2020) Triebsch’s underperformance in SD 32 was considerably greater given that she ran behind Biden by double-digits in contrast to Rose who only did about 3 points worse than Biden. This phenomenon was also true to a lesser extent in 2018 in which Hatcher underperformed Abrams by about 3 points while Triebsch underperformed Abrams by a larger 6 point-margin. It’s also interesting to note that SD 17 and SD 32 have considerably different demographics. SD 17 is a much more diverse district with African Americans making up about 36% of the district’s population and Non-Hispanic Whites making up just slightly over half (around 55%) of the district’s population. This contrasts with SD 32 which is over 72% Non-Hispanic White. SD 32 is also a much more educated and affluent than SD 17. College-educated individuals (those with a bachelor’s degree or higher) make up about 63% of SD 32’s total population but just 26% of SD 17’s total population and SD 32 has a much greater proportion of individuals who make over $75K. (50% vs 23%) Essentially these two districts are likely trending blue for largely different reasons. It seems like much of the Dems’ gains in SD 32 come from college-educated voters while the Dems’ gains in SD 17 are more of a function of the changing demographics in the district. (For example African Americans made up about just 30% of SD 17’s population in 2010 so the district is diversifying.) These differences help explain why the Dems have made so much more progress down-ballot in SD 17 than in SD 32.  A lot of the voters in SD 32 who don’t like Trump may still be inclined to vote Republican down-ballot due to fiscal issues such as higher taxes (which could be particularly relevant given how affluent the district is) as well as general habit (these voters haven’t gotten used to the idea of voting Democrat.) This is likely less true of SD 17 (as African Americans are generally been reliably Democratic voters). The fact that SD 32 also saw considerably more ticket-splitting (in favor of Republicans down-ballot) in 2020 (than in 2018) makes sense as well. A lot of Biden’s gains in the district seem to come from traditionally Republican leaning voters so perhaps a lot of them simply voted straight Republican in 2018 (in contrast to 2020 when they split the ticket and voted for Biden). Thanks to U.S. Census Bureau Daily Kos Elections (for the 2012 2016 and 2018 calculations) and VEST/DRA 2020/Drew Savicki (for the 2020 calculations which were posted on the cnanlysis website.)
