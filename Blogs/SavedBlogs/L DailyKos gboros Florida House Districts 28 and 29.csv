L, Florida House Districts 28 and 29, gboros, 2021-04-21, Today I am going to be looking at two neighboring districts in the Florida State House: HD 28 and 29 which are located in Seminole County (a suburb of Orlando). Both HD 28 and HD 29 have been heavily trending towards the Democrats. HD 28 went from supporting Mitt Romney by just under 7 points to supporting Donald Trump by around 3.5 points four years later. HD 29 experienced an even greater swing to the left in 2016 (than HD 29) with Trump carrying the district by just over 4 points after Romney previously carried it by a little more than 10 points (making it a redder district to begin with). In many ways the Democrats made even further progress in these districts in the 2018 midterms with the FL statewide Dems doing slightly better in HD 28 than in HD 29. In particular Bill Nelson (in the FL U.S. Senate Race) narrowly carried HD 28 by less than a percentage point and Andrew Gillum (in the FL Governor’s Race) narrowly lost the district by less than a percentage point. (For comparison Nelson and Gillum both lost HD 29 by between 1 and 2 percentage points.) However in 2020 Joe Biden performed slightly better in HD 29 than in HD 28 carrying the former district by less than 300 votes but losing the latter district by less than 100 votes (within a percentage point in both cases). The fact that the 2018 FL statewide Democrats performed a bit better in HD 28 (than in HD 29) but Biden performed a bit better in HD 29 (than in HD 28) does not seem that surprising given that 2018 statewide Democrats often performed (relatively) better in places that weren’t as red to begin with (like HD 28) while Biden often performed better in places that were trending blue faster even if those places were redder to start with (like HD 29). The recent state house races for these districts are also worth discussing as well. Both of these seats featured close state house races in 2018 with Republican David Smith winning the open race for HD 28 by a little less than 3 points and Republican Scott Plakon winning reelection for HD 29 by 2 points. It’s interesting that the 2018 state house Democrats performed slightly better in HD 29 given that the opposite was true for the 2018 statewide Democrats and that HD 28 was an open seat (unlike HD 29 where the Republicans had the advantage of incumbency). Perhaps Plakon is a weaker candidate than Smith. It may be worthwhile to note that HD 29 narrowly flipped to the Democrats in 2012 (when the district’s current boundaries were put into place) though this was most likely due to the then incumbent Republican having a financial/ethics scandal. (The district flipped back to the Republicans in 2014 with Plakon winning by double-digits.) The 2020 state house races for these districts were also fairly close (though not as close as they were in 2018) with Smith winning reelection by about 6 points and Plakon winning reelection by about 4 points. The implications of redistricting (with regards to HD 28 and HD 29) are also worthwhile to discuss. Given that Republicans have full control of the FL state government they will likely try to gerrymander again for the next cycle. While gerrymandering should be prohibited in FL due to a ballot-initiative that was successfully passed in 2010 this didn’t stop the Republicans from drawing gerrymandered congressional and legislative maps for the 2012 redistricting cycle. The congressional and state senate maps were struck down by the FL Supreme Court (which had a Dem majority at the time) mid-decade and fairer congressional and state senate maps were put into place starting with the 2016 election. (From my understanding the FL state house maps were never redrawn because no one ever questioned their constitutionality.) Since Republicans control the FL Supreme Court now it seems fairly likely that the anti-gerrymandering requirements will be ignored. While the current incarnations of HD 28 and HD 29 are benefiting Republicans at the moment (since they have managed to hold both districts) this could backfire for them in future. If (for the next redistricting cycle) Republicans choose to keep the boundaries of these districts similar to the current incarnations they run the risk of losing both of them sometime in the future given that both of the districts have been trending towards the Democrats. Therefore it might be smarter for the Republicans to make one of the districts significantly redder and the other bluer (with the latter district being a Democratic “vote sink” from the GOP’s perspective). Currently most of the Democratic strength in both districts comes from the community of Sanford which is split between the two districts. Consolidating Sanford into just one district would be an easy way of making one of the two districts bluer. This is good news for Democrats regardless since it gives them a fairly easy pick-up opportunity now (if the districts are redrawn in the way I proposed) or potentially two in the distant future (if the current boundaries more or less remain intact and the Democrats continue to do well/make progress in the suburbs).
