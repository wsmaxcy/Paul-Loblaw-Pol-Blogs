L, India's Health Care System Is Collapsing As COVID Infections Spike Upwards. Resources Beyond Scare, Seashells, 2021-04-25, India has it’s own mutation of the COVID virus and the number of infected has spiked upwards far enough to cause the country’s health care system to start collapsing. Resources are hard to come by. It isn’t just vents but liquid O2 COVID tests and Rx drugs of all types. The black market is where people have to try and get supplies. Even once they are lucky enough to get admitted into hospitals. And as this is all happening Twitter/Social Media is beginning to get flooded with pro-Modi trolls blaming every one and every thing else but the crappy failed leadership in India. There are several journalistic pieces I link to below. The last is from someone apparently reporting from within India and is not verified in any way. But considering how fast and furious social media is getting rightwing apologists more interested in shifting blame from Modi than solving the dire problem indicates it is an accurate portrayal of how badly the health care system in India is crumbling. Please remember it is not the per capita numbers of new COVID cases… it’s the number of infected versus the number the country’s health care system can adequately treat. BBC journalist Yogita Limaye reports from a Delhi hospital overwhelmed by coronavirus. "There are next to no ICU beds [left] in a city of 20 million" pic.twitter.com/ts0WfPhm9l  https://t.co/FcLfmGAXkQ [6:00min] People struggling to dispose of their loved ones & no knowledge of how to do so - shocking & heartbreaking  Delhi's #JaipurGoldenHospital issues another desperate appeal:Next impending #OxygenCrises in Jaipur Golden Hospital. Over 200 lives at stake if liquid medical oxygen is not supplied by 9 PM tonightEarlier 20 #COVID19 patients had died amid #OxygenShortage in the hospital pic.twitter.com/qPliI7XKKN  On the Virus front:- daily case count breaking old records everyday-very high & CLIMBING positivity ratio -mutating into a super deadly strain that affects hitherto safer section of population (young peple) & spreading exponentially faster than past strains-worsened symptoms  On the resource front (major cities):Absolutely nothing is available w/o deep research & reaching out 100s of leads-100% occupancy in ICU beds with very high number of waitlist patients waiting outside in ambulances. The demand remains higher than supply at all times.  - Most non ICU available beds are w/o oxygen (O2) or ventilators- people forced to secure and administer O2 at home- Which can be administered either through a Concentrator or Cylinder with Flowmeter- Concentrator are extremely scarce. Being sold for upto 90k (100% premium)  - People waiting for hours in queue for procurement & refilling- O2 demand up over 100% & supply falling (atleast in Delhi)Battle on both fronts- The biggest hospitals are begging for O2. Using social media to amplify their requestsCOURTS HAVE TO INTERVENE TO GET THEM SUPPLY  - Commonly prescribed drugs are all out of stock in hospitals.-Only way to get them is to either: Pay 10x markup for illegal suppliesorTo wait in lines in early morning with exhaustive paperwork at select locations in the entire state who run out of them in hours  -The cost of the things that are hard to replenish/produce quickly is rising everyday obviously- PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO GET TESTEDThe testing centres (Pvt and state) are overwhelmed by the demand.Long waiting & delays in bookings & results.-Labs halting home collection  - People pulling strings and trading favors just to get tested.- Mind you testing positive is mandatory to qualify for hospital admissions and medicine equipment procurement legally. - In a race against time the system is forcing one to waste it. Literally killing people  - Dedicated covid hospitals despite physically bad conditions are refusing to admit patients without confirmed test reports (which are super delayed)- Even if they admit they are telling people to procure essential life saving drugs and O2 themselves.
