L, Florida Police State, JoeTheVoter, 2021-05-09, As a long time resident of FloriaDUH I am more shocked than ever at the absolutely authoritarian bigoted takeover of our society by our state’s GOP led legislature and governor DeSantis ( DeSatan ) One of the most heinous acts of late is the cruel unwarranted attack on our own children. Contrast that with their love affair with Covid denial. Even as GOP here declare it illegal for business and schools to ask for proof your vaccinated against carrying a potentially deadly disease they demand school children must display their genitalia in order to qualify to play school sports. Mind you...public schools are government entities and constitutionally bound to adhere to our constitution with regard to equal protection of the law.  Would this not mean that this new law must now apply to every child who wishes to participate in a school-sponsored sport. First step in tryouts...drop your pants!  ( Oh parent’s don’t you dare protest because some nutjob can now run you down with their car if you do.  And don’t try to vote them out because DeSantis just too what he described as the gold standard for elections and broke that too...) I would love it if parents and kids simply boycotted all school sports. No tryouts no games. Organize your own teams on private property out of reach of the crotch cops.
