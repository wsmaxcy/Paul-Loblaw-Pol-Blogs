L, Sunday Pundit Round-up: Vaccine Diplomacy, Chitown Kev, 2021-04-25, Good morning everyone! Dan Balz Scott Clement and Emily Guskin of the Washington Post have some analysis of a new ABC/Washington Post poll that shows President Biden’s job approval ratings at 52% approve/42% disapprove. Overall 52 percent of adults say they approve of the job Biden is doing compared with 42 percent who disapprove. At this point in his presidency four years ago Trump’s rating was nearly the reverse with approval at 42 percent and disapproval at 53 percent. Overall 34 percent of Americans say they strongly approve of Biden’s performance compared with 35 percent who strongly disapprove. Biden receives the highest marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic with 64 percent of adults — including 33 percent of Republicans — giving him positive ratings. His approval rating for his handling of the economy stands at 52 percent. But 53 percent say they disapprove of the way he has dealt with the immigration situation at the U.S.-Mexico border a problem that has vexed his administration for much of its first months. Although his first sizable initiatives enjoy majority support the poll also finds that by 2 to 1 Americans say that Biden should be willing to make “major changes” to his proposals to win Republican support rather than trying to enact proposals without making major changes and getting no backing from congressional Republicans. OK let me say this loud enough for the rooftop seats on Waveland Avenue across the street from Wrigley Field so that it can be heard (and those seats aren’t cheap!). The GQP has no desire or intention to compromise with President Biden on anything no matter President Biden’s willingness to do so; that much is painfully obvious even to a casual observer. Given those circumstances it is unfair ludicrous and ultimately self-defeating (and perhaps delusional) for that segment of the “American people” to hold Joe Biden to that standard. Tim Arango John Eligon and Shaila Dewan of the New York Times have a provocative but plainly correct thesis about the Derek Chauvin trial. For generations the American criminal justice system has operated by an old playbook in cases of police violence. The backgrounds of victims are placed under a microscope. Prosecutors deciding whether to bring charges against officers parse every misstep from victims’ past as do defense lawyers in the rare instances that officers are charged. There was the Laquan McDonald case in Chicago where the defense tried to get the victim’s own mother to testify that he had a violent past. In Kenosha Wis. a prosecutor focused in part on Jacob Blake’s past domestic abuse cases in explaining why no charges were filed against the officer who shot him. The Chauvin trial flipped the script. Mr. Floyd who had moved to Minneapolis for a fresh start became a three-dimensional character. Mr. Chauvin who declined to take the stand remained an aloof figure shown on video kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nine and a half minutes with such sang-froid that his sunglasses never lost their perch atop his head. He likely faces between 12.5 and 30 years in prison when he is sentenced in June. “I don’t think he comes across as like a likable kind of guy” Lisa Christensen an alternate juror in the trial said about Mr. Chauvin. “I didn’t get any vibes from him like he was sorry. It was just cold like a cold feeling.” Yes the concrete evidence of the video was probably too overpowering to prevent a conviction in this case. It’s also true that Derek Chauvin (and his lawyers) did not come across as “likable” in the courtroom. And I think that had an impact. Question for the SPR legal eagles: even in a trial such as the Chauvin trial and...just generally what impact does “likability” have in cases generally (well leaving the Lizzie Borden case aside)? And perhaps specifically in the Chauvin trial. Jeannie Suk Gersen of the New Yorker says that in a way the juries in the Chauvin trial worked pretty much as designed.  The jury trial as we know it evolved from a medieval English practice in which jurors were people in the neighborhood who were already familiar with the parties or the events at issue. They were chosen precisely because they represented the local community’s knowledge of the case. Today a “jury of one’s peers” consists of fellow-citizens whom we instead ask ideally to serve as blank slates: they are chosen for their lack of connection to the events and the ability to put prior views and influences aside in examining the evidence that is presented and sometimes even dramatized at trial. On Tuesday after ten hours of deliberation over the course of two days a Minneapolis jury found the former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter for killing George Floyd last May. In many ways it was a conventional trial in which eyewitnesses testified and experts weighed in on the disputed facts. Yet it called to mind a bygone mode in which the jury’s role was grounded in the act of witnessing. *** Wittingly or unwittingly the prosecution alluded to the medieval role of the juror. The prosecution’s closing statement compared the crowd of bystanders—“people from the community randomly chosen by fate” as witnesses—to the jurors in this case who were “randomly selected people from the community” who “got a summons in the mail.” The bystanders’ bearing of witness exemplified by Frazier’s video enabled the jurors to bear witness too. “The bystanders who were at the scene looked for themselves and it was plain to them” the prosecuting attorney Steve Schleicher said. “They took video. You saw it. It was plain to you.” The bystanders were powerless to stop the killing but the jurors had the power to affirm what the witnesses allowed them to see with their own eyes. Erwin Chermerinsky writes for the Chicago Tribune that it is time for a massive scale federal intervention into the operations of police departments. The reality is that it is very difficult for cities to reform their own police departments. Their instinctive reaction is defensive even in response to egregious police misconduct like Derek Chauvin’s killing of George Floyd. The first statement put out by the Minneapolis police the day after Floyd’s death was not about the need to investigate. Instead it said “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction” suggesting that nothing happened between Floyd’s arrest and his transport to the hospital. Police unions often exercise significant political influence and are obstacles to major changes. High-profile instances of police abuse might trigger efforts at reform but as public attention wanes reform efforts fade as well. That’s why using federal authority to compel reforms in police departments is critical. The Justice Department can sue local and state governments if there is a pattern of constitutional violations and seek appropriate remedies. In most instances the department’s investigation forces cities to enter into a settlement and a consent decree without going through protracted litigation. Jeff Sessions former attorney general in the Trump administration however essentially banned the use of consent decrees saying they harmed police morale. Renée Graham of the Boston Globe strongly suggests that former President George W. Bush should have kept quiet. With a dismal 22 percent approval rating trailing him like a piece of toilet paper stuck to his heel Bush left the White House in 2009. He was widely considered one of the worst presidents in American history. If you’ve watched any of his recent interviews you’d never know it. While promoting his new book of oil paintings Bush has been asked about Derek Chauvin’s trial the current state of the Republican Party and what he thinks about President Biden’s plan to withdraw all American forces from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. He’s now treated like an elder statesman whose sage observations might teach us something about the mysterious ways of the world. Yet the only lesson I see is a very old one: More often than not America forgives and forgets the sins of powerful white men. This is why Bush gets to spend more time talking about his retirement hobbies than his administration’s torture of Iraqis at Abu Ghraib prison. When he recently gave Norah O’Donnell the “CBS Evening News” anchor a tour of his Texas ranch they chatted about his tree farm his art studio and how Congress’s failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform remains one of the biggest disappointments of his presidency. Rebecca Robbins of the New York Times reports that millions of Americans are skipping out on second dosages of the Moderna/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. More than five million people or nearly 8 percent of those who got a first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines have missed their second doses according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is more than double the rate among people who got inoculated in the first several weeks of the nationwide vaccine campaign. Even as the country wrestles with the problem of millions of people who are wary about getting vaccinated at all local health authorities are confronting an emerging challenge of ensuring that those who do get inoculated are doing so fully. The reasons vary for why people are missing their second shots. In interviews some said they feared the side effects which can include flulike symptoms. Others said they felt that they were sufficiently protected with a single shot.  Harvard University’s Pershing Square Professor of Global Health Vikram Patel writes for Indian Express about the “unimaginable horrors” of the COVID 19 pandemic in India right now. No matter what the final analysis of this second wave of the epidemic will tell us we now bear witness to unimaginable horrors unfolding across the country. It is harrowing to witness the phenomenal gains India had made in securing control over the first wave being totally squandered leaving one with the gnawing feeling that we have learned nothing. How else can any of us explain the sheer madness of proceeding with elections and monumental religious gatherings in the midst of a deadly surge. Now as the tsunami sweeps across the land there is little we can do to stem its tide other than adhering to the behaviours we have long known and often neglected. You know the drill but it still bears repeating: Wear a correctly fitted mask avoid crowded situations and get vaccinated. If we must close sectors of our society down we must do so thoughtfully to avoid the horrors which accompanied the first lockdown. And we might begin with doing away with the term “lockdown” itself as awful as the equally terrifying term “social distancing” and request our fellow citizens to “stay at home”. But this sleight of words doesn’t alter the fact that this policy will have a devastating effect on many groups in our country. Foremost on this list are the hundreds of millions of people who rely on daily wages to put food on the table. For many of these people who had just begun to see a light at the end of the dark tunnel as their livelihoods picked up with the decline of the first wave the return of the epidemic may well be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. We must remember that “deaths of despair” led to an unprecedented reduction in the life expectancy of working-age Americans after the financial crisis of 2008; the crisis facing India looks infinitely more daunting. Next on the list are our children who have not seen the inside of a school for a year and who had ached to return to the comfort of a place where they would play meet friends learn and eat a nutritious meal. The damage that school and college closures have played on the learning potential and mental health of this generation is incalculable for the impacts will only become visible in the years ahead. Third we must attend to the needs of mothers and people who struggle with other diseases to avert adding to the mounting Covid-related mortality due to reduced access to essential health care. I agree with Mr. Patel that the term “social distancing” is at best an awkward term.  In that light I should also note that Mr. Patel’s specialty is in mental health so he is eminently qualified to assess the mental and social impacts of usage of the terminology. Josh Rogin writes for the Washington Post about Chinese efforts with “vaccine diplomacy” in Latin America. “Covid was like a perfect storm on the hemisphere” Navy Adm. Craig S. Faller the head of U.S. Southern Command testified last month. “And more needs to be done. This has opened a door for China and Russia to a lesser extent. We see it in their . . . heavy-handed vaccine diplomacy.” In Paraguay the government is under intense political pressure to drop its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan Beijing’s price for providing shots. Latin American countries that recently dumped Taiwan are already getting deliveries. The Brazilian government is rescinding its rejection of Chinese telecom giant Huawei as part of its pitch to Beijing for vaccine help. Faller called for a “whole of government effort” to help Latin American countries resist these moves once Americans are vaccinated. “We’re seeing it play out” he said. “We need to stay on the field.” Ebony M. Coleman Brian Gray and Smriti Bhotika write for Science & Diplomacy on the importance of the Biden Administration to further engage in global health diplomacy. Being the largest funder and implementer of health programs around the globe the U.S. is uniquely positioned to use diplomacy to drive advancement in global health but only if a comprehensive and holistic approach is adopted whereby diplomacy is coupled with other societal responses. Racism distrust in government and other systemic issues have time and again thwarted progress toward improved health outcomes for all. They must be addressed. Predictably these issues have made a robust domestic national response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic much more difficult. If the U.S. intends to play a significant role in shaping the future of global health it must strategically integrate diplomacy into various dimensions of global health initiatives to achieve broad-ranging impact. Global health diplomacy goes beyond interactions among nation-states to achieve public health goals. It can be leveraged to facilitate identification of shared interests and enhance collaboration across many sectors for instance in public-private partnerships. Public-private partnerships can involve an array of partners from academia non-governmental organizations non-profit organizations industry and government and intergovernmental agencies. Partnerships capable of pooling resources and assets such as capital logistics infrastructure communications platforms and international collaborations are essential for meeting future global health challenges. Combining the reach and scale of the public sector with the strengths of the private sector enables the rapid development and deployment of novel treatments and therapies for infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Leslie Roberts of Nature writes that the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impeded progress in the global fight against other diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted prevention and treatment of a host of diseases. As countries went into lockdown last year mass vaccination campaigns for measles polio meningitis and more ground to a halt leaving millions of children at increased risk of deadly preventable diseases. Some health facilities were closed; health-care workers were redeployed to fight the pandemic. Shipments of essential medicines and devices were delayed and fewer people than usual sought treatment at clinics for fear of catching COVID-19. More than a year into the pandemic analysts are trying to gauge its impact on diseases that have largely slipped from public attention. For many diseases it is too soon to see direct increases in illness and deaths so researchers must rely on indirect measures — such as the number of children who have not been vaccinated or falls in diagnoses — or on models which are imperfect tools at best. Together the data suggest that the knock-on effects of the pandemic could be larger than those caused by COVID-19 itself — and that they will linger long after the pandemic has ended. The ramifications can be seen all over the globe but the greatest effects will be felt in some of the poorest most vulnerable countries where health systems are already fragile. Three diseases typify COVID-19’s worrying impacts: TB the biggest killer among all infectious diseases especially among poor and marginalized people; measles one of the most contagious viruses known which is a major killer of young children in poor countries; and polio the only virus currently targeted for eradication which is clinging on in some parts of the world. Everyone have a good morning!
