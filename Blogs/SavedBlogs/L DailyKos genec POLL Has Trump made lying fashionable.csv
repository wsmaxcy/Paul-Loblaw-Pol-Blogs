L, POLL: Has Trump made lying fashionable?, genec, 2021-05-10, Trump has achieved great wealth power and fame in life through the use of massive amounts of lying. Since wealth power and fame are characteristics that many people find attractive has Trump made lying more popular? We are witnessing an entire political party in the United States supporting his “Big Lie” and who are now seriously considering ousting Liz Cheney who chooses to tell the truth rather than go along with the Big Lie. How will this negative behavior translate into the general population? Will children who see their parents support for Trump a license to lie as well? Trump may not be President anymore but his cultural influence is powerful as bad as that may be.
