L, Minerva @ Midnight: Summer augurs a continuation of bad faith and disinformation, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-04-18, Minnesota law enforcement at its based level exhibits some intersectional issues often represented in fictional culture products like Fargo. Their police forces haven’t learned very much since the death of George Floyd. So many examples of bad faith below: Daunte Wright George Floyd Philando Castile. Why do Minnesota police keep killing Black men? https://t.co/BWRsDwRZRg  CNN producer Carolyn Sung was wrongfully arrested by Minnesota state troopers on Tuesday night.

I had cameras & my press credentials clearly in view. It came from the side w/o warning I was shooting so I didn’t even see it coming.

Sputnik has been accused by intelligence services of contributing to Russia’s efforts to interfere in American elections.”  NEW: Staffers at One America News the misinformation-peddling outlet favored by Trump don’t think their own stories are true & are cheering on lawsuits against the owners.

Not joking about this.@apple’s new @AppleArcade game is about a bunch of (overwhelmingly) white people coming together to stop a new housing development in their upper middle class neighborhood because their cats play on the lot.

Some of their worries are fed by misinformation - which is generally purveyed through informal networks like chat groups and friends. Researchers have noted that some of this false information is shared within closed networks out of genuine concern or a lack of knowledge. On-the-ground engagement and campaigns to address doubts they may have are necessary and helpful in assuaging these worries. Public education on sifting out dubious information may also help people be more discerning of what they read. [...] While misinformation refers to information that is false or out of context disinformation is a subset of misinformation that is deliberately created or spread with the intent to mislead. Observers note that these anti-vaxxers spend a disproportionate amount of time online and on social media where they imbibe material that reinforces their beliefs generally along these lines: Covid-19 is not dangerous; Covid-19 vaccines are dangerous; scientists (and governments) cannot be trusted. What is particularly disturbing is that most of this disinformation can be traced back to - and appears to be deliberately manufactured by - a small group of anti-vaccine activists aided by social media platforms and their algorithms that amplify viral content. Recent reports by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) a think-tank based in Britain and the United States focusing on disinformation efforts shed some light on this industry that has enabled anti-vaccine activists on Facebook YouTube Instagram and Twitter to reach over 59 million followers. www.straitstimes.com/...

A pernicious bit of NIMBY intolerance is embedded in the same disinformation that Tucker Carlson is spreading who undoubtedly got the vaccine but is telling his audience it might not work. His cluelessness about the necessity for boosters given the mutations coming from the spread makes his lies dangerous.  Tucker Carlson Insists Every White Supremacist In America Could Fit In Stadium But That Tickets To TuckerCon Won’t Last https://t.co/h69rM4Luur pic.twitter.com/7FAjS4tKi6    Tucker Carlson Falsely Suggests Pfizer Admitted Its Vaccine ‘Doesn’t Work’ https://t.co/ghOIiTp6Wb pic.twitter.com/twXTgC7LaB  Tucker Carlson drew controversy earlier this week when he questioned whether Covid-19 vaccines are ineffective and on Thursday he claimed to viewers that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla had offered up proof Pfizer’s vaccine dosage “doesn’t work” earlier in the day — in reality Bourla was just discussing longstanding plans for booster shots. Carlson has repeatedly used his show to insinuate public health officials are withholding information about coronavirus vaccines and trying to coerce unwilling patients into getting vaccinated. On Monday he floated — but did not outright endorse — a new evidence-free theory: Health experts want people to keep socially distancing after getting vaccinated because they secretly know vaccines are ineffective. “Maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that” he said. https://t.co/ghOIiTp6Wb?amp=1  These Fox News sponsors: They are lying.
