He has rejected calls to tone down his rhetoric even in the wake of explosive devices being sent to CNN and prominent Democrats he has criticized. thehill.com — Apr 05 2019 With “friends” like these … it’s only “Democracy” that is hanging in the balance. President Donald Trump on Thursday called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger an "enemy of the people" as he continued to push baseless claims to explain his loss in the battleground state to Joe Biden. Speaking with reporters the outgoing president accused Raffensperger without evidence of making some kind of "deal" with the Democrat Stacey Abrams to allow vote harvesting in Georgia and said the state had a "fraudulent system." "You're not allowed to harvest but I understand the secretary of state who is really an enemy of the people the secretary of state and whether he's Republican or not this man what he's done supposedly he made a deal and you'll have to check this where she is allowed to harvest but in other areas they're not allowed" Trump said. Abrams has been credited with helping register 800000 people to vote in Georgia for the 2020 election but that is not the same as ballot harvesting in which a voter completes an absentee ballot and gives it to another person to hand in to a polling station. www.businessinsider.com — Nov 27 2020 With “fools” like these … One-third of Americans say that the media is the "enemy of the people" echoing a sentiment frequently expressed by President Donald Trump. A Hill-Harris X poll found that 33% of Americans hold the belief of the news media while 67% believe the media is an important part of democracy. [...] The poll released Monday found that the sentiment is strongest among Republicans with 51% agreeing that media are the enemy. Just 14% of Democrats say the same.

Forty-two percent of people with less than a high school education compared to 31% of people with more than a bachelor's degree say the media is an enemy. Additionally people who live in urban areas are less likely than people in suburban and rural areas to agree. Regionally Americans in the Northeast are least likely to think the news media is against people. www.usnews.com — July 2 2019 With “fools” like these … it’s only a matter of time before — the rash political rhetoric becomes the becomes the “rally cries” by which a democratic nation falls ... The phrase "the enemy of the people" has a long history that Trump may or may not have known about. Over the course of the last century it has been used repeatedly by dictators and autocrats to delegitimize foreign governments opposition parties and dissenters. Though the phrase dates back to Roman times and the reign of Emperor Nero (who was declared "an enemy of the people" by the Roman Senate) it came into use in the modern period during the French Revolution. Ennemi du peuple was used to refer to those who disagreed with the new French government during the "Reign of Terror" a period during which thousands of revolutionairies were executed by guillotine. [...] It gained its widest use by Joseph Stalin during the early years of the Soviet Union. In the nation's early years Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin used the term vrag naroda (enemy of the nation/people) to refer to those who disagreed with the ideologies pushed forth by the Bolshevik government and later adopted by the newly-formed Soviet Union. This could include anyone from the clergy who did not want to adopt state-enforced atheism to writers to political opposition that questioned the ideologies of the new government. Later picked up by Stalin such a designation could mean immediate imprisonment or removal to a labour camp. www.businessinsider.com — July 2 2019 Repeating “rally cries” and “fake rationales” like these — who knows just where they were intended to lead ...  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental AffairsCommittee on Rules and Administration B-1 Appendix B:  Transcript of President Trump’s Speech at the “Save America Rally” on January 6  [...] But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we’ve never seen anything like it.  You can go all the way back.You know America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said we don’t have free and fair elections.  And you know what else? We don’t have a free and fair press. Our media is not free it’s not fair. It suppresses thought it suppresses speech and it’s become the enemy of the people. It’s become the enemy of the people. It’s the biggest problem we have in this country. [...] And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us and if he doesn’t that will be a a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to uphold our Constitution. [...] Today for the sake of our democracy for the sake of our Constitution and for the sake of our children we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it? In every single swing state local officials state officials almost all Democrats made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures. That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that. [...] So in Pennsylvania you had 205000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it’s a total fraud. So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people lots of dead people thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more. [...] You will have an illegitimate president. That’s what you’ll have. And we can’t let that happen. [...] According to eyewitness testimony Postal Service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state. [...] In Georgia your secretary of state who I can’t believe this guy’s a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what’s going on. These people are crooked. They’re 100% in my opinion one of the most corrupt between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess. And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures. [...] The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That’s the only way you could explain it. By the way you’re talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years they should have been approximately 45000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win just over 11000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11000 votes that’s all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia and we’re not going to forget it. [...] The radical left knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re ruthless and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories. [...] Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements still away. [...] And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore. With “friends” like these … who need Elections?  With insidious Liars like these … we may not be so lucky the next time …  The “enemies” Trump raves on about are only the “props and the foils” — in his ongoing Machiavellian game. Not that he knows much about History.  Trump’s talents reside in a whole other contemptible arena. — — Here's the full text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress or elector of President and Vice President or hold any office civil or military under the United States or under any state who having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer of the United States or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive or judicial officer of any state to support the Constitution of the United States shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House remove such disability." […] Federal prosecutors are investigating Trump's role inciting the Capitol insurrection which could in theory lead to his being convicted in a court of law. Such a conviction could give Congress the authority to pass a law barring Trump from office on the premise that he had "engaged in insurrection or rebellion" as the 14th Amendment states. www.businessinsider.com — Feb 14 2021 … speaking of quote:  "enemy of the people" … can we finally quit “coddling” them … with “kid gloves”?  It is more important to outhink your enemy than to outfight him.
