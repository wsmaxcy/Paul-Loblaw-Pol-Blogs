C, Looking ahead to 2024, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-11, Just for fun I assume the folks at FiveThirtyEight decided to hold a  “Way-Too-Early 2024 Republican Presidential Primary Draft.” The format was that of a fantasy football or baseball draft with five members taking turns selecting potential Republican candidates for president in 2024.  It’s clear that the draft participants don’t like Republicans. However they appear to have drafted objectively at least until just before the end. Based on the draft results here in order are the 15 Republicans considered by the staff collectively as most likely to be nominated: 
Donald Trump
Ted Cruz
Ron DeSantis
Nikki Haley
Mike Pence
Donald Trump Jr.
Kristi Noem
Josh Hawley
Tim Scott
Tucker Carlson
Mike Pompeo
Greg Abbott
Tom Cotton
Ivanka Trump
Marco Rubio
 Actually the last pick was Marjorie Taylor Greene. Rubio received some form of honorable mention. However I’ve done the FiveThirtyEight gang the favor of cleaning this up.  I don’t have many opinions about the list other than to agree that it’s “way to early” to come up with a good one. I do think that Tom Cotton is too far down the list. Ted Cruz might be too far up it. The list suggests to me that the GOP is not lacking quality candidates for president. At this point subject to further review I would be comfortable with about two-thirds of those selected in this “draft.” Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
