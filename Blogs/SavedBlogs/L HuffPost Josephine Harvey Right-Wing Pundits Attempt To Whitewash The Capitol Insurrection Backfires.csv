A riot? A coup attempt?” he asked. “If it doesn’t walk like a duck or talk like a duck then it probably isn’t a duck.” That man Adam Christian Johnson was arrested in January and charged with entering a restricted a building or grounds without lawful authority theft of government property and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
