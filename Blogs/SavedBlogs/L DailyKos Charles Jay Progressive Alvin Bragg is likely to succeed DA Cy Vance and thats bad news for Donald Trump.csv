L, Progressive Alvin Bragg is likely to succeed DA Cy Vance and that's bad news for Donald Trump, Charles Jay, 2021-07-02, Alvin Bragg a progressive prosecutor is on course to become Manhattan’s first black district attorney after his main opponent in the Democratic primary conceded on Friday. And that isn’t good news for Donald Trump. We did it! We made history. Wow.Thanks to the thousands of Manhattanites who came together to say in one clear voice that #JusticeCantWait. I promise that I will never stop working to fight every day for fairness and safety. #JusticeForAll https://t.co/mM6dbf6D6d  “This has been a long journey that started in Harlem. And today that 15-year-old boy who was stopped numerous times at gunpoint by the police is the Democratic nominee to be Manhattan District Attorney” Bragg said in a statement released Friday afternoon. Bragg also oversaw a lawsuit against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and his company for creating a hostile work environment. And at the State Attorney General’s office Bragg also led a special unit that investigated police-involved killings of unarmed civilians. So  Bragg will likely be the one taking over the tax-fraud prosecution of the Trump Organization and its Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg as well as any further cases resulting from the ongoing investigation into Donald Trump’s financial dealings. And Bragg is definitely up to the challenge. Prior to working at the State Attorney General’s Offfice he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. He successfully prosecuted corrupt politicians and obtained a trial verdict convicting the owner of a multi-million dollar business for laundering millions of dollars for an international drug cartel. The initial tally of early and in-person voting in the June 22 primary showed Bragg leading seven other candidates. He had 34% of the vote while his closest rival former federal prosecutor Tali Farhadian Weinstein had 30%. The race was considered too close to call because there were nearly 40000 absentee ballots still to be counted. But Farhadian-Weinstein conceded the race Friday when she acknowledged that she could not overtake Bragg’s lead based on the absentee ballot count. Farhadian-Weinstein whose husband is a millionaire hedge fund manager ran a more centrist campaign vowing to aggressively prosecute violent crimes. This was the only Democratic primary race that was not decided by NYC’s new ranked-choice voting system because the district attorney’s office is a state rather than a city position. Bragg should have no problem defeating Republican Thomas Kenniff in the November general election in heavily Democratic Manhattan. Bragg has said that the Trump investigation is only one of the important tasks that he’ll be focusing on as New York County (Manhattan) D.A.  The biggest challenge will be how to address concerns about public safety while instituting policies to create a more equitable criminal justice system. His campaign pledges included: creating a survivor-centered sex crimes unit; expanding the Hate Crimes Unit; stopping gun trafficking into NYC to help reduce gun violence; establishing a new Workers Protection Unit to deal with wage theft and exploitation; investigating wrongful convictions; safeguarding immigrants from targeting by ICE; expanding alternatives to incarceration and  launching a new Police Integrity Unit. Bragg’s candidacy was helped by endorsements from former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Preet Bharara; Rep. Jerrold Nadler; Gwen Carr the mother of police choking victim Eric Garner and The New York Times. Bragg a lifelong Harlem resident attended Harvard and Harvard Law School. He’ll bring a fresh look to the Manhattan D.A.’s office which for nearly half a century was led by the sons of two prominent Cabinet members in Democratic administrations. Robert Morgenthau  (1975-2009) was the son of FDR’s Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. and Vance (2010-2021) is the son of Cyrus Vance who was Secretary of  State under President Jimmy Carter.
