C, Spring break, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-04-18, We didn’t take a winter vacation this year because of the pandemic. But now that we’re vaccinated and pretty confident about our immunity we’re going to take a spring break.  We’ll be gone for about a week and I don’t plan on posting during that time. If Minneapolis burns this week John and Scott will be on hand to cover it. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
