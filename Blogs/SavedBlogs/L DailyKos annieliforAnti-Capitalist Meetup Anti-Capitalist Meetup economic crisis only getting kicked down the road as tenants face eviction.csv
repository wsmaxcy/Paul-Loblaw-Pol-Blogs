L, Anti-Capitalist Meetup: economic crisis only getting kicked down the road as tenants face eviction, annieliforAnti-Capitalist Meetup, 2021-06-27, There’s enough living space for all Americans just like healthcare and a basic income. Capitalists don’t think “those people” are a priority or anything other than a liability. The long term trajectory of capitalism is towards a rentier society as Marx anticipated. At present there are encouraging signs for the overall US economy but that snapshot has a horizon. There is a looming crisis in housing and employment that will catch up to the US economy by 2022 and figure in a possible economic downturn that could range from stagflation to recession. In the US the GOP will count on that unrest for reelection. The wealthiest country in human history has trouble keeping its people housed even in good times. In 2017 the United States boasted one of the strongest economies in the world and nearly half of its tenants were rent burdened. A majority of households in the bottom quintile of our nation’s income distribution give more than 40 percent of their disposable income to landlords each month. Only three other developed countries force their poor to shoulder heavier housing costs. nymag.com/... 91000 Mass. tenants behind on rent and owe $335 million. as an average of 227 people lose their housing every day in Los Angeles. Where in Chicago bailiff evictions remain paused but eviction hearings are going ahead and with rising numbers of people unemployed thousands face losing their homes. “Renters lacked capacity to build savings prior to crisis and this disparity only worsened as a result of COVID underscoring the importance of assisting renters during difficult economic periods.” ...improving housing stability and addressing the ongoing eviction crisis—only temporarily held in check by an unprecedented array of federal state and local protections for renters—requires more: an investment in the data infrastructure necessary to root out discrimination ensure tenants’ rights and target hazardous housing conditions. slate.com/... As capitalism develops and the remains of feudal and other pre-capitalist relationships are dissolved the tendency is for the same persons who play the economic role of capitalists to also play the economic role of landlords. Feudal property gives way to capitalist real estate (2) critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/... Landlords' right has its origin in robbery. There is the landed property feudally inherited and the sub-population of hobby farms and investment speculation of  condos/townhouses. Their multiplicity of rents are collected and sought often only as development rights that can include air columns and prized views shifted into property rights and sometimes appropriated by eminent domain to build infrastructure or create questionable development projects. Wages rents and profits are the three major categories of revenue allocation emerging with capitalist relations and like these they are historical. Remember though that landlords' right has its origin in robbery. Evictions also reactivate a price system for increases in rent-setting where most states do not have rent-control or rent stabilization. One element of this is the difference between the US and the remainder of the planet on the definition of social housing. The renters of land and the money lenders are structurally identical or as with the Trump Organization have a family resemblance. No different are the actions of minor capitalists like previous guy as we’ll see prosecuted in the coming weeks. Since the improvements in the quality of the land accrues to its owners the rapid increase in the price of urban real estate is an example of the private appropriation of the benefits of public investments. (Basu 2018) Discussing the same issue Marx notes how landowners reap benefits of investments made by others. “His rent thus swells; or if he plans to sell the land ... its value has now risen. He does not sell just the land but rather the improved land the capital incorporated into the earth which has cost him nothing. This is one of the secrets ... of the increasing enrichment of the landowners the constant inflation of their rents and the growing money value of their estates as economic development progresses. Thus they put away in their own private purses the result of a social development achieved without their participation - they are fruge consumere nati. (Horace)” (Marx 1993 pp. 757 [V.III]). Profit—whether profit of enterprise or interest—appears as a flow of income in the form of money. Under capitalism the rent of land also presents itself as a flow of money which as we have seen is actually just like profit part of the surplus value produced by the unpaid labor of the working class. (7) If a person with money wants to obtain some of this surplus value and doesn’t want to take on the risks of becoming an industrial or commercial capitalist that person has two choices. He or she can lend out the money to industrial or commercial capitalists either directly or through the banking system or that person can buy land—again for reasons of simplification not realism we assume the land is unimproved.The person after the purchase of the land will not be a capitalist because the asset purchased does not have value. Capital is made up of commodities and money. Land is neither. However the person who bought the land like a capitalist has legal title to a portion of the unpaid labor produced by the working class. We call such a person a landowner. Under the capitalist mode of production land can be bought and sold as though it is a commodity. When individuals invest in land they therefore expect the same rate of return that they would get if they lent the money to an industrial or commercial capitalist. (8) In their minds they will imagine that the land they have bought is capital—since we can assume they are not deep into the study of Marx’s critique of political economy and are really not interested in the “technicalities.” They have made an investment in land. They will therefore expect the same rate of return on their investment that they would get if they lent the money out on interest. (9) This process of forming an imaginary or fictitious capital is called “capitalization.” Assuming the actual rent remains unchanged the price of land therefore moves inversely to the rate of interest. If interest rates rise the price of land—or the “value” of the imaginary capital—will fall. If the rate of interest falls the “value” of the imaginary capital or the price of land will rise. Let’s assume that an acre of land sells for $100 and the interest is 5 percent. The price of land will be 100/.05 or $2000. If the rate of interest rises to 10 percent the price of an acre of land will fall to $1000. If the rate of interest falls to 2.5 percent the price of land will rise to $4000 per acre.critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/…   The Brookings Institution provides some of the empirical details for the direction of housing crisis and recovery in the post-pandemic period. In some ways the current economic situation is the inverse of the Great Recession. In that crisis foreclosures and collapsing prices hit homeowners first before the recession spread into rental markets. Despite this difference the Great Recession and recovery from it can offer some context and insights into how households and housing markets might fare as the U.S. economy recovers from COVID-19. In this brief we analyze several measures of housing distress from 2007 to 2019 for six metro areas chosen based on their housing and labor market characteristics. Los Angeles Riverside Calif. Las Vegas and Phoenix were among the areas foreclosures hit hardest. Job markets in Las Vegas Orlando Fla. and New Orleans depend heavily on tourism and hospitality industries which are disproportionately suffering in the public health emergency. How housing markets in these metro areas recovered from the Great Recession offers some guidance for what to expect over the next few years. HOUSING DISTRESS LASTED WELL BEYOND THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION The Great Recession lasted from December 2007 through June 2009. But two key metrics—housing prices and homeownership rates—show that housing markets continued to worsen for several years. Homeownership rates reached historic heights during the housing boom of the early and mid-2000s fueled in part by widespread expansion of mortgage availability and loosened underwriting criteria. The foreclosure crisis that triggered the Great Recession caused homeownership rates to decline sharply in all six metro areas in this analysis generally hitting a trough around 2014—nearly five years after the recession officially “ended” (Figure 1). Most metro areas (except Los Angeles) have seen homeownership rebound by several percentage points from the lowest point although not all have returned to their pre-Great Recession peaks.   Graphing the ratio of renter-to-homeowner cost burdens (Figure 4) shows that renting became relatively more expensive for middle-income households in all six metro areas. (This graph shows ratios for households in the three middle-income quintiles; a large majority of households in the highest income quintile are homeowners with most households in the lowest quintile renting.) www.brookings.edu/…  [How this solution of the housing question by means of chaining worker to his own “home” is arising spontaneously in the neighborhood of big or growing American towns can be seen from the following passage of a letter by Eleanor Marx-Aveling Indianapolis November 28 1886: “In or rather near Kansas City we saw some miserable little wooden huts containing about three rooms each still in the wilds; the land cost 600 dollars and was just enough to put the little house on it; the latter cost a further 600 dollars that is together about 4800 marks [£240] for a miserable little thing an hour away from the town in a muddy desert.” In this way the workers must shoulder heavy mortgage debts in order to obtain even these houses and thus they become completely the slaves of their employers; they are bound to their houses they cannot go away and they are compelled to put up with whatever working conditions are offered them. — Note by F. Engels to the second German edition.] How is the housing question to be solved then? In present-day society just as any other social question is solved: by the gradual economic adjustment of supply and demand a solution which ever reproduces the question itself anew and therefore is no solution. How a social revolution would solve this question depends not only on the circumstances which would exist in each case but is also connected with still more far-reaching questions among which one of the most fundamental is the abolition of the antithesis between town and country. As it is not our task to create utopian systems for the arrangement of the future society it would be more than idle to go into the question here. But one thing is certain: there are already in existence sufficient buildings for dwellings in the big towns to remedy immediately any real “housing shortage” given rational utilization of them. This can naturally only take place by the expropriation of the present owners and by quartering in their houses the homeless or those workers excessively overcrowded in their former houses. Immediately the proletariat has conquered political power such a measure dictated in the public interests will be just as easy to carry out as other expropriations and billetings are by the existing state. www.marxists.org/...  “Rich men in Ohio get richer by taking our money while we living like this” one KC Tenants leader said as the group released its People’s Housing Trust Fund proposal. “That ain’t right.” https://t.co/6FqietKcd1   A June 11 letter to President Biden signed by 12 large real estate and landlord associations cheerfully asserts that the economy is recovering unemployment has fallen rental assistance programs have worked and vaccination rates are high enough that the pandemic danger is all but passed: “As the Administration continues its support for housing we urge you to sunset the nationwide federal moratorium on evictions on June 30th and focus on targeted housing support for those renters who continue to recover from the pandemic” the letter says. Although the GDP and the stock market are both doing well many Americans are still struggling. March 2021 saw the highest poverty rate recorded during the pandemic: 11.1 percent. Unemployment in June 2021 was more than 2 percent higher than it was in February 2020. And with vaccine rates dropping and the Delta variant spreading fast the COVID-19 pandemic is far from behind us. “I think [people] would for the most part be evicted into homelessness” says Rose Lenahan of the Los Angeles Tenants Union (LATU). “It’s very unclear what they would do.” The landlords are correct about one thing: Rental assistance could theoretically go a long way toward solving the immediate crisis. And while many state and municipal programs got off to a slow start the U.S. has started to see uneven but significant progress in getting this money to the people desperately in need of relief. But time is running out. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended the moratorium to July 30 2021 on Thursday the agency indicated that this will be the last extension. Many state eviction programs are still scheduled to expire on the CDC’s original June 30 deadline. [...] Lenahan Marshall and other organizers across the country are acutely aware that local protections may soon be the only thing standing between struggling tenants and eviction. With the CDC moratorium badly weakened and scheduled to sunset responsibility falls on states and municipalities to avert a catastrophe that could irreparably damage millions of lives. truthout.org/...

We presupposed private property the separation of labor capital and land and of wages profit of capital and rent of land – likewise division of labor competition the concept of exchange value etc. On the basis of political economy itself in its own words we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production; that the necessary result of competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form; and that finally the distinction between capitalist and land rentier like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory worker disappears and that the whole of society must fall apart into the two classes – property owners and propertyless workers. www.marxists.org/...

In late January 1871 government troops fired on demonstrators outside the Hotel de Ville. Soon afterwards the GND finally did what they had long planned and announced they were prepared to surrender to the Prussian military leader Otto von Bismarck. The Prussians insisted on draconian concessions including the loss of two territories Alsace and East Lorraine and huge war reparations. Elections in February saw the reactionary Adolphe Thiers lead a new national assembly packed with monarchists and rural reactionaries. The assembly antagonised Parisian workers and small businessmen by threatening to cancel the wages of many national guards and demanding that rent arrears and all debts be paid immediately. This threat of bankruptcy along with the danger of a monarchist restoration and Prussian reprisals led to a new radicalisation amongst the poor and middle layers in society. www.socialistparty.org.uk/… The Commune imposed a moratorium on debt payments and rent for those Parisians left without work since the German invasion and requisitioned empty apartments for others whom Prussian and French cannon fire had left homeless. At the same time it acknowledged the right to pay parity for men and women and the need to separate state and church. www.foreignaffairs.com/... David Harvey’s 1970s formulations of class monopoly rent explicitly derive this exact idea from marx’s writing for application to urban land and housing. the influence of class monopoly rent in contemporary processes of urban redevelopment is far more pervasive than often recognised — David Harvey You can get a small apartment or a sprawling mansion. Rent-seeking is an attempt to obtain economic rent (i.e. the portion of income paid to a factor of production in excess of what is needed to keep it employed in its current use) by manipulating the social or political environment in which economic activities occur rather than by creating new wealth. Rent-seeking implies extraction of uncompensated value from others without making any contribution to productivity. In many market-driven economies much of the competition for rents is legal regardless of harm it may do to an economy. However various rent-seeking behaviors are illegal mostly through bribery of local and federal politicians or corruption. Rent-seeking is distinguished in theory from profit-seeking in which entities seek to extract value by engaging in mutually beneficial transactions.[5] Profit-seeking in this sense is the creation of wealth while rent-seeking is "profiteering" by using social institutions such as the power of the state to redistribute wealth among different groups without creating new wealth.[6] In a practical context income obtained through rent-seeking may contribute to profits in the standard accounting sense of the word. en.wikipedia.org/… www.cssny.org/… In Vienna 62% of its citizens reside in public housing.
