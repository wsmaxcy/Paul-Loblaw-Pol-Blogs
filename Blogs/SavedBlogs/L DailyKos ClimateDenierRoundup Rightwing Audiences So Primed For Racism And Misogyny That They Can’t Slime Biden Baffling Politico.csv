L, Rightwing Audiences So Primed For Racism And Misogyny That They Can’t Slime Biden Baffling Politico, ClimateDenierRoundup, 2021-04-29, Yesterday Politico’s Melanie Zanona and Burgess Everett published a story about how Republicans “are hoping to puncture Biden’s popularity without getting down in the mud.” It seems the party that was all too eager to attack Biden’s (Black) presidential predecessor and regularly heaps abuse on the (female) counterpart leading the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi and can’t shut up about (Latina) Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Senator (((Bernie Sanders))) for some reason has nothing but collegial respect for President (white man) Biden.  Politico a brand supposedly built on a working knowledge of the ins and outs of politics appears to be unaware of racism sexism or antisemitism and instead guessingly attributes it to Republicans thinking Biden’s policies are “unpopular enough on their own” (oh like Obamacare?) or because some of them have “a personal relationship with the president.” This despite the fact that they have similar working relationships with longtime House and Senate figures Nancy Pelosi and Bernie Sanders who Politico uses in the story as counterpoints without any indication that it’s quite obviously Biden’s identity as a white Christian man that has left the GOP’s finely tuned racist messaging machine flailing for an attack that works.  At this point conservative media doesn’t even necessarily have to bother adding its own racism to its coverage because it knows its audience is already so well-primed for it that it’s unnecessary. Three posts yesterday show how it works.  First let’s look at “Nazis built our brand” Breitbart which chose to highlight comments Rep. Pramila Jayapal made over the weekend about President Biden’s infrastructure bill. But there isn’t the invective one might expect in the story appearing in the famously racist website as it’s mostly just a retelling of her speech about “transitioning to a clean green economy.” It’s got a barb from a Republican about how Biden’s plan is not about infrastructure but then closes with a quote where Rep. Jayapal explains all the ways in which it’s totally about infrastructure. If you just stumbled on the link and didn’t know about Breitbart you’d think it was a pretty fair story.  It was the same play over at ClimateDepot where champion of this tactic Marc Morano splashed Rhiana Gunn-Wright’s smiling headshot on the home page and twice on the repost of an interview she gave with Atmos headlined “there’s no Green New Deal without police abolition.” Gunn-Wright explains that “police brutality is an environmental justice issue” because “environmental justice is not just about air pollution” (which a new study shows hurts communities of color worse regardless of economics) but also “what makes up your physical environment including policing public safety education clean water. All of that is part of a person’s physical environment.” As an element of the physical environment of people’s world racist policing is environmental racism.  In addition to that and a “willingness to recognize that the system we have doesn’t work” another reason police abolition needs to be part of an overarching climate agenda is the fact that “those first anti-protest bills came out of lobbying from fossil fuel companies that wanted to prohibit protests around fossil fuel infrastructure” so cops are often quite literally paid by the industry to spy on arrest imprison or assault the climate activists like you dear reader who they treat “like an enemy on the battlefield” according to international Human Rights groups. Gunn-Wright says it’s a matter of “thinking about the ways that police are employed to protect capital and maintain certain people in certain places.” So it’s “very connected to the climate crisis especially as you think about resources becoming more scarce.” (Just ask the Pinkertons…) All very true very smart stuff that stands in stark contrast to the rest of the unhinged denial at Climate Depot but left entirely uncontested in the post itself.   Finally Fox News had a similarly styled story yesterday about Shalanda Baker President Biden’s nominee for the Department of Energy’s Office of Minority Economic Impact and what it considers her scandalous behavior: supporting the Green New Deal and writing a book calling for an energy transition. Fox News summarizes and quotes extensively from her book for example describing her writing about “how existing ‘corporate and financial interests’ behind fossil fuels have more recently looked to ‘jockey for space to maintain influence in the renewable energy economy.’ She claimed that without radical change minority communities will continue to face injustice.”  Fox News’s Ronn Blitzer who “reported” this story — that someone nominated for a position in the Energy Department’s Office of Minority Economic Impact wrote a book about the economic impact of energy on minority communities — made no attempt at rebutting or refuting or even offering contrasting opinions to suggest Baker was in any way incorrect in her analysis. He didn’t have to.  Because just like the Breitbart story and just like at Climate Depot all Fox News had to do was include a headshot of the subject of the story in each case a woman of color and its audience knew exactly how to feel: triggered.  Yet to the otherwise often quite sharp reporters at Politico apparently it’s a real mystery why Republicans can’t seem to smear President Biden.
