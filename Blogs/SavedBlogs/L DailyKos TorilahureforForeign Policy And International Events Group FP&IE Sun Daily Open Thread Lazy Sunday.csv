While there may have been many news about US position and action on China here at The Diplomat an article explaining what EU is doing.  Think the EU Isn’t Acting on China? Look Closer. The European Union (EU) tends to get a bad rap in English-language political commentary (and not only there). In an increasingly conflict-prone international system that is being upended by a resurgent China and a United States defending its global primacy the EU seems ill at ease and takes criticism for issues ranging from ineffectiveness to disunity to poor strategic judgment. It would seem the EU is woefully under-equipped for the return of history. Criticisms of this sort are sometimes warranted but at other times they miss part of what is happening on the ground and point to a misunderstanding of what the EU is and how it works. First of all it is important to recall what the EU is not: It is not a federal state but an international organization of sovereign states. It was created first and foremost to ensure peace between its members and secondly to increase prosperity by liberalizing trade. In these goals it has succeeded admirably. The exercise of geopolitical power has not been part of its job description until very recently and it takes time to adjust to such a role. 📚📒🌏 Middle East - South Asia: Over at  Modern Diplomacy article examining the rising diplomatic activities between Middle-East and South Asia. The Increasing Role of Middle East Diplomacy in South Asia Recently in a sudden revelation the United Arab Emirates (UAE) envoy to the US revealed that his country is in the process of initiating dialogue and discussions between India and Pakistan. In course of a virtual discussion he talked about UAE desire to help the two countries to have a functional and operational relationship accepting that they might not turn out to be the best of friends in recent future. Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba confirmed that his country played an important role in bringing down the tensions on the borders. The UAE was also instrumental in the sudden and unexpected Line of Control (LOC) border agreement on 25th January. It was followed up by the visit of UAE foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed to New Delhi and Islamabad subsequently. The powerful Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa who virtually holds a veto in military and diplomatic issues also voiced his support to the development when he publicly talked about “to bury the past and move forward” for two nations. There have also been reports of secret parleys on the issue among top intelligence officials from Research & Analysis Wing (RAW India) and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI Pakistan) in Dubai in January. 📒🚰📱🌏 Brazil: Worrying trends in what is already a dire situation Al Jazeera has coverage Brazilians are not showing up for their second COVID vaccination Brazil’s COVID-19 vaccination programme is being put at risk by people failing to show up for their second shot with 1.5 million people missing appointments for the follow-up dose needed to maximise protection according to the Health Ministry. Specialists say that is particularly concerning after a recent real-world study from Chile found that the Sinovac Biotech COVID-19 vaccine which has accounted for some 80 percent of Brazil’s program is just 16 percent effective after one shot. “Without the two doses we get neither full protection nor a long duration of protection” Juarez Cunha head of the Brazilian Society of Immunizations told Reuters. “We need people to do the full cycle.” Until this week more people were dying in Brazil of COVID-19 than anywhere in the world with President Jair Bolsonaro widely criticised for opposing lockdown measures and pushing remedies like hydroxychloroquine that provide little or no benefit. India has now surpassed Brazil in daily deaths. 📒🚰📱🌏 The Koreas: Over at Asia Times a look at how doe North Korean defectors fare No shortcut to freedom for North Korea’s defectors SEOUL – North Korean defectors may be the most invisible displaced persons on earth. Why so? Firstly their estimated numbers are low – likely a drop in the bucket compared with those in war-torn areas of the Middle East Africa and Southeast Asia – and are largely unknown given that they are not massed in refugee camps but hide out in secrecy in China. A tiny number make it all the way to South Korea. Just 33752 have defected since the Korean War ended in 1953 according to official data from Seoul. Their paths are virtually undocumented by global media. This opacity is inevitable given the secrecy that is essential for the “underground railway” – the secret routes and networks of people smugglers that convey defectors from North Korea to South Korea. Contrary to conventional wisdom it is not terribly difficult to exit North Korea. While the country’s southern border with South Korea the Demilitarized Zone is almost airtight its northern border with China has until 2020 been permeable.
