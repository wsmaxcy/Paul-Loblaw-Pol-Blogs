L, Joe Biden Celebrates Obamacare Ruling With A Blast From The Past, Ryan Grenoble, 2021-06-17, Obamacare has survived yet another Supreme Court ruling inspiring President Joe Biden to dust off one of his greatest gaffes hits. In a statement hailing the 7-2 decision that protects the health insurance of 31 million Americans including those with preexisting conditions Biden on Thursday called the ruling “a big win for the American people.” “With millions of people relying on the Affordable Care Act for coverage it remains as ever a BFD” he added. “And it’s here to stay.” A big win for the American people. There’s no better day than today to sign up for quality affordable health care at https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj.With millions of people relying on the Affordable Care Act for coverage it remains as ever a BFD. And it’s here to stay. https://t.co/5GPl9aR8uB “BFD” is a cheeky reference to a moment way back in 2010 when Biden who was vice president at the time congratulated President Barack Obama on the passage of the Affordable Care Act by ever-so-quietly dropping an F-bomb on live television. “This is a big fucking deal” he murmured in Obama’s ear at a news conference. Biden later apologized for the slip-up as some conservatives howled in anger over his impropriety. The veep reflected on the incident in 2014 when a speaker brought it up ahead of a charity bike ride. “Piece of advice about that BFD stuff: Assume every microphone is on” he joked. “I just want you to know I didn’t intentionally say that” Biden added. “I actually turned and I said ‘Mr. President’ and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips — not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips.” “Thank God my mother was gone or I’d have been one dead vice president” he said.   In a followup statement on Thursday the White House cast the new Supreme Court ruling as “a victory for every American who prior to the Affordable Care Act stayed up at night staring at the ceiling wondering whether they would lose everything if they or a loved one got sick.” “After more than a decade of attacks on the Affordable Care Act through the Congress and the courts today’s decision – the third major challenge to the law that the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected – it is time move forward and keep building on this landmark law” the statement added. Obama echoed that sentiment in a series of tweets﻿ and reaffirmed the fundamental need for universal health care coverage. Today the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. Again. This ruling reaffirms what we have long known to be true: the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. The principle of universal coverage has been established and 31 million people now have access to care through the law we passed—with millions more who can no longer be denied coverage or charged more because of a preexisting condition.
