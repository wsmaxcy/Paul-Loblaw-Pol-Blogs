One of the nation’s largest states is taking on Big Tech. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is likely to sign into law a bill that would prevent social media companies Facebook Twitter and Google’s YouTube from “deplatforming” politicians such as former President Donald Trump. The bill was approved Thursday by the Republican-controlled state Legislature. It would order social media companies to publish standards with detailed definitions of when someone would be censored or blocked and make companies subject to as much as $250000 daily fines for deplatforming a Florida candidate. The bill would require a social media company to notify users within seven days that they could be censored giving them time to correct posts. Republican lawmakers in Florida said legislation is needed to curb the influence the nation’s leading social media companies have over the national conversation.
