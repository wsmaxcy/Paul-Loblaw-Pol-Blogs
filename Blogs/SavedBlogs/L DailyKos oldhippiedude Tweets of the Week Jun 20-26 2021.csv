L, Tweets of the Week Jun 20-26 2021, oldhippiedude, 2021-06-27, This week we’re going to try something a little different with our poll. Why? Because I feel like it that’s why.

Widely described as a “redneck rave” the event included numerous drunken fights at least one severed finger a self-impaling several meth busts hundreds of Trump flags and most horrifying of all something called “country rap” music.  So your challenge this week is to pick from several options for a fitting name for the big party in Kentucky. I can hardly wait to see the results. Of course we have the usual assortment of right-wing idiocy before we get to that. So without further ado let’s get started.

They don't know how to find the magnetic field using Ampere's law. They don't want physics textbooks. They don't even know how an interferometer works.
