L, Thoroughly pissed because of a TERF, Elixa, 2021-04-22, I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress lately in my life so one of my oldest friends Cael invited me to a discord server that was about venting your traumas and stress so the others in the server can help you deal with it.  So I went on and I shared some of my trauma in this case the multiple sexual assaults I have survived.  Then the server owner came on and said “OH But you’re a transwoman with an intersexed condition you can’t be raped.”  I got pissed as did several other members of the server but Cael wanted to continue the cheering people up rather than letting the server owner bring everyone down.  So we started talking about crushes we all had as children and after I went the server owner who had said nothing about what anyone else said some of whom said they fantasized about more than what I said which was “I had a crush on Elizabeth Shue as a kid and used to fantasize about cuddling with them.” the server owner came on again and said towards me “You know fantasizing about other people in a romantic or sexual way should be counted as rape” to me… the survivor of multiple sexual assaults.  I left the channel immediately.  About twenty minutes later my friend Cael contacted me and told me that everyone in the server had left after the server owner said one thing after I left.  “Good now the freak is gone.”  That line pissed off my friend Cael who is an enby and their wife is trans as well.  Cael was the last one to leave the server owner alone in there simply because they were ripping the owner of the server a new one.  I had to take my ptsd meds early today because of this.  Feeling better now though...
