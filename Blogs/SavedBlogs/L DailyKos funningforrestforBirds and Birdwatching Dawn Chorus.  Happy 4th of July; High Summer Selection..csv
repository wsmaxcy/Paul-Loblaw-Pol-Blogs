L, Dawn Chorus.  Happy 4th of July; High Summer Selection., funningforrestforBirds and Birdwatching, 2021-07-04, Whoof!  We’re here moving into high summer already?  The year seems to be passing so fast and my “Birds for 2021” list has grown much too full to show them all (fifty-nine SIXTY! See the end of diary but don’t skip ahead if you can help it) different species photographed as of this writing; I had a couple of duplicates in my list and have corrected this now) so I’ve picked a selection of several that take pride of place for me.  I have to say that the weeks of winter here around Quincy CA were surprisingly productive.  Through the months: January     February  March  Wow.  Now that I look at it spring has been very rewarding also. April      May            June     JULY Made it by golly.  Just yesterday (July 3) and across the street from my house at that.  #60 for my 2021 bird species count and what a gorgeous bird.  I’d been hearing and hearing this bird for the past many weeks but never was able to spot it before and didn’t know what it was.  It’s call/song is very distinctive though.  I was heading out to Dellinger’s Pond but heard and spotted the bird immediately upon getting to my sidewalk in front of my place.  By the time I put my binoculars down and grabbed the camera it had flown off.  So I went a little further to get into position set up my field chair and sat down and put my camera on my tripod and listened trying to spot the bird by pinpointing its position by sound.  There it was that distinctive call but where was the bird?  Scan and scan with the binoculars pointed toward the sound looking in the trees thirty yards off.  Then I saw the bird not much more than twenty feet away right in the top of a short tree.  Here’s what my Keith Hansen Birds of the Sierra Nevada says: Voice:  Male clambers atop bushes to broadcast.  Song two sharp introductory notes followed by level trill with tuning-fork quality: tsit chid-d-d-d-d-d-d-ddd.  Shy at heart but exposes itself with nasal catlike mewww or questioning shaw-wEEE?  Infrequently utters piercing notes on level pitch. And here’s the bird: Lookin’ at ya! Now what’s up in your birdy world?  What’s cookin’ for your Fourth of July?
