L, GOP Congress Racist Cancel Culture on Display: DC Statehood, DrLou, 2021-04-23, GOP 'Racist Trash' Nailed by the Gentleman from New York I hadn’t planned to post today but found this brief comment by a Black member of the House of Representatives which I wanted to share. I encourage you to click on the link to hear what he said and what resulted. He clearly directly called out - and I quote - the ‘racist trash’ in Congress based on arguments being made against DC statehood. Needless to say that same racist trash did their best to invoke direct examples of ‘cancel culture’ by the Right. Democrats in the House and Senate must show the courage seen in this video and call out these racist bastards at each and every opportunity. White entitlement is over. I’m originally from Baltimore and know all the GOP arguments that have kept DC from becoming a state. The most prevalent but hardly said is that DC is predominately POC who vote predominately for Democrats. Cancelling DC statehood is has now become part of the GOP’s desperate effort to suppress and subtract voters since the GOP still have no issues on which to run; nothing to offer but white nationalism and racist ‘attention politics.’ The hard reality is that DC has a far larger tax paying population than the states of Wyoming or Rhode Island. Wyoming which is well over 80% white has two Senators and members of the House. DC which is majority black has no Senators and no voting members in the House. Reinvigorated attempts to blend DC into Maryland will not and should not work. DC has it’s own government taxes City Council laws police and fire protection regular elections social and other services. DC citizens pay taxes despite having absolutely no representation in Congress. It is long time past due for DC to become a state. If the GOP wants to talk again about the Founders original ‘intent;’ they should reflect on the fact that the Founders certainly did not and would not tolerate Taxation Without Representation - yet here it is still in 2021. The GOP only become constitutional 'Originalists' when they want to (1) attack selected states; (2) violate the Founders intent for a living and dynamic Constitution; (3) violate rights of non-preferred Americans with a strong focus on Black and POC; (4) impose their false and dishonest beliefs; (5) legislate medial malpractice; or (6) lobby for gun manufacturers’ It is time for DC to be granted full statehood.
