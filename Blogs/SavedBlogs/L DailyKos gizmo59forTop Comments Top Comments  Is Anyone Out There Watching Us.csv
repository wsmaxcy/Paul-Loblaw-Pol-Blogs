L, Top Comments:  Is Anyone Out There Watching Us?, gizmo59forTop Comments, 2021-07-01, For the past 30 years astronomers have used several clever strategies to detect the presence of planets orbiting around other stars.  This is a remarkable achievement given how far away even the closest stars to the Sun are and how comparatively small plants are compared to stars.  More than 4000 such exoplanets as they’re called have been discovered thus far. A group of astronomers decided to reverse the question:  Within a 10000 year interval how many stars within 300 lightyears would be in a position where alien astronomers there would be able to detect the Earth?  The specific detection strategy considered was detecting a planet during its transit across the visible face of its star.  As the planet traverses between the star and an observer the light intensity will decrease slightly.  Note that this phenomenon can only be observed when the observer is essentially in the plane of the plant’s orbit around its star.  The authors of this study specifically looked for stars that would be in a position to observe the traverse of the Earth across the face of the Sun. However there’s a complication.  Stars move relative to each other and over millennia these motions are observable.  Thus the various stars move in and out of the region where Earth could be detected.  Fortunately the Gaia spacecraft launched by the European Space Agency collected data on local stars to determine their precise positions as well as their speed and directions of motion.  The authors of the study used the database that Gaia produced to identify stars that would be (1) within 300 lightyears of the Sun (2) in a line-of-sight that would allow observation of the Earth traversing the face of the Sun and (3) be in that range between 5000 years ago and 5000 in the future.  At the present time 1715 such stars have satisfied this condition.  In the next 500 year 319 more will enter this range. That’s a lot of stars.  Seven of these are stars where planets have already been detected some of them in the habitable range. So is anybody out there watching us?  It’s unlikely but not impossible.  If you live in a city apartment and don’t draw the blinds it’s possible that someone in a nearby apartment is watching you and you wouldn’t know it.  That’s kind of like our situation as a planet.
