L, Good News! Pennsylvania Democrats Voter Registration Numbers Bounce Back Up From 2020 Lull, poopdogcomedy, 2021-07-01, From the Pennsylvania Capital Star: A quiet spring brings encouraging seeds for Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party. As the first months of the Biden Administration unfolded and COVID cases steadily declined PA Dems recovered from their post-election slump.  Back in February the party held a statewide advantage of 624315. As of June 14 however that margin has improved to 630075. Total registrants are down so counties are still culling their rolls although now this is tending to hurt the GOP instead.  At the moment Pennsylvania has 4057723 Democrats and 3427648 Republicans. For comparison four months ago it was 4074825 Democrats and 3450510 Republicans.

Gov. Tom Wolf said outside his Capitol offices that he considers the measure a voter suppression effort. “I think voter suppression is absolutely the wrong thing to do” Wolf said adding that he would welcome a narrower bill that would give counties more time to start counting ballots and to provide more money to help them run elections. The Republican elections bill developed in large part in response to some GOP voters’ anger over President Donald Trump’s reelection loss would have changed registration deadlines from 15 days to 30 days prior to an election. Mail-in voters would have had an earlier deadline to request ballots. Here’s a little more info: Also: Governor Tom Wolf signed legislation that expands access to medical marijuana in the state. Wolf signed House Bill 1024 on Wednesday. Medical marijuana can now be prescribed for more conditions including cancer remission therapy and issues with the nervous system. The new law also allows patients to get a three-month supply at one time and keeps curbside delivery at marijuana dispenseries. “It’s been five years since Pennsylvania legalized medical marijuana and in that time the Department of Health has examined the program’s successes and challenges and made important recommendations on improving the law” Gov. Wolf said in a release. “This legislation provides important updates to our state’s medical marijuana program to ensure that patients have improved access to medication.” Pennsylvania Democrats aren’t slowing down with voter registration efforts. Received this e-mail yesterday from the Pennsylvania Democratic Party: After COVID-19 put voter registration on ice last year we made signing up voters a top priority in 2021 and launched a plan to register thousands of new Democrats. Now brand new analysis shows Dems have the momentum in statewide registration.

Recent reporting by PA Capital Star shows that halfway through 2021 Dems have out-registered Republicans statewide and in battleground counties like Erie Lancaster and Lehigh. We've even made up some ground in "deep red" counties like Warren! We can't rest on our laurels though. There are still many counties where Republicans have grown their edge since November and our statewide voter advantage is still much smaller than it was a few years ago.
