L, There is only one republican, flycaster, 2021-04-29,  The way I figure it there is one republican and only one that is happy with the latest news cycle. Matt Gaetz. He is out of the public eye. Conspicuously so. So where the fuck is the lil’ maggot? You can’t even find pics of the guy  and he’s never been this quiet the long in his political “career” ever. I mean it’s gotta be fucking hard to hide a melon like that. His forehead alone can be used as a solar energy farm. So where’d he go? Inquiring minds and all that.
