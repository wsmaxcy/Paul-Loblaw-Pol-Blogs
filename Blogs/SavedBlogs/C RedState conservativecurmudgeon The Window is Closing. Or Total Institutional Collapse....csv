C, The Window is Closing. Or: Total Institutional Collapse..., conservativecurmudgeon, 2020-12-18, Any fair-minded person who has done even a cursory look-see at what likely occurred in Wayne Milwaukee Fulton Philadelphia and Maricopa counties can come to a fairly logical conclusion: Voter fraud using the adjudication function of the Dominion Voting System “Democracy Suite” software is breathtakingly easy. But let’s start with a basic truism of human nature: Fair elections are underpinned only by a virtuous electorate: Without broad cultural virtue a fair election is likely illusory anyway without regard to built-in fail-safes. How interested really were Democrat machine cities in performing a fair and transparent election— when their leadership spent four years bawling about Trump and his equivalency to Hitler his tendency toward mass murder his general inhumanity and unfitness for office? What lengths would they go to in order to keep a Hitler a murderer an all-around fiend from continuing to occupy the Oval Office— and in fact from their point of view would not any subterfuge be morally justifiable to prevent this? And wouldn’t we EXPECT them to thus behave? Again any fair person would have to say “well yes.” When I first went into business (now well over a quarter century ago) the first accountant I hired made what what was an obvious aphorism to me now but which seemed repellant at the time: “If you put a petty cash-box out without a key don’t blame your employees when you get ripped off: It’s YOUR fault” she said. “Tempting people is as bad as theft”. Apply this simple wisdom to the general milieu that I wrote about above in this last paragraph: If enraged Democrats in the counties mentioned were persuaded they were doing the Lord’s Work to prevent a second Trump Term… …and you didn’t put a lock on the petty-cash box what —exactly— did you THINK would happen? The lack of a “Lock” is this: several counties now (Antrim Coffey Maricopa etc) are reporting ballot tabulation error rates in excess of 65%. And each of these “errors” or spoiled ballots were sent to supervisory “adjudicators”… If you have a chance look up Eric Cumer (VP of sales for Dominion Systems) or others such as a brave Arizona election official who posted their self-produced phone-video (but whom I prefer to keep nameless) demonstrating how easy it is to change ballot results in real time using scanned ballot images in their Democracy Suite software. Once a ballot reaches an adjudicator it just requires a couple of touches on the screen and votes are changed added or eliminated… Once the ballot image is altered —and it literally takes less than ten seconds— it’s Game Set Match. And if the ballot is truly “spoiled” (wink wink) then it’s the perfect crime… To accomplish this all you need are a few keyed-up righteous AFSCME or NEA members a pot of coffee a box of donuts a couple of black markers a  couple thousand cast ballots from Zuckerberg drop-boxes…and a little extra time on election night… There’s no grand conspiracy here nothing more than human nature— and no lock. A few folks at a metropolitan ballot-processing center —with a deep desire to rid the cosmos of Donald Trump— would just need to fill in BOTH bubbles on a presidential ballot (presumably one that was cast for Trump but even THIS doesn’t matter) and it suddenly has to be “adjudicated”; it’s spoiled. In fact to reach the adjudication computer station all a ballot needs is a simple black marker slash through the presidential bubbles— even if the ballot arrived at the center properly filled out for Trump—all it needed was Guido from Local 4675 to slash his marker through the Trump bubble and it’s off to adjudication… Once there it just takes a couple of clicks by Tony (also from Local 4675) and voila! A Trump vote is now a Biden vote— and both the hard ballot and the ballot image are forever changed: and it is a righteous righteous crime. It’s also why the ballot spoilage and error rates are the smoking gun. In Antrim County in 2016 it was less than 6%. This year it was 68.5%. When there is no lock in the petty-cash box blame yourself when the cash comes up missing… To me it’s clear what occurred in these five counties late at night when these massive vote-spikes were witnessed: communications in addition to human nature can spread nearly instantaneously: “Hey..” one call might have been between Union Members “watch what we can do!” Again blend in the final ingredient of the moral imperative to rid the country of Trump and it becomes obvious. It seems a very analog solution (for them) to a digital problem too. And it becomes the perfect election crime. The window to get to the bottom of this though is only open by a mere crack: and it will shut entirely in a week or two. Heroes are desperately needed in our Senate to hold real serious substantive hearings that compel testimony from people working at the TCF Center In Detroit State Farm Arena and other locales and pin them down: Did they take the petty cash? We understand your moral obligation to rid the country of the Bad Orange Man— so tell us what happened. We’ve thus far heard no sworn public testimony. And if the American public doesn’t get the truth now: when can it ever expect the truth to come out when it’s still relevant? Barring this —and without regard to their actual testimony: after all maybe what I’m alleging didn’t occur— 75 million Americans will not be settled in their hearts and minds that their vote wasn’t stolen …If such is the case: collapse won’t be far behind of some of our most precious institutions. A fair mind can come to few other conclusions.
