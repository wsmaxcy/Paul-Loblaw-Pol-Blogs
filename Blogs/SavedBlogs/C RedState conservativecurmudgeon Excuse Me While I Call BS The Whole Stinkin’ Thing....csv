C, Excuse Me While I Call BS: The Whole Stinkin’ Thing..., conservativecurmudgeon, 2020-11-12, With all due respect to the wonderfully researched and cogently presented series of Diaries here at RedState by the magnificent Scott Hounsell (and I mean that) sometimes it’s important to invoke a couple of well-worn aphorisms: ”You can overlook the pepper when you are looking at the gnat-crap” or ”I can’t see the forest for all these darned trees” …which is to say: On Election Day in 2016 the population of the United States was 324320000 people give or take. Today four years later the population is 330579600– an increase of around 6 million folks or a little less than 2%. And in 2016 exactly 128838342 ballots were cast for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Okay: so far so good. A week ago last Tuesday though a gigantically improbable 150350703 (and still counting) ballots were cast for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden— an increase over the same time period of over 14%. This is what is called in the field of statistical analysis “really weird”—especially when viewed through a somewhat broader lens: In 2012 the population in the US on Election Day was eh call it 314690000. That year about 126854000 folks voted for either Willard Romney or Barack Obama. As I say: The population of voters in the US in the has been increasing around 2% every four years and this natural increase is reflected in the general population growth. This even accounts for the relative aging of the population over time. And according to the exit polls from the election over a week ago the participation for those younger than 25 remained VERY stable from 2016. So: what can account for this enormous and unprecedented increase in the sheer vote totals? Surely not the pandemic: all other human activities in the US have seen monumental drop-offs in participation. If historic norms are applied we should have seen between a 2 and 5 percent increase overall in participation numbers. What gives? I postulate a theory: I think Donald Trump’s publicly acknowledged vote totals are not terribly accurate either and I think the “weighted vote statistical variance” built into EVERY computerized vote tabulating system in America not only “switched” between 2 and 4 million votes from Biden to Trump it added votes; and I further think that a not insignificant amount “calibration” and “system training” votes were also added to the totals inadvertently or not. It causes spastic fits of side-aching guffaws to think that Milwaukee County saw 92% voter participation when cities like Cleveland and Indianapolis saw a more historically comparable 58-62%. Detroit did it’s reliable 60%. Meanwhile just like Milwaukee  jurisdictions like Philadelphia and Atlanta are racking up Saddam Hussein-like levels of participation. And remember: This election was with a presidential incumbent— not an open seat— election: historically these see a plateauing of interest. No no: Something is off. Terribly off. I’m calling BS on the whole thing…
