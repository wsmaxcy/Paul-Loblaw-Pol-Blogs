L, WHOLE. NEW. BALLGAME. ACA enrollment is BACK & it's a #BFD now. Here's 10 key things to know:, Brainwrap, 2021-04-26, NOTE: I’ll be reposting this diary every week or so throughout the 2021 Special Enrollment Period to make sure this information gets to as many people as possible.  All 50 states + DC have re-opened enrollment on their respective ACA exchanges in response to both the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the American Rescue Plan (ARP) which substantially expands and enhances premium subsidies to millions of people! If you've never enrolled in an ACA healthcare policy before or if you looked into it years ago but weren't impressed please give it another shot now. Thanks to the ARP (and some other reasons) it's a whole different ballgame this spring & summer. Here's 10 important things to understand when you #GetCovered: With the passage and signing of the American Rescue Plan the ACA's infamous "Subsidy Cliff" has been killed at last (at least for 2021 & 2022 anyway)! This means two extremely important things: Here's a table laying out the percent of your household income which you're restricted to paying for the benchmark Silver plan in your area under the original ACA formula and the new American Rescue Plan formula: You can also read my more detailed explainer including a bunch of case studies for comparison. The federal exchange (HealthCare.Gov) which hosts 36 states along with a few of the state-based ACA exchanges have already gone live with the ARP-enhanced subsidies...but residents of some of the state exchanges will have to wait a bit longer. The extra subsidies will still be paid in full to ALL eligible current enrollees mind you; they might just not show up on the website when you go to enroll (or if current enrollees visit the site to switch plans) just yet. As of this writing here's where things stand (h/t to Louise Norris for some of this): Most states have re-opened enrollment through 8/15 but the dates vary in some states: It's important to note that in some states it will only be available to those currently uninsured (or enrolled in off-exchange individual market plans). In other words those currently enrolled in an exchange plan may not be able to switch to a different one mid-year. I've whipped up a simple graphic summarizing the status of every state: Once the COVID-19 Enrollment Period ends in your state you won't be eligible to enroll for ACA-compliant major medical coverage for the rest of the year unless you qualify for a 60-day Special Enrollment Period (SEP) due to a qualify life event like losing your employer-provided healthcare coverage getting married/divorced moving giving birth/adopting a child turning 26 or becoming ineligible for Medicaid. There's also some exceptions to this; you can enroll year-round if... There's a ton of junk plans and scam artists out there especially these days. Fraudulent plans are being hawked endlessly via both robocalls spam emails and fly-by-night websites. If you're enrolling online make sure to use one of the official ACA exchange websites: Note: While you could also enroll in ACA-compliant policies directly via the insurance carrier's website I STRONGLY recommend only using the exchange websites listed above. You have to enroll on-exchange to be eligible for financial help! One of the most sickly ironic things about the ACA being in jeopardy due to the federal individual mandate penalty being zeroed out is that there are actually five states which have re-instituted their own healthcare coverage requirement: In CA DC NJ & RI the penalty is pretty much identical to the old federal penalty: Either $695.00 per adult or $347.50 per child in the household or 2.5% of the total household income whichever is greater. Massachusetts uses a different formula. The financial penalty will be charged when residents file their 2020 state taxes in 2021. As I explain in detail here if your household earns less than 200% FPL (around $25500/yr if you're single; around $52000/yr for a family of four) make sure to choose a Silver plan! Thanks to the ACA's Cost Sharing Reductions (CSR) system you'll receive additional financial help which will lower your deductible co-pays and coinsurance so much it effectively transforms Silver plans into Platinum plans! Furthermore thanks to the American Rescue Plan the premiums for these "Secret Platinum" plans are literally nothing for anyone earning under 150% FPL and max out at just 2% of your annual income from 150 - 200% FPL! NORMALLY once you've chosen an ACA exchange plan you're stuck with that exact same plan for the rest of the year unless you have a "Qualifying Life Event" which gives you a limited time to make a change. HOWEVER residents of most states (not all) are being allowed to switch plans during the ongoing 2021 COVID Special Enrollment Period due to the enhanced ARP subsidies. The table I posted at #2 above notes which states are and aren't allowing current enrollees to move to a different plan. If you're in a state which lets you do so I strongly recommend checking into it. Some insurance carriers in some states are even giving people credit for whatever portion of their deductible and other out-of-pocket expenses they've already paid into when they move to a different plan with the same carrier. Therefore I'll say it again: SHOP AROUND! One particular provision of the American Rescue Plan gets a little wonky but it could be critically important for hundreds of thousands of people living in the 12 states which have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (Alabama Florida Georgia Kansas Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas and Wyoming (Wisconsin hasn't expanded Medicaid either but is a special case). The short version is that under the ARP for 2021 only anyone who receives unemployment benefits will be considered to have an income of 133% of the Federal Poverty Level even if they actually earn less than that...or for that matter more than that. This means that someone in a "Medicaid Gap" state (where adults who earn less than 100% FPL are normally not eligible for either Medicaid or ACA subsidies) will be legally authorized to be treated as if they earn 133% FPL...and therefore will be eligible for 100% APTC subsidies. In other words Americans receiving unemployment insurance this year only will be eligible for a $0-premium Silver plan and will also be eligible for high Cost Sharing Reduction assistance which bring their deductibles co-pays and other out of pocket expenses down dramatically. The effect of this is that they'll be eligible for the equivalent of a "Platinum Plus" ACA policy which covers 94% of the average enrollee's medical expenses (Platinum plans cover 90%; Gold 80%; Silver normally covers 70% and Bronze covers 60%). This won't resolve the Medicaid Gap completely but it should provide comprehensive extremely low-cost coverage for a huge chunk of the 2.2 million people caught in the Gap. oh and as part of this... I hate to end this on a down note but it would be wrong of me not to remind folks that yes there's still a pending anti-ACA lawsuit decision expected to be announced sometime this spring or summer by the U.S. Supreme Court. I've written about the details (and how idiotic the case is) too many times to remember...and for the average person none of that matters. What matters to them is whether the SCOTUS strikes down the law and when they're gonna announce their decision. As bad as the Worst Case Scenario would be keep in mind that it's not a sure thing by any means even with a 6-3 conservative SCOTUS. During oral arguments in the case last November even ACA-hating Justice Alito seemed extremely skeptical about the plaintiff's case while Chief Justice Roberts and Trump appointee Kavanaugh both seemed extremely inclined to lean towards "severability"...that is even if they rule that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional there's a very strong chance that they'd simply require the mandate language itself to be stricken leaving the rests of the law as is. Heck even Trump's final appointee Amy Coney Barrett had already shot down the exact same argument in a mock trial of this exact case before she was appointed to the Supreme Court. So...there's a good chance that either the entire ACA (or 99.9% of it) will be spared. That's not a guarantee of course; anything can still happen which is why I've been urging Congress to #MootTheSuit. It's also not necessarily a binary decision. SCOTUS could potentially kick the case back down the ladder to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals again in which case it might bounce around between the Circuit and SCOTUS for another year or two. Who knows? In any event keep in mind that even in a worst-case scenario (which would be horrific) no one who signs up for ACA exchange coverage during the current COVID Enrollment Period will be any worse off than they are right now; don't let this possibility discourage you from enrolling now. Even a few months of coverage is still better than no coverage at all.
