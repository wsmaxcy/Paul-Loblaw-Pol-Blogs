L, What's in a name?, 4longyears, 2021-07-01, You have probably read by now that yesterday Lauren Boebert tweeted that the “easiest way to make the Delta variant go away is to turn off CNN”. She apparently forgot to keep up with COVID stats in her own district. Or just flat ignored the fact that Mesa County (in her district) has a COVID incidence of around 30 cases per 100K and that roughly half of Mesa County’s cases are due to the delta variant. Strangely enough her tweet was deleted shortly thereafter. Here’s the kicker. Guess what the name of one county adjacent to Mesa County is. Yep you nailed it. It’s DELTA COUNTY!! Delta County has a vaccination rate even lower than that of Mesa County both in the vicinity of 30%. I’m sorry good citizens of Delta County but you people are obviously doomed. And it’s not just due to a serious COVID issue...
