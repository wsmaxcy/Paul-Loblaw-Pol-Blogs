L, Local Arizona Native Organizers for the Win–2022 Elections, MissaNEAZ, 2021-04-20,      On May 9th 2021 we are launching the Family Votes Program and getting local organizers back to work on Apache Hopi and Navajo lands in Arizona. The 2022 elections are every bit as consequential for Native Voters as the 2020 races and we need to invest in tribal communities now. Our Family Votes program will cost $65000 to start early mobilizing efforts this summer.      Arizona voters must defend Mark Kelly’s U.S. Senate seat Tom O’ Halleran’s (CD-01) U.S. House seat and every statewide office down ballot. Investment into the Family Votes Program will go toward hiring four full time organizers on three sovereign nations; Hopi White Mountain Apache and Navajo Nations. We have the talent and playbook from 2020 and we know how to strategically operate in the pandemic. Our team is more than ready especially now that Republicans are pushing every voter suppression they can conjure up to prevent Indigenous and Black and Brown voters from casting their ballot.      Daily Kos readers generously contributed to our 2020 Native organizing campaign and we secured a win for the Democrats with early and direct local investment. We need your support again. Our fundraising goal for April is $10000; this will cover initial field team costs for May.  We have the talent  Let’s keep up the momentum  On the ballot  $65000 will reach thousands of Native and rural voters in Arizona   To keep the U.S. House and Senate and ensure every Native and rural voter has equal access to the polls in 2022 we need to engage voters now. Too much is at stake. Please donate to our Family Votes - Native Organizing Fund today.
