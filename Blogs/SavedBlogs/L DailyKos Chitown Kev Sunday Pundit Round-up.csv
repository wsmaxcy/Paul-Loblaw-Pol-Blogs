L, Sunday Pundit Round-up, Chitown Kev, 2021-05-02, Good morning everyone. I have a note this morning on my coverage of foreign policy here in the pundit round-ups. If I have learned nothing else since beginning the increased coverage of foreign policy and diplomacy issues it’s that those issues are very complex with stories that have contradictory points of view. It is my hope that the links and readings that I provide here reflect that complexity. Insofar as story links may (or may not) reflect my own views...I don’t believe in a Manichean world view of foreign policy; I never have. I believe all nation- state “actors” (non-state actors is a bit more complex of a subject) take actions and practice diplomacy out of various degrees of self-interest (i.e. beefing up alliances) and altruism. In many cases I don’t have a problem with that. It’s simply the way states frequently under various sets of conditions. That includes the United States. It includes other great and regional and emerging powers like yes China and yes India (IMO India Japan Germany and possibly Brazil all deserve permanent seats on the UN Security Council) and yes Russia. I try my best not to play favorites (although I do make judgments) and don’t expect me to. Now it is time for pundits. Robert Anglen of the Arizona Republic reports that election experts have increasingly called for the federal monitoring of the election shenanigans in Maricopa County.  Citing violations of voting and election laws representatives of the Brennan Center for Justice the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Protect Democracy urged the Department of Justice to protect ballots and prevent voter intimidation. "Ballots that are protected under federal law are in imminent danger of being stolen defaced or irretrievably damaged and Arizona citizens are in imminent danger of being subject to unlawful voter intimidation"  the four security specialists wrote in the April 29 letter. The Senate and private contractors hired to conduct the recount failed to ensure the physical security of ballots by keeping doors unlocked and allowing unauthorized persons to access the ballot storage facility at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum the specialists wrote. "We believe that the Senate and its agents ... are violating their duty under federal law to retain and preserve ballots cast in a federal election" the specialists wrote. "They also risk compromising the integrity of the ballots themselves using materials and technologies that will cause the ballot paper and marks to deteriorate." Nick Corasaniti of the New York Times writes about the increasing Republican calls for poll intimidators watchers. As Republican lawmakers in major battleground states seek to make voting harder and more confusing through a web of new election laws they are simultaneously making a concerted legislative push to grant more autonomy and access to partisan poll watchers — citizens trained by a campaign or a party and authorized by local election officials to observe the electoral process. This effort has alarmed election officials and voting rights activists alike: There is a long history of poll watchers being used to intimidate voters and harass election workers often in ways that target Democratic-leaning communities of color and stoke fears that have the overall effect of voter suppression. During the 2020 election President Donald J. Trump’s campaign repeatedly promoted its “army” of poll watchers as he publicly implored supporters to venture into heavily Black and Latino cities and hunt for voter fraud. Republicans have offered little evidence to justify a need for poll watchers to have expanded access and autonomy. As they have done for other election changes — including reduced early voting stricter absentee ballot requirements and limits on drop boxes — they have grounded their reasoning in arguments that their voters want more secure elections. That desire was born in large part out of Mr. Trump’s repeated lies about last year’s presidential contest which included complaints about insufficient poll watcher access. Renée Graham of the Boston Globe notes that overall the Republicans keep piling on little lies on top of big lies on top of The Big Lie. Yet even when the lies are debunked the damage is already done. And that’s the goal. These mistruths have a social media afterlife unencumbered by facts. It’s about lies fashioned to reinforce ideology and confirmation biases. Harris didn’t put copies of her book into migrant centers for profit but for those who already dislike her it sounds like the kind of calculated thing they imagine she would do. Biden isn’t taking away meat seafood or eggs but it sounds like the sort of nanny-state nonsense that conservatives often accuse Democrats of concocting to curtail American freedoms and independence. Taken at face value it all seems silly even harmless. Yet that obscures the darker underside of these constant falsehoods. Sam Wang and Ari Goldbloom-Helzer of The Atlantic shows why that if the filibuster is kept in place in the United States Senate legislation will continue to slow to a crawl once it reaches that chamber.  Because neither party can reliably elect enough senators to overcome a filibuster modern American politics is trapped in a Zone of Legislative Death: more than 50 seats enough to select a majority leader; fewer than 60 seats not enough to pass legislation. This zone is extremely difficult to escape. We calculated just how difficult. Senators are elected by popular vote meaning we can determine how many voters each major party represents. We added up the votes cast in the most recent election of all 100 senators. The result is a national popular vote spread over several years. In the current Senate whose members were elected in 2016 2018 and 2020 the 50 Democratic-caucusing senators including independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King received 52.4 percent of the vote while the 50 Republican senators received 47.6 percent. What share of the vote would either party have needed to reach a filibuster-proof 60 seats? By shifting the vote in each of the 100 elections by the same number of percentage points until Democrats or Republicans were ahead in 60 races we found that Democrats would have needed to win 55.8 percent of the national vote. Republicans would have needed to win only 50.2 percent of the vote to escape the zone—barely a popular majority at all. David Ignatius of the Washington Post says that if President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan becomes the law of the land it will fundamentally change American politics. Here’s a crisp summary of the agenda for change: “Capitalism must be modified to do a better job of creating a healthier society one that is more inclusive and creates more opportunity for more people.” That didn’t come from Biden but from Jamie Dimon the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase in a 2020 article for Time magazine. Dimon continued with language that might have been a draft of the president’s speech to Congress. He called for “meaningful changes like rebuilding our education system and providing skills training affordable health care policies substantial infra­structure investment and sensible immigration reform and climate policies.” For all the nice words from Dimon and other business leaders it will be difficult transitioning to an economy in which the returns to labor and capital are more balanced. As digital technology accelerates business there are increasing returns to success. The smartest and most nimble are rewarded and the gap between business leaders and business laggards widens. Biden will be swimming against this quickening current with his progressive agenda. Christina Lu writes for Foreign Policy magazine that the United States should and at local levels is beginning to embrace notions of transitional justice. The United States has yet to fully embrace transitional justice on a federal level but these kinds of measures aren’t entirely new either. In some states certain transitional justice measures have already been—or are in the process of being—adopted.  Maryland for instance has established a Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate and bring justice to those impacted by racial lynchings. And in March Evanston Illinois approved reparations for eligible Black residents that suffered under discriminatory housing policies between 1919 and 1969.  Nationally strides have also been made in this direction. In June 2020 Rep. Barbara Lee introduced a bill to establish a Commission on Truth Racial Healing and Transformation. The bill is meant to help “understand [the] racial discrimination imbalance in this country … [and] actually establish that throughline that threads and helps to explain how what happened then affects us today” Zvobgo said.  But since places have different historical legacies there is no one-size-fits-all recipe. The specifics of transitional justice depend on the place—and context.  Judith Warner of the New York Times reports that the American Psychiatric Association is taking a big step in confronting its racist past.  This weekend the A.P.A. is devoting its annual meeting to the theme of equity. Over the course of the three-day virtual gathering of as many as 10000 participants the group will present the results of its yearlong effort to educate its 37000 mostly white members about the psychologically toxic effects of racism both in their profession and in the lives of their patients. Dr. Jeffrey Geller the A.P.A.’s outgoing president made that effort the signature project of his one-year term of office. “This is really historic” he said in a recent interview. “We’ve laid a foundation for what should be long-term efforts and long-term change.” Dr. Cheryl Wills a psychiatrist who chaired a task force exploring structural racism in psychiatry said the group’s work could prove life-changing for a new generation of Black psychiatrists who will enter the profession with a much greater chance of knowing that they are valued and seen. She recalled the isolation she experienced in her own early years in medicine and the difficulty she has had in finding other Black psychiatrists to whom she can refer patients. Meenakishi Narula Ahamed writes for CNN that India’s efforts to become a player in the “vaccine diplomacy” scene left the country vulnerable to the enormous surge in cases that it is experiencing now. Madhukar Pai and Manu Prakash of the Washington Post notes that the coronavirus crisis in India is beginning to affect the entire region. India has 95000 intensive care beds and 48000 ventilators. By mid-May it is projected that the country will need 340000 beds and more than 700000 ventilators. Rural India has few of these and is already hit hard. India needs the global community’s support to survive this crisis. Even as India struggles to get the second wave under control cases are surging among India’s neighbors including Nepal Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. While the exact variant driving the new surges among India’s neighbors is unclear the B.1.617 variant has already spread to more than 18 countries. Other countries in South Asia have far less resources and medical infrastructure compared with India. Nepal for example has 1486 ICU beds and 634 ventilators  and Nepal’s health ministry is anticipating a need to treat 15000 ICU patients by July. Bangladesh home to 163 million people has only 1134 covid-19 ICU beds. Pakistan the fifth-largest country in the world has fewer than 4000 ventilators. India’s neighbors can ill afford the kind of devastation India is experiencing. More from Sumit Ganguly of the Washington Post on the leadership failures of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It's not like Modi doesn't know how to lead ably. In his first term in office he initiated welfare programs ranging from educating girls to ending public defecation across the country. Launched with considerable fanfare these programs won over a number of his critics who grudgingly conceded that they were worthwhile endeavors and could demonstrate the efficacy of government. Five years later the disorganized and ideologically incoherent opposition all but guaranteed Modi a second term. But a haughty out-of-touch approach has always been evident too — and it is the hallmark of the government’s coronavirus response. Without consulting public health experts or epidemiologists Modi imposed a draconian nationwide lockdown with just a few hours’ notice leaving millions of migrant workers stranded hundreds of miles from their homes. This 21-day shutdown briefly impeded the spread of the virus but the prime minister did not use the opportunity to plot against its eventual resurgence. Instead of using the respite to build up stocks of personal protective equipment boost vaccine production or ramp up testing he returned to a business-as-usual governance. He and his alter ego Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah focused their energies on caricaturing opposition politicians harassing political dissidents and claiming at a World Economic Forum meeting that India had crushed the virus. As four of the country’s states went to the polls for legislative elections Modi threw himself into full campaign mode attending rallies without any prospect of social distancing and with mostly unmasked supporters. (Not to be outdone some opposition parties followed suit.) Modi has also allowed a massive Hindu religious festival to be held in Haridwar a city on the Ganges. This festival the Kumbh Mela routinely attracts more than 1 million pilgrims and can last three months. The political appeal of permitting this festival was obvious: It would virtually guarantee him and his party the votes of the Hindu faithful. Alex Ward of Vox writes on an interesting reason that Joe Biden might be staying on The Former Guy’s route concerning North Korea...and other foreign policy matters. When Biden announced that US troops would be leaving Afghanistan he noted that one reason for his decision was that former President Trump made a deal with the Taliban that a full withdrawal would happen. “It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself but it was an agreement made by the United States government and that means something” the president said. Biden may have come to a similar conclusion here. In 2018 Trump met with Kim in Singapore and signed a declaration which stated they would “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” That may not be the formulation Biden would like but it is the latest US-North Korea deal on the books and so he may have honored that. Anything else would look like a unilateral backtrack in the diplomatic process experts said. “It’s the right formulation to use because both sides agreed to it” said Vipin Narang an expert on North Korea’s nuclear program at MIT. South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in also adopted this phrase in his yearslong efforts to broker a deal between Pyongyang and Washington. He supported it in an April interview with the New York Times noting that it was “clearly an achievement” for Trump and Kim to have met in Singapore and signed an agreement. For years international newspapers and foreign policy journals have raved and worried about the progress that China has made in becoming a player in the international arena. So when some like Audrye Wong of Foreign Affairs says to not believe all of the hype about China; that China struggles in the international arena that it doesn’t get everything that it wants...I listen...and read...and learn. But a close look reveals that China’s record is far less impressive than often thought. For one thing its attempts at economic statecraft have often sparked resistance. In many of the 60-plus countries receiving BRI investment even in those most eager for Chinese investment officials have complained of shoddy construction inflated costs and environmental degradation. Beijing has been forced to go on the defensive with Chinese President Xi Jinping taking pains to emphasize the importance of “high-quality” and “reasonably priced” projects. Many countries have demanded reciprocal access to the Chinese market; others have bowed out of Chinese initiatives altogether and are seeking financing elsewhere. China has managed to massively expand its economic presence beyond its borders but so far it has failed to turn it into long-term strategic influence. The Chinese economy exerts a strong gravitational pull but as Beijing is discovering that does not necessarily mean that other countries are altering their political orbits.
