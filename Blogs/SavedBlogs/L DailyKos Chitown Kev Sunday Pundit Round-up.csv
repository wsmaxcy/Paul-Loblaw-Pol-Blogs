L, Sunday Pundit Round-up, Chitown Kev, 2021-05-09, Good morning and Happy Mother’s Day to everyone! Lisa Lerer of the New York Times writes about the iron grip that The Damn Fool still has on the Republican Party. The loyalty to the former president persists despite his role in inciting his supporters ahead of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol with his adherents either ignoring redefining or in some cases tacitly accepting the deadly attack on Congress. “We’ve just gotten so far afield from any sane construction” said Barbara Comstock a longtime party official who was swept out of her suburban Virginia congressional seat in the 2018 midterm backlash to Mr. Trump. “It’s a real sickness that is infecting the party at every level. We’re just going to say that black is white now.” Yet as Republicans wrap themselves in the fantasy of a stolen election Democrats are anchored in the day-to-day business of governing a nation that is still struggling to emerge from a deadly pandemic. Strategists from both parties say that discordant dynamic — two parties operating in two different realities — is likely to define the country’s politics for years to come. At the same time President Biden faces a broader challenge: what to do about the large segment of the public that doubts his legitimacy and a Republican Party courting the support of that segment by pushing bills that would restrict voting and perhaps further undermine faith in future elections. The Washington Post’s Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey write about the reemergence of Trump as the leader of the Republican Party. Six months removed from his Election Day loss Trump has emerged from his West Palm Beach hibernation — refashioning himself as the president of the Republican States of America and reshaping the party in ways both micro and macro. He has also privately revived his claims that he plans to run for president again in 2024 decrying what he views as the “low ratings” of the Biden administration said one person who has spoken with Trump recently. He rails that President Biden is “a disaster” and argues that “Joe isn’t in charge everybody knows it’s Kamala” — a preview of his likely message portraying Biden as an unwitting stooge of Vice President Harris this person said. Nonetheless Trump is not expected to make an official decision or announcement until after the midterm elections an adviser said. Trump’s reappearance is fueled by an ego-driven desire to remain at the center of national attention said former advisers and allies who are in touch with him. The defeated ex-president is propelled primarily by a thirst for retribution an insatiable quest for the spotlight and a desire to establish and maintain total dominance and control over the Republican base said several former senior White House advisers. He has boasted to some in his orbit that he expects a book deal at some point though there is no known offer two advisers said. Former chief of staff for Bill Clinton Mike McLarty writes for Roll Call on the complete “erosion of political comity” in today’s politics. The erosion of political comity was on display for the entire world on Jan. 6 when a mob invaded the Capitol in a bid to overturn the results of a free and fair election. Not since the British burned Washington in the War of 1812 had our institutions of government suffered so direct an assault. The events of Jan. 6 weren’t simply an attack on a building but an attack on democracy itself. At the same time we have seen a number of peaceful protests that have evolved into riots and destruction of private property many times adversely impacting small-business owners ignoring the rule of law and respect for others properties. These types of incidents weaken our democracy as well. What led us to this point? Over the past few decades an alternative political playbook has emerged. The new playbook short-circuits the role of consensus building in American politics and replaces it with partisanship power politics and at times outright hostility toward the opposition. In retrospect we’ve seen the building blocks of this new brand of politics fall into place piece by piece over the last few decades.   Gerrymandering once frowned upon created congressional districts that are little more than party strongholds. With the winner of the dominant party’s primary destined to win the general election candidates have little incentive to reach out beyond their political base to broaden their appeal. Emily Stewart of Vox writes about that latest job report. It’s hard to argue that the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ April jobs report was good — not to mention that the jobs numbers from March were revised down as well meaning the economy actually added fewer jobs that month than initially reported. But it also reinforces something that’s been true throughout the pandemic: A lot of what’s going on in the economy is just going to be completely unpredictable. Plenty of people would not have expected a housing boom a chicken wing shortage or a run on lumber either. “Sometimes we overcomplicate situations by thinking that we should have thorough understandings of them when actually a great deal of humility is called for when we’re talking about unprecedented situations” said Mark Hamrick senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “We want for the most part to cheer for the end of the pandemic and the end of the economic downturn and so it’s easy to get caught up in a tsunami of hope and optimism but the economy has to do its own work to heal.” The American economy lost 22 million jobs in March and April 2020 and it’s still 8 million jobs short of where it was pre-pandemic. While the Covid-19 vaccine is now widely available and more than half of American adults have had at least one shot the virus is still a dangerous threat and millions more people need to be vaccinated. It feels almost inevitable that putting the country back together is going to take place in fits and starts — and some pieces of the puzzle might never fit back together. Andrew Joseph of STATnews warns that even as the worst of the pandemic seems to be subsiding (at least in the United States) mental illnesses and anxieties due to the pandemic might not subside any time soon. As the pandemic set in last March the percentage of people reporting they felt anxious or depressed spiked and has remained elevated since according to survey data. Experts have also highlighted increases in sleeping problems and alcohol and other substance misuse and point to clear causes: Uncertainty and fear about the coronavirus itself; job loss and housing and food insecurity; juggling working from home while dealing with cooped-up kids; grief and a loss of social cohesion as a result of restrictions. The question is what comes next. During emergencies some people take on the mentality of just needing to get through it. When they have though the full weight of what they’ve been through can hit. “At what point do we get to breathe?” said Theresa Nguyen the chief program officer at Mental Health America. “And when you breathe that’s when grief and processing can start to enter your mind.” Mental health researchers have studied the impact of disasters emergencies and health crises for decades going back to the 1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire in Boston that killed nearly 500 people said Carol North a psychiatrist and director of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center’s Division of Trauma and Disaster. (The exception is wars which have been investigated in various ways for hundreds of years.) That historical perspective provides the framework for how experts think about tail effects but the pandemic has been unprecedented. Tavleen Singh of Indian Express wonders if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will ever take the horrific pandemic surge in India seriously. Now is a chance to rebuild public healthcare from scratch. But this cannot happen if the Prime Minister and his Covid team remain in denial about the horrific realities ordinary people are dealing with. It is very bad in the cities but it is going to get much worse in rural India. Already reports are coming in from villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar of people dying of ‘breathlessness’ before they can be taken to the nearest district hospital. This is just the beginning. The Prime Minister needs to urgently put together a new team in which there should be chief ministers of every political party along with scientists and doctors so that a national policy can be made to deal with what is the worst crisis India has ever faced. But first he needs to acknowledge that his old team has failed abysmally. Modi has always boasted of his image as a strong and decisive leader. This is the time for him to prove that he is. For now every time he appears virtually on our screens and gives one of his speeches he sounds as if he has been fooled by his admirers and his social media army to believe that the horror stories are lies. Is this why he has shown more empathy for BJP workers in Bengal than for people dying without oxygen in hospitals? Is this why he has not ordered his ministers and MPs to go into their constituencies and help those who are in desperate need? Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian writes that after taking another pounding in local elections that maybe the Labour Party needs to get a little joe Biden-style leadership in their life. There is no shortage of diagnosis for the defeat in Hartlepool. Plenty credit the “vaccine bounce” arguing with some merit that the pandemic has frozen politics. One pollster who conducted a focus group of ex-Labour voters in the north-west this week summarises the mood this way: “It’s like when your boiler breaks down. You don’t want an argument over who’s to blame you just want it fixed.” Johnson gets credit for sorting out jabs; and for now no one is listening to Keir Starmer. Other explanations break along factional lines. The Corbynites say Labour is paying the price for abandoning a programme that was popular noting that the party held Hartlepool in 2017 and 2019. Witness Richard Burgon’s insistence that Labour’s recent manifestos were “backed by a large majority of voters” the former shadow minister apparently unaware of the outcome of the last two general elections. Meanwhile the anti-Corbynites blame “long Corbyn” claiming that the loathing of the ex-leader that they encountered in 2019 – and which Lord Ashcroft’s post-election survey found to be the number one reason for Labour voters switching to the Tories – lives on. *** The Labour MP Jon Cruddas says his party should be looking at Joe Biden who has proved able to bridge the divide between the young urban left and the traditional Democratic base by focusing on work. Biden casts every measure including on the climate crisis in terms of creating millions of well-paid unionised jobs – and that’s a message both kinds of Democrat can get behind. Kay-Alexander Scholz of DW reports that Germany’s Green Party has surged into the first position to head Germany’s next government largely on the strength of Green Party’s Annalena Baerbock’s surge into the most popular national politician in Germany. For now. Germany's governing "Grand Coalition" between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) currently does not have the support from a majority of voters according to the latest Deutschlandtrend poll. Like other surveys over the past two weeks Deutschlandtrend now sees the Green party in the first position at 26% as the CDU/CSU continues to lose support and has fallen to a mere 23% and the SPD have come in at only 14%. The new situation in the polls can be linked to individual politicians: If German voters could decide directly who should succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor in September 28% would vote for the Greens' chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock.  Conservative CDU/CSU candidate Armin Laschet lags behind on 21%. Even among conservative CDU/CSU voters only half said they'd vote for Laschet. SPD candidate Finance Minister and current Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz scooped up 21% of support from all people surveyed. Of the three chancellor candidates Baerbock is seen as the most likable and credible. SPD's Scholz however is deemed to be the strongest leader of the three. In the evaluation of her political work Baerbock has jumped a massive 41 percentage points in the last month to catch up with Scholz. Catherine Gurtin writes for the South China Morning Post writes about the plight of working mothers in Hong Kong specifically but also around the world The Covid-19 pandemic has seen many working mums including myself and other members of the PathFinders team struggle to balance the demands of work childcare and home-based learning. It is so disheartening to read headlines across the world about the number of mums leaving the workforce due to the pressure of trying to be just as productive at work while ensuring children are doing school work. Given limited care options for children in Hong Kong many working mums have relied heavily on the support of migrant domestic workers especially during the pandemic to be able to remain employed and better balance work and family life. The same reliance is true for working daughters many of whom hire migrant domestic workers to help care for elderly parents. Many of these domestic helpers are working mums too who have been unable to return home during the pandemic to see their children. For many the pandemic has also created an even greater financial burden and increased the need to send home more remittances to support their extended family. Finally this Mother’s Day morning Elizabeth Wellington of the Philadelphia Inquirer writes about that most troublesome topic: grace In a year when falling down and getting up has been a running theme in our lives grace is infusing the zeitgeist with tenderness and strength. It crosses all the lines of the traumas that envelop us: the pandemic social injustice our divided politics. These days — both the devout and the secular — are defining grace as permission to treat ourselves and one another with mercy as we work our way through the drama of what has become our daily reality. “Grace goes beyond self-care and treating yourself” said the Rev. Charles Howard the University of Pennsylvania chaplain. “It’s extending kindness to others and yourself even when it’s not deserving.” Grace is offering a soft place to land. “It gives us permission to just be” Howard said. Everyone have a great morning.
