L, USAA and Tucker Carlson…, Trod348, 2021-06-29, An open letter to USAA CEO Wayne Peacock about USAA advertising on Fox New and Tucker Carlson following Carlson's recent comments denigrating the military and also the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley… Wayne Peacock CEO USAA Sir Let me introduce myself. I am a retired USAF officer and Fighter Pilot with over 20 years of active duty military service...including service in two wars. I am also a loyal USAA member and have been for over 49 years. That said I want to file a complaint and register my disgust about USAA's advertising on Fox News and Tucker Carlson. Comments made by Carlson and the editorial positions taken by Fox News as a whole over the past few months have debased and denigrated the service of all military members and the honor of the US military as a whole. Carlson's comments are pure lies intended to weaken the American public's trust in OUR military. I swore an oath to defend our Constitution and nation and that oath still stands. USAA should stand up for the same truths and ideals that our members have sworn to uphold with their lives and service. Integrity and service should override the financial "bottom line". USAA should not financially support people and a corporation that actively tear down all that we as USAA members stand for. It is a slap in OUR faces for USAA to actively fund this propaganda. (Name redacted) Lt Col USAF (ret.)USAA member # XXXXX (since 1972)USAA
