C, The Walt Disney Company:  Dismayed by America inspired by China, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-05-11, Leaked documents  show that the Walt Disney Company has asked employees to complete a “white privilege checklist” and to “pivot away from “white dominant culture.” The documents published by  Christopher Rufo state (falsely) that the recent killings of George Floyd Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans are “part of a long history of systemic racism and transphobia.” The documents also cover such topics as “white privilege” “white fragility” “white saviors” “microaggressions” and “antiracism.” The documents suggest that employees reflect on the diversity of their personal and professional networks. Employees should also consider how other dimensions of their identities “give (or do not give) you access and advantage.” Furthermore workers are encouraged to “work through feelings of guilt shame and defensiveness to understand what is beneath them and what needs to be healed.” Employees are discouraged from questioning or debating the lived experiences of their black colleagues or from asking those colleagues to educate them about racism since such discussions can be “emotionally taxing.” As if wallowing in unwarranted feelings of guilt and shame isn’t. Disney has passed judgment on America. America has come up short — way short. We’re chronic racists and homophobes. We need to deal with our guilt and shame. If our racism prevents us from feeling guilty and ashamed then we need to be pressured and probably coerced into experiencing these sentiments. Disney seems like a tough grader. Is there any nation that meets its exacting standards? Why yes. China does. Bob Iger Chairman and former CEO of the Walt Disney Company has  said he’s “inspired by China’s vision.” In remarks at the National Committee on US-China Relations (NCUSCR) gala in 2011 Iger stated: 
We’ve also worked hard to establish a number of mutually beneficial relationships with many officials throughout China. We’re inspired by their vision and we’re grateful that they share many of our beliefs including one about the importance of intellectual property protection. I’ve watched China emerge into a global economic force an inspiring source of great innovation offering opportunities that we see as virtually unlimited and the Walt Disney company has certainly been increasing its presence in that vast country.
 China is a ruthless dictatorship. It  systematically oppresses its Uighur (Muslim) population more than one million of whom are  said to be held in concentration camps.  I very much doubt that any Disney employee has oppressed a minority group member. At worst a few might have committed a “microaggression” whatever that means. Yet Disney’s chairman is inspired by China and contemptuous of America and his white employees. Is there a disconnect here? On the surface yes.  But at a deeper level maybe it hangs together. For one thing Disney’s critique of America echoes China’s as set forth recently in its recent  confrontation with our Secretary of State.  More fundamentally the Red Chinese are masters of reeducating members of the bourgeoisie. During its cultural revolution China perfected the art of making them feel guilty and ashamed. Now it is reeducating its Muslims.  In its own way the Disney Company seems to be following suit. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
