L, The Inoculation Project 4/25/2021: Lesson-Building Software and a Digital Microscope, belinda ridgewoodforThe Inoculation Project, 2021-04-25, This week we’re helping two North Carolina teachers with resources that work in the classroom or online. One needs innovative software for developing lessons; the other needs a digital microscope that can share its video anywhere students are. We hope that readers who support quality public school education will help by sharing or supporting our featured projects. The Inoculation Project is an ongoing volunteer effort to crowdfund science and math projects for red-state public schools in low-income neighborhoods. As always our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that facilitates tax-deductible donations to specific vetted projects in public schools. I hadn’t planned to do another week of all-North Carolina projects — this one just looked so interesting! Wade is a very small town indeed that sits not far outside Fayetteville. The large military installation the teacher refers to is Fort Bragg. Resources:  Help me give my students flexibility and independence in their learning with the power of the Nearpod platform. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  District No 7 Elementary School Wade North Carolina Total:  $196.66 Still Needed:  $196.66   $121.66 Teacher’s Comments from Mrs. Price: My Students:  Our small rural school sits on the outskirts of a large military installation. My students come from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and many of them have parents who are active-duty military. My students are kind yet curious and ambitious. They are keen to learn about the world around them both near and far and are excited by unique opportunities to learn. We try to provide opportunities to engage in the world from our classroom as many of the families of our students are not economically poised to provide opportunities outside of our rural community. While we gradually make our return to in-person learning we do not want to lose sight of the important gains we have made in the use of technology and becoming 21st century learners! My Project:  Nearpod is a powerful platform that allows teachers to build interactive lessons and activities within one resource. Notes resources links videos and activities can all be easily compiled into one Nearpod lesson so that students can work simultaneously with the teacher with small groups or independently. It is a great way to engage students in 21st century learning. While we all hope that the COVID-19 pandemic is winding down snow days and other unpredictable weather events make the need for students to have the capability to work at home more critical than ever! One of the few benefits of the pandemic is that the students at our school now have a 1:1 ratio of computers to students. Digital learning is now a tool that we can use daily in our 21st century classrooms and Nearpod is a perfect addition to our array of digital tools. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!  Well to the south at another rural North Carolina school our longer-term project is for a never-before-funded teacher of sixth-grade science. We made some good progress on this last week! Resources:  Help me give my students this awesome digital microscope that will skyrocket them to great science heights. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  Williams Township School Whiteville North Carolina Total:  $631.29 Still Needed:  $347.29  Completed! Thank you! Teacher’s Comments from Coach Watts: My Students:  I teach sixth grade science and social studies at a K-8th grade school in rural North Carolina. I love the enthusiasm that my students have when learning something new in science. I would love to be able to provide a more hands on lab to improve the depth of their understanding. My Project:  This digital microscope will be great for helping my students explore a variety of objects and specimens more in depth than with the human eye. This microscope will allow me to display the live video of the specimens that we are looking at under the microscope. I cannot wait for my kids to be able to see the microscope views on the SMART Board. This microscope will also take still photos or video of the views from the microscope when we make new discoveries. I would be able to share the videos with my virtual students who are not currently in school. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!    Our main project from last week was completed with a big assist from our readers! Ms. Sheffield needed some new books for her North Carolina second grade to help all her students find books they’d enjoy regardless of their widely-varying reading levels. The project was We Love Reading! As I write the project is quite newly-completed and Ms. Sheffield hasn’t seen it yet. We’ll bring you her note when she posts it.  Back in 2018 Mrs. Clark in Slidell Louisiana had funded an Aerogarden hydroponic gardening kit through an earlier project and now she needed new supplies for her current 4th-grade class to use with it plus a camera to allow the students to document their gardening project. The project was Picture Perfect Garden. (More photos at the link.)  Thank you so very much to all my donors. The camera and film have been amazing so far. The students have been able to snap pictures of our herbs growing in our Aerogarden. The camera and film also made it possible for them to document the growth of each herb and use the pictures in our science journal as data while we are learning about the specific needs of plants. Being able to see the picture immediately allows us to see the changes from week to week. Student engagement has been at an all time high. They can not wait to observe the herbs and document the growth by snapping pictures. We are so very grateful for your donations and interest in my students.  Founded in 2009 The Inoculation Project combats the anti-science push in conservative America by funding science and math projects in red-state classrooms and libraries. Our conduit is DonorsChoose.org a crowdfunding charity founded in 2000 and highly rated by both Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau. Every Sunday we focus on helping to fund science or math projects preferably in neighborhood public schools where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income households. We welcome everyone who supports public school education — no money is required! Finally here’s our list of successfully funded projects — our series total is 893! The success-list diary also contains links and additional information about DonorsChoose.org.
