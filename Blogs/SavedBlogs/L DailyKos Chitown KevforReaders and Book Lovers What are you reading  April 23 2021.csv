L, What are you reading?  April 23 2021, Chitown KevforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-04-23, In WAYR? I note what I’m reading and comment...you note what you are reading and comment. Occasionally I may add a section or a link related to books…  I am reading: Rod Serling: His Life Work and Imagination by Nicholas Parisi- So now I’m in the Night Gallery phase of Serling’s career...which means that I’m getting close to the end. Finally. Offhand I have to say that this is a book for true Rod Serling fans (of which I am one). I’ll say more about the reasons why that is the case when I finish...possibly next week more likely two weeks from now. Parisi does a good job explaining the general failures of the Night Gallery series; Serling had little to no creative control over the series as he did with Twilight Zone Jack Laird would routinely edit Serling’s scripts...among other problems with the series The Night Gallery experience did give a certain (now) big time director his first experience in Hollywood though. Spielberg did direct a later episode of Night Gallery which turned out so poorly that Laird and NBC had to bring in another director to finish shooting.  The Jameses: A Family Narrative by R.W.B. Lewis    TIME EST/EDT (LAST SUN OF THE MONTH) 7:30 AM You Can't Read That!    or Paul's Book Reviews
