L, July's Pictures, Aashirs naniforStreet Prophets, 2021-07-03, Welcome to the Street Prophets Coffee Hour cleverly hidden at the intersection of religion and politics. As with many other people I’m still isolating almost to the point of shielding even though I had my Moderna vaccines in February and March. I missed my daughter’s 50th birthday last July and I’ll miss her 51st birthday this year too. We aren’t having the ultra-extreme weather of the PNW. We had serious heat here a couple of weeks ago and now it’s a more reasonable 90ish for the next few days. In between though we did have a lot of rain. So how have I coped? Well I published my first novel last December and I’m well into the next one. I’m still learning another language. And I lost a fair amount of weight. All those things people thought they’d use the lockdown to do I actually did them. And a good thing too since it looks like this will be going on yet a while longer while the Delta and DeltaPlus variants make their way through us here in Kansas. But I also have had plenty of time to get out and take pictures in my woods and pasture. In addition I’ve turned some of the photos into ‘watercolor paintings’ with Photoshop. We find our amusements where we can. So here’s what goes on in July on the farm.                  And how is everyone else coping?
