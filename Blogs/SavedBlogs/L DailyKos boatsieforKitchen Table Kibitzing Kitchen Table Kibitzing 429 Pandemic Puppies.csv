L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 4/29: Pandemic Puppies, boatsieforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-04-29,  The sounds of kids at the school down the block from where I live resonate through the neighborhood midday and after school bringing back a sense of normalcy and a hint of joy into the late April days. Since school’s reopened we’ve had to change our walking routines which brings us off the campus and over to the community field a few blocks away. This morning there were six dogs walking the mile ellipse around the green field and the baseball diamond. It brought to mind how many more dogs there are on the streets since COVID. When I moved onto this street five years ago there were three dogs on the street. Currenntly there are at least ten. People flocked to pet adoption agencies and breeders as the pandemic offered them the opportunity to work from home.  Many found however that they weren’t prepared for the amount of time and training that goes along with bringing a new dog home. Shelter Animals Count which runs a database that tracks shelter and rescue activity looked at pet adoptions during the pandemic. The group which tracks about 500 rescue organizations across the country recorded 26000 more pet adoptions in 2020 than in the year before — a rise of about 15 percent Between March and December the NYT reports nearly 12.6 million households got pets increasing the need for dog trainers.  New pet owners are running into problems with their pets in public because there aren’t enough people outside to propertly socialize pets.  Danene Brown and Darryl Powell thought adding a third dog to their home in Richmond Va. would be easy; the first two were a cinch to train. But when the couple picked up Hopper a French bulldog puppy last February that assumption was almost immediately challenged. “The pandemic made it nearly impossible to socialize him” said Ms. Brown a physical therapist and Hopper developed a “Napoleon complex.” “Any time that we would try to introduce him to another dog on a walk he was aggressive and protective of us and didn’t know how to play well with others” she said. www.nytimes.com/... So are all these people satisfied with their new pets? The American Kennel Club reports:  When the going gets tough the tough get dogs. That was the lesson of 2020 when global lockdowns saw dog breeders’ waitlists multiply and rescues empty as everyone rushed out for a furry companion. But new findings reveal a stunning 73 percent of people who became first-time dog owners during the COVID-19 crisis have considered rehoming their pup once the pandemic ends. Owners cite their surprise at the time and money it takes to care for a dog as well as insufficient access to information about dog care.  A BBC article notes:    Searches for "buy a puppy" in the UK quadrupled in the middle of March last year before doubling again in early May while similar trends were recorded in the US. In many cases irresponsible breeders raised their prices by thousands of pounds as demand for puppies shot up. Then in November search terms related to selling puppies and dogs online - such as "sell puppy" and "selling a dog" - saw spikes on Google. Forbes has a realistic guide Getting A Pandemic Puppy? Here Are 10 Major Costs To Consider which details the expected costs for food licensing spaying or neutering healthcare toys and treats vaccinations and routine vet visits but also warns of the expenses one doesn’t expect like emergency surgery for a foxtail obedience or training courses or dog walkers and boarding.
