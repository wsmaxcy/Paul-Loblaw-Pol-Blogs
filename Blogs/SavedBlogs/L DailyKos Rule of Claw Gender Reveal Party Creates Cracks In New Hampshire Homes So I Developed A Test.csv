L, Gender Reveal Party Creates Cracks In New Hampshire Homes So I Developed A Test, Rule of Claw, 2021-04-23, So.  First off it is not a gender reveal party.  It is a biological sex reveal party and it is a narcissistic trend.  But these people apparently decided to rent a quarry and detonate 80 pounds of tannerite which as it turns out makes for a might strong boom. www.wmur.com/…  Kingston police are investigating an explosion that shook homes in neighboring towns and was apparently part of a gender reveal party. Police said the explosion happened at about 7 p.m. Tuesday on the property of Torromeo Industries on Dorre Road. Residents of Kingston and neighboring towns said they were startled by the blast. "To have something like this occur outside normal business hours and of all of the blasts that we have experienced nothing was as loud as we experienced on Tuesday night" said resident Sarah Taglieri. The sound was captured on a home surveillance system miles away in Plaistow. For some it knocked pictures off the wall. Others told police that cracks formed in their home's foundation. At times like these aside from the obvious social distancing concerns what is it about the appearance of a genital on an ultrasound that makes people jump to any activity requiring the word “detonation?” So in order to screen my friends I have developed the “How Important Are You Test?” If you score too high on this test we are no longer friends. 1.  Do you think the sex of your baby is so important that State Farm needs to put extra adjusters on call? 2.  Have you ever looked at a quarry and thought “That would be a good place to detonate something in honor of my Y Chromosome.” 3.  Does the concept of “memorable moment” in your mind necessarily involve earplugs and hiding under a desk? 4.  Have you ever contacted the Mythbusters to try to contract them as party planners? 5.  Has TLC ever approached you to do a reality show? 6.  Is your last name Kardashian? 7.  Has your party invitation ever included  a map with a location called “Blast safety zone?” 8.  Has one or more of your family members ever died at one of your parties due to a projectile? 9.  Are you banned from Party City? 10.  Would your party cake fail to get through a metal detector?  If you answer yes to even one of these questions nope we can’t be friends.  Good luck Earth. You’re welcome. -ROC Thanks to your help Robert and his pooties and wuzzles are eating and not thrown out of their home.  He is in the process of doing an ultrasound to look at his heart and it is so crucial for him to keep his insurance.   Tito the dog is resting comfortably but after explaining that the dog is probably not a candidate at his age to deal with brain surgery he has decided to focus on palliative care.  Most of all he is trying to navigate life in a town with little to no jobs and no interest in a server in his mid 50’s with severe mobility issues and a potentially failing heart. In the coming days I intend to release a series of diaries about  the deficit in assisting those physically challenged.  Any other questions just ask.  He is always on the brink of homelessness if their home is condemned and he is trying to get the repairs done to prevent that. If you can find it in your heart to help his story and how to help can be found here: gofundme.com/...? To send him immediate assistance www.paypal.com/... I am still giving. In any case thanks for reading and be well. -ROC
