L, Photo Diary: A Walk Along Tampa Bay, Lenny FlankforShutterbugs, 2021-04-29, St Pete FL has some nice parks along the waterfront. Some photos from a walk. For those who don't know I lived in a converted campervan and traveled around the country posting photo diaries of places that I visited. But the pandemic has clipped my wings and I am now holed up in Florida until I can begin traveling again. :)
