L, Meidas Touch video on the Radicalization of the GOP and an appeal to Republicans to reject it., AKALib, 2021-05-01, This powerful new ad by Meidas Touch has a different twist than those that have preceded it. It aims its fire squarely at the Republican party and its enablers in right-wing media. It does not mention trump although his image flashes by in the video. It is targeted at Republican voters. It starts with images of terrorist organizations around the world transitions to terrorism in the America over the years and then focuses on the insurrection of Jan 6 and its instigators. It compares Republicans leaders and right-wing media personalities to terrorist leaders militant preachers and radical clerics. It uses phrases like “the radicalized Republican Party” and “the twisted people on TV who speak for them.” The ad is aimed at Republicans at least the Republicans it can reach and those who will listen. It appeals to Republicans to reject the party resign from it reject what they have become and stop voting for it. It is not an ad against one Republican personality or one candidate it is an ad against the entire party. It appeals to the grown ups among republican voters by implying that some of the young ones are “lonely alienated sad angry and confused.” 📺 NEW VIDEOThe radicalization of the Republican Party is a danger to us all. We must reject it. #ResignRepublican pic.twitter.com/nd0JZaIegG YouTube link. Here is the transcript of the video - The lonely. The alienated. The sad and the angry. In every country torn by strife violence and hardship men and women are drawn to extremist leaders promising to take on the enemies of their people. In America some of our lost souls respond in a similar way to the call of influential voices. But instead of militant preachers or radical clerics every single night in America they can listen to our own angry advocates of division and conspiracy. Confused angry people hear the call of those voices and take on the camouflage of warriors to threaten and even kill civilians. The radicalized Republican Party and the twisted people on TV who speak for them use the very same language of intolerance and rage to provoke those alienated people actively pouring kerosene on the fire of social unrest. And until we all reject these poisonous voices the result will inevitably be escalating violence and tragedy. Resign from the Republican Party. Reject what they have become. Of course the call to “resign” from the GOP also means to stop voting for it and its candidates. There are a few positive responses to the ad from republicans; can’t tell how authentic they are. I spent most of my life identifying as Republican. But after the last 4 years I will NEVER do that again.The party went down a fatal path.Following a fake TV personality. Wtf?!And now they keep doubling-down. I am way too American for this dipshittery.#ResignRepublican https://t.co/AvFgIcZW7r  35 years as a Republican and proud to be a Reagan Republican. I voted for a Democrat in 2020 and glad that I did. The party of president Reagan and Mr Lincoln is dead.#ResignRepublican  This is so good! The Meidas Touch inspired me to #ResignRepublican a year ago when I sent my first ever political contribution to them and then became a member of the Meidas Mighty. Having deep familial Republican roots I actually am in recovery; feeling regrets making amends. https://t.co/XCYSwpKu12 Here is an insightful article from the Washington Post about how the “lonely alienated sad angry and confused” get recruited and radicalized. Why did the deadly serious Capitol attack look like a frat boys’ carnival? “It’s just wonderfully refreshing to be with people who view the world as you do” said a leading white nationalist. https://t.co/3jbNRJIU1q  The far-right groups that blossomed during Donald Trump’s presidency — including white supremacists self-styled militias and purveyors of anti-government conspiracy theories — have created enduring communities by soft-pedaling their political goals and focusing on entertaining potential recruits with the tools of pop culture according to current and former members of the groups and those who study the new extremism. They approach young people on gaming platforms luring them into private rooms with memes that start out as edgy humor and gradually grow overtly racist. They literally sell their ideas commodifying their slogans and actions as live streams T-shirts and coffee mugs. They insinuate themselves into chats offering open ears and warm friendship to people who are talking online about being lonely depressed or chronically ill. The pathways into the kind of extremism that led to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol threats against lawmakers and last year’s armed confrontations at state capitals nationwide are often initially anything but ideological. What the various strands of the far right have in common is the ability to give some Americans a sense of community. One may argue that appealing to Republicans in an ad from a progressive organization is pointless since Republicans are not the ones who will watch this video. But hopefully it will reach out to a few Independents and Republicans who keep an eye on such things and from there spread to friends and families. Let’s do that ourselves and spread this video and its message far and wide. There is no magic bullet to stop the Republican party from sliding into full-scale radical fascism but every little bit that influences public opinion helps. What do you think? P.S. I think they should make a similar ad against vaccine disinformation.
