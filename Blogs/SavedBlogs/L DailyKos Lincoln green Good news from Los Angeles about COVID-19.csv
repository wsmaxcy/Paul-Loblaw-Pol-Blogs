L, Good news from Los Angeles about COVID-19, Lincoln green, 2021-04-23, At the start of the year Los Angeles was the epicenter of COVID-19 in this country. LA County had more than three times as many daily cases as any other US county 20% of COVID-19 tests were coming back positive area hospitals were full and public health systems were bracing for the worst. In February US Senate Republicans even attempted to scuttle President Biden’s nomination of California attorney general Xavier Becerra for Health secretary arguing “The case we’ll make against Becerra is: He will make your life worse. He will make the pandemic worse.” How things have changed. Now Los Angeles has the lowest infection rate of any major US metro area. In “California’s coronavirus case rate now the lowest in the continental U.S.” the LA Times’s Luke Money reports that last week California averaged 2320 cases per day compared to the more than 40000 cases per day it observed during the pandemic’s peak. According to the New York Times California is now seeing 6 cases per day per 100000 people the best rate in the Union and much better than the US average of 19/day/100k to say nothing of Michigan’s 62/day/100k. In “Covid-19 Rates in Los Angeles Have Gone From Worst to Among the Best” the Wall St. Journal’s Talal Ansari and Ian Lovett write that California’s decline in cases is thanks in large part to Los Angeles County which has a quarter of the state’s population. Why has California fared so well? It’s not simply due to vaccination: the state’s vaccination rate is lower than the US average. Possible theories include a virus variant that’s keeping out more infectious strains and immunity due to previous spikes in infection. But nobody really knows. The state is not resting on its laurels. The University of California and California State University systems both plan to require COVID-19 vaccinations this fall for all faculty staff and students who do not have documented medical or religious exemptions — this is more than a million people — assuming the FDA formally approves the vaccines and supplies are available. And LA County is for the first time offering walk-up vaccine appointments. Realistically though the state cannot prevent people from more-infected locations from arriving COVID-19 will be endemic for the foreseeable future in California people still die of COVID-19 every day in Los Angeles and future surges in infection rates are entirely plausible. Still the recent decreases in infection rates are good news and Californians at least for now can breathe a bit easier. Oh and Xavier Becerra? As our Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this week he said “What we want to do is continue to encourage Americans to continue to get vaccinated.” Republicans politicians are still unhappy about him and are presumably hoping that enough of their Republican base stays unvaccinated so that COVID-19 remains endemic so that Becerra and other Democrats get blamed. And as for public health well that’s not something Republican politicians care much about.
