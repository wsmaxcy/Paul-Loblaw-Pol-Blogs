L, (Original) Memorial Day Observance - National Cemeteries and Memorials, FoundingFatherDAR, 2021-05-30, Note — This is a slightly edited repeat of a diary posted last year for New Day Cafe.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all National memorials merely some I’ve visited and/or been near.  Originally known as Decoration Day it originated in the years following the Civil War and became an official federal holiday in 1971. Many Americans observe Memorial Day by visiting cemeteries or memorials holding family gatherings and participating in parades. ✂ On May 5 1868 General John A. Logan leader of an organization for Northern Civil War veterans called for a nationwide day of remembrance later that month. “The 30th of May 1868 is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion and whose bodies now lie in almost every city village and hamlet churchyard in the land” he proclaimed.   www.history.com/...    But it wasn’t until a remarkable discovery in a dusty Harvard University archive the late 1990s that historians learned about a Memorial Day commemoration organized by a group of freed black slaves less than a month after the Confederacy surrendered in 1865.  ✂ “There was a file labeled ‘First Decoration Day’” remembers Blight still amazed at his good fortune. “And inside on a piece of cardboard was a narrative handwritten by an old veteran plus a date referencing an article in The New York Tribune. That narrative told the essence of the story that I ended up telling in my book of this march on the race track in 1865.” If the news reports are accurate the 1865 gathering at the Charleston race track would be the earliest Memorial Day commemoration on record.  www.history.com/...  The origin of Memorial Day trace back to 1865 when freed slaves started a tradition to honor fallen Union soldiers and to celebrate emancipation and commemorate those who died for that cause. pic.twitter.com/CobOJ49Flv  Today in History: First soldier buried at what would become Arlington National Cemetery 1864 @ArlingtonNatl #otd #tih https://t.co/IEhFe7NnDK pic.twitter.com/nFeVZby13C  George Washington Parke Custis grandson of Martha Washington and adopted son of George Washington acquired the land that now is Arlington National Cemetery in 1802 and began construction of Arlington House which was ultimately named after the village of Arlington Gloucestershire England where his family was originally from. The estate passed to Custis's daughter Mary Anna who had married United States Army officer Robert E. Lee. Custis's will gave a "life inheritance" to Mary Lee allowing her to live at and run Arlington Estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it.[4] Upon her death the Arlington estate passed to her eldest son George Washington Custis Lee.    ✂ At the outbreak of the Civil War most military personnel who died in battle near Washington D.C. were buried at the United States Soldiers' Cemetery in Washington D.C. or Alexandria Cemetery in Alexandria Virginia but by late 1863 both were nearly full.[12] On July 16 1862 Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program.[12] In May 1864 Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area.[12] The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves) it had a view of the District of Columbia and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.[13] The first military burial at Arlington for William Henry Christman was made on May 13 1864[14] close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27.[15] However Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15 1864.[16] Arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981 on July 26 1948.[17]   ✂  When I was a young girl my family stopped at Arlington Nat’l Cemetery during a cross country trip.  The only thing I remember of that place was paying our respects at JFK’s grave (less than three years after his death.)   Arlington National Cemetery Goes Virtual to Commemorate Milestone Anniversary https://t.co/2lqgoKmNgL  On May 15 1920 the marble colonnades of the amphitheater were dedicated. ✂ In lieu of public events to mark the amphitheater's centennial the cemetery prepared an online exhibit available on its website.

The Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery spans 77.5 acres and rests on former Army coastal artillery station Fort Rosecrans. It overlooks the San Diego Bay on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other. 📷 IG: muhammed_elarbi pic.twitter.com/9FPpHPXeWv  In the early 1970s my family often vacationed in San Diego for sailing and playing in the ocean.  One place we stayed at a few times was located in the Pt. Loma area which is steeped in WWII history such as streets and landmarks named for Adm. Chester Nimitz.  Several years later my BIL was stationed at the San Diego Naval base.   More veterans & their families are laid to rest at Riverside National than anywhere in the national cemetery system. Arlington has more graves with more than 400k compared to about 250k at Riverside. But Riverside is expected to one day surpass it.🇺🇸 https://t.co/gWzgjMUZXF pic.twitter.com/cUfSI8Z2vE  RNC was established in 1976 through the transfer of 740 acres (300 ha) from March Air Force Base a section that during World War II was called Camp Haan.[2] The site was selected in 1976 to provide full burial options for Southern California veterans and their families by President Ford’s Commission for National Cemeteries and Monuments. An additional 181 acres (73 ha) was transferred by the U.S. Air Force in 2003. With 15 Medal of Honor recipients in attendance and the Marine Corps’ greatest fighter ace Joe Foss as featured speaker RNC was dedicated and opened for burials Veterans Day November 11 1978. RNC's first burial was Army Staff Sgt. Ysmael Villegas who was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery at the cost of his own life at Villa Verde Trail on the island of Luzon in the Philippines March 20 1945. Following the war he was buried at Olivewood Cemetery in Riverside.[3] Prior to the opening of RNC the Veterans Administration asked the Villegas family if he could be honored by re-burial in the new National Cemetery. I was born and raised in Riverside.  That is some interesting history to discover as my family lived somewhat adjacent to Olivewood Cemetery when I was a child. RNC was not dedicated until I was in college and no longer living in Riverside.  The government just put up this statue called “The Gift” at California's Riverside National Cemetery to honor Native American veterans who have served in America's armed forces in greater numbers than any other ethnic group across U.S. history. Very regal aura don't you agree? pic.twitter.com/BFnxD7inOQ  United States Navy Sailor Kirby Stapleton was killed in action in Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941. Kirby was one of 429 crewman who died when Pearl Harbor was attacked but his remains were not identified until last year. Today he was laid to rest at Riverside National Cemetery pic.twitter.com/SppBzsuoIT  5 May 1989: The #USS Arizona which was sunk at the start of World War II at Pearl Harbor is designated as a National Historic Landmark. The #battleship was built in 1914-1915 at a cost of $16 million. #WWII #history #PearlHarbor #ad https://t.co/jy2pF6sUmS pic.twitter.com/3g2FhzMTHh  At some point during his WWII military service in the Army my dad saw duty in the South Pacific.  He did not tell war stories while I was a kid (that I heard) so I don’t know how many battles he participated in if any or if he knew any soldiers killed in action.  One thing I recall him mentioning was having to be careful to not step on sea urchins while wading along the beaches in The Philippines. His father the first generation of their family to be born in U.S. served in the Spanish-American War. There are so many extraordinary women of the WWII era who we have not heard enough about. @Tara_Moss shares how they rejected the entrenched prejudices of gender race disability and religion to achieve incredible feats. #MemorialDayhttps://t.co/7wogrAgI6a  WATCH: Veterans lay wreaths at the WWII Memorial in Washington D.C. Monday as part of a ceremony to honor the more than 400000 Americans who died while serving in World War II https://t.co/Nm0zbabql8 pic.twitter.com/UKyabu8K5m  This Memorial Day we will have a President who supports our men & women in uniform & our Veterans!We also have a President who would never call our Veterans losers! #MemorialDayWeekend pic.twitter.com/jYN7JjJ1Dr   The World War II Memorial honors the service of 16 million members of the Armed Forces of the United States of America the support of countless millions on the home front and the ultimate sacrifice of 405399 Americans. On May 29 2004 a four-day “grand reunion” of veterans on the National Mall culminated in the dedication of this tribute to the legacy of “The Greatest Generation.” Twenty-four bronze bas-relief panels flank the ceremonial entrance. To many these panels stir memories as they tell the story of America's experience in the war. Granite columns representing each U.S. state and territory at the time of World War II ring an impressive pool with water shooting high into the air. Quotes references to theaters campaigns and battles and two massive victory pavilions chronicle the efforts Americans undertook to win the war. A wall of 4048 gold stars reminds all of the supreme sacrifice made by over 400000 Americans to make that victory possible.   Today is #VEDay the anniversary of the end of #WWII in Europe. We are proud to share the National Mall with the WWII Memorial and thank all who served and sacrificed. pic.twitter.com/AMJuG6FzBm  The Vietnam Memorial on the National Mall consists of three separate parts: The Three Soldiers statue the Vietnam Women’s Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall also known as The Wall That Heals. 🙏🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/MHP9E3nOqH  The Memorial Wall is made up of two 246-foot-9-inch (75.21 m) long black granite walls polished to a high finish and etched with the names of the servicemen being honored in 140 panels of horizontal rows with regular typeface and spacing.[2][3] The walls are sunken into the ground with the earth behind them. At the highest tip (the apex where they meet) they are 10.1 feet (3.1 m) high and they taper to a height of 8 inches (200 mm) at their extremities. Symbolically this is described as a "wound that is closed and healing" and exemplifies the Land art movement of the 1960s which produced sculptures that sought to reconnect with the natural environment.[4] The stone for the 144 panels was quarried in Bangalore India.  ✂ The wall originally listed 57939 names when it was dedicated in 1982;[5] however other names have since been added and as of May 2018 there were 58320 names including eight women. The number of names on the wall is different than the official number of U.S. Vietnam War deaths which is 58220 as of May 2018.[6] The names inscribed are not a complete list of those who are eligible for inclusion as some names were omitted at the request of families.  The Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. All of its components including its walls stainless steel statues and Pool of Remembrance are dedicated to members of the U.S. Armed Forces that served and sacrificed during the Korean War. ~ #WashingtonDC #Memorial pic.twitter.com/l43TGKRB09  During its relatively short duration from June 25 1950 to July 27 1953 36574 Americans died in hostile actions in the Korean War theater. Of these 8200 are listed as missing in action or lost or buried at sea. In addition 103284 were wounded during the conflict.  www.koreanwarvetsmemorial.org/...  This is how I plan to celebrate Memorial Day: by remembering those who fell so we could breathe free as equal citizens of a self-governing republic not as the dominated subjects of a truth-denying fact-free fascist state. https://t.co/BzhCbPyST6  More than 645000 poppies representing the sacrifices of men & women of our Armed Forces since WWI situated between the Korean War Memorial & the Vietnam Veterans Memorialon the National Mall. #HonorThroughAction #NationalPoppyDay pic.twitter.com/OixDNVcrbg
