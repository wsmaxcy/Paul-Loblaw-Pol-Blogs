C, LeBron James: The cop who shot Ma'Khia Bryant is "next" , Allahpundit, 2021-04-21, Atrocious.  I blacked out the cop’s face in the screencap. The actual tweet showed it. The most famous athlete in America with 50 million followers on Twitter. And he’s putting a target on this guy’s back because he stopped one girl from stabbing another to death. Black lives matter. Except for the life of the girl whom Bryant nearly murdered I guess. Please listen to what the girl who didn't get stabbed today had to say about the use of lethal force: pic.twitter.com/cjasIXkDgn — William Bishop (@TVGBadger) April 21 2021  I’m willing to give James the benefit of the doubt and assume that he wouldn’t have said what he did if he had watched the bodycam footage first. But that only makes his “next” comment more irresponsible. Social-media mob justice is rancid even in the best circumstances. But what kind of cretin would sic 50 million people on someone without at least first checking to make sure that person was guilty of wrongdoing? Remember this is the same guy who accused Daryl Morey of being “misinformed” when Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong’s democratic protesters. Morey wasn’t misinformed about China though. LeBron was just as he’s misinformed about the Bryant case. Wait until he finds out about how the police in China behave. Hashtag: ACCOUNTABILITY. After an avalanche of criticism for his tweet he deleted it at around 4:45 ET. Whether he realized his error himself or was muscled into disappearing it by panicky NBA press flacks calling him up and telling him to abort I don’t know. We’ll find out. But this is the most prominent example yet of people absolutely losing their g-ddamned minds over the Bryant case. I understand why progressives are eager to remind the country that convicting Derek Chauvin doesn’t in and of itself solve every problem of policing but demagoging this cop for intervening in a fight that could have turned deadly at any moment to try to serve that point is insanity. And insanely dangerous for the cop himself needless to say.
