L, Georgia's Intransigent 63%, Old Verger, 2021-07-07, Down heah in Georgia the current death rate from Covid is 8.4 per day. By the end of June that will be about 260 of us if the death rate doesn’t go up because of the Delta variant. Which it probably will. Even so there are a whole bunch of us who would rather die than get inoculated with a life saving vaccine. As stupid as that is it gets worse. So far as I’m aware Governor Kemp is doing nothing to  promote the health of Georgia’s citizens. And that makes no sense politically because almost all of the unvaccinated appear to be Republicans. So help me understand this please ‘cause I don’t think he’s trying to turn Georgia blue.
