L, Morning Open Thread - With Selections from Bob Marley's Exodus (1977), P CareyforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-04-23,  Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve come to think of this post as one where you come for the music and stay for the conversation—so feel free to drop a note. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. Good morning everyone. I’m afraid I’m stuck this morning trying to manage on my phone—which means I can’t find the format buttons for “left” “right” or “justified.” So I’m stuck on “centered.” Given my technological limitations and feeling (this morning at least) that form should somehow follow function I shall stay brief and centered. Be centered; Stay centered. But never forget That the mysterious and exciting Are almost always Hidden in the shadowy corners and secreted vestibules. ❧     ❧ ☕️ Grab your coffee or tea and join us please. What's on your mind this morning? ​​​​​​​
