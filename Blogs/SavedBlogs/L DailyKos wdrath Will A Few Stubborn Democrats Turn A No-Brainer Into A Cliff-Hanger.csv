L, Will A Few Stubborn Democrats Turn A No-Brainer Into A Cliff-Hanger?, wdrath, 2021-05-04, One of the biggest “no-brainers” in American political history at least in my viewpoint would be to authorize Medicare to be able to use the power of its huge pool of health care clients to negotiate for lower drug prices. And yet….since 2003 when Republicans were in charge Medicare has been specifically prohibited from doing so by federal legislation. Apparently massive mounts of money from Big Pharma is more important to Republicans than anything else including the physical and financial well-being of their own party members struggling under the weight of costly prescription drugs. It will require federal legislation to overturn that ludicrous prohibition. Now that Democrats have control of Congress again one would think that with skyrocketing drug  costs letting Medicare negotiate lower drug prices would be a piece of low-hanging fruit politically speaking. And as villainous as Republicans have been on this issue once again a few rotten apples on the Democratic side of the aisle have the potential to turn a sure-fire win on a matter that has the overwhelming support of the American public into another setback for us progressives. Below is an Associated Press article published by USA Today. It says that while most Democrats are pushing the issue “a small number of Democrats remain uneasy over government price curbs on pharmaceutical companies.”  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/03/democrats-look-path-rein-medicare-drug-prices/4920566001/ Here we go again. Who are these Democrats? And why would they (or anyone for that matter) oppose such a common-sense approach to help address this major problem? The article specifically mentions only one Democrat by name New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez as being uncommitted on the matter.  Even perpetually obstinate and recalcitrant West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is not among the potential villains on this one for a change. In fact kudos to him for being a co-sponsor of legislation supporting this legislation in the Senate. If anyone knows of any other Democratic members of the Senate (and/or House) who are reluctant uncommitted or even opposed on this issue please let us all know in the comments section below. To my way of thinking we need to start putting pressure on Menendez and any other Democrat who is being hesitant to ensure they come around on this issue. We should make this into a “no-brainer” for anyone Democrat or Republican thinking otherwise. https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-welch-introduce-legislation-to-cut-prescription-drug-costs-for-seniors
