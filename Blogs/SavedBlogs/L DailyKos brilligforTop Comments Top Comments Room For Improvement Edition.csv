L, Top Comments: Room For Improvement Edition, brilligforTop Comments, 2021-05-03, I don’t know about your circles of friends but mine generally are good people. Try to do good things leave the world a better place and not be racist sexist homophobic etc. We’re trying to work on our biases and do our part to tear down systemic oppression.  And that’s why what I read on a friend’s social media wall hit me hard. I’m not going to post verbatim what my friend said but it went something like this: OMG I totally pwned a telemarketer! Here’s what happened [and my friend posted a transcript in the classic Me:  Them:  format] Friend: Hello Telemarketer: Is this <friends name>?  where friend’s name is phonetically spelled as if the telemarketer is a non-native English speaker with the implication they’re not in the US. Friend: No you’ve reached <friend’s name> implying that TM asked for a different person because he couldn’t speak the name correctly TM: I’m calling about…  written as ‘Kwaling aboot... etc. The part where my friend thinks he pwned the caller is irrelevant and imho not worth repeating except to note he ended with “Interesting that at the end he actually sounded like he was from America” That’s racist AF in my opinion. And several friends who know this person (a member of my UU congregation) agreed when I messaged them asking if I was overreacting. Trust me when I say the punchline in no way depends on me knowing the ethnicity of the telemarketer. I considered making a reply but my prior experience with this individual when I’ve challenged their word choices as it pertained to gender identity and to ableism is not great when in person so I wasn’t going to do it on social media. It was more emotional energy than I was willing to expend for likely no benefit.   I offer this tonight because it really reminded me that while in comparison to the “life was better when women knew their place when black and brown folks didn’t get uppity and those gays and transgender people didn’t exist” segment of society we on the left are WAY way better… don’t rest on those laurels. Our work isn’t done and there is always more hidden away in our subconscious to unpack and dismantle to move another step closer to dismantling our inherent biases.   Not an hour later I saw a post by another friend — this time a very public well-known author. He too was sharing a telemarketer story featuring a non-native English speaker. Except what he did was instead of mocking the pronunciation said “… a heavily accented voice identified himself as...”. It was factually descriptive without the racist not-so-undertones. Had the friend I first mentioned simply stated that his telemarketer had an accent suggestive of an outsourced call center I wouldn’t be writing this diary tonight.   Hop over the Story Break and join us for tonight’s Top Comments Mojo and Pictures… after a moment of silence for our dear Jotter who earned infinite mojo today.    Here at Top Comments we welcome longtime as well as brand new Daily Kos readers to join us at 10pm Eastern.

Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down.
