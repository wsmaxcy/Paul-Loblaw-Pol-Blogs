L, Family: Latino Man Died in Alameda Calif. Police Custody In "Same Manner They Killed George Floyd", Charles Jay, 2021-04-27,     The family of a Latino man who died in police custody in Alameda California says body camera footage shows officers kneeling on his back and shoulder until he became unresponsive.      Mario Gonzalez 26 died on April 19 after police responded to 911 calls that described a man talking strangely and smashing a bottle on a tree stump in a city park.     The initial police report claimed that Gonzalez died after what was described as a “scuffle” and “physical altercation” as they attempted to restrain him followed by a “medical emergency.”    A day after viewing the body camera footage on Monday family members told a news conference and rally outside the Alameda Police Department that the video contradicted the initial  police account. They said Gonzalez was not violent or fighting officers.     At the news conference Gonzalez’s younger brother Gerardo spoke:     "Yesterday my family and I saw the footage and we know what really happened. Alameda police officers murdered my brother Mario" Gerardo Gonzalez said. “Everything we saw in that video was unnecessary. And it took a minuscule event and made it fatal.”     “My mother was heartbroken to see Mario’s last moment. She gave birth to him her firstborn raised him and now has to bury him. It was painful to watch the violence and disregard for his humanity” he said. “The police killed my brother in the same manner that they killed George Floyd."        Later Tuesday Alameda officials publicly released the original 911 calls and police body camera footage of the events leading to Gonzalez’s death.       A statement announcing the release of the video said: "The City of Alameda is committed to full transparency and accountability in the aftermath of Mr. Gonzalez’s death."      The statement added that separate investigations into Gonzalez’s death are being conducted by the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department and Alameda County District Attorney’s Office and a private law firm hired by the city.      Officers responding to the 911 calls are shown calmly talking to Gonzalez for nearly nine minutes before attempting to get his hands behind his back.       Here is how the Mercury News reported on what happened next:       After about two minutes of officers telling him to stop resisting an officer takes him to the ground with his face landing in what appears to be bark-covered dirt in a home’s front yard.      The officers keep their hold on top of Gonzalez as he struggles and can be heard yelling talking answering officers’ questions crying out and even retching at one point. One officer remains over his legs and another with his arm and knee on Gonzalez’s backside as they attempt to get his arms behind his back to handcuff him. ...       The footage shows that about five minutes pass between the officer taking Gonzalez to the ground and his becoming unresponsive. In the moments before an officer repeats “no weight on his chest” correcting the other officer who is leaning on Gonzalez.      In a matter of seconds officers then begin checking for a pulse before performing CPR.      “He went from combative to nonresponsive almost immediately” a police officer later says as paramedics arrive. Then the footage ends.        Gonzalez was then taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The three officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave.      The Gonzalez family wants the officers to be fired and prosecuted. They are represented by an attorney Julia Sherwin an expert in restraint asphyxiation who served as a consultant to prosecutors in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin the Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing George Floyd.     The Mercury News released an excerpt from the body camera footage showing the last  minutes of Mario Gonzalez’s life. Please note that the contents are quite graphic.        After viewing the video on Monday afternoon Gonzalez’s mother Edith Arenales released a statement:     “The footage shows what we already knew” she said. “Mario was a kind man and level headed. There was a way to deal with this situation without killing my son.”     So tragic so unnecessary.
