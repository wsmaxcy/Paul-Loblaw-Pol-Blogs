L, Amusing obituary, deebee, 2021-04-25, This obituary appeared in the Tampa Bay Times today. Iâ€™m guessing he was a seasonal resident here in Florida. CASSIDY Hugh Joseph "Hughie" 61 of the Bronx New York sadly passed away the evening of April 17 2021 surrounded by family who refused to watch another Law and Order which we believe ultimately is what caused him to leave us when he did. He made the family promise to keep him at home all the way to the end. Although we were able to honor that I am pretty sure he regretted it at the end as he yelled "yous don't know what you're doing." We sure did not but we did hold up our end of the bargain. We may have contributed to his early departure but ultimately colon cancer was the cause. A frequent TV yeller never wanting anyone to touch his recorded shows which included the Real Housewives to only the highest quality cheesecakes for every holiday he said he is glad to make it long enough to vote Trump out of office and to flick off his job one last time before retiring. He enjoyed a good argument and was a prankster at heart. It did not take much to get under his skin and most of us enjoyed pushing his buttons daily. Hugh went from cable tech to house flipper to stock broker all in a short amount of time. We have pledged to only buy the stocks he told us to buy. What an amazing life he had. Hugh was a Navy veteran and survived by his nagging wife of 36 years Kathleen Cassidy; and smart ass children Joanne Dauphin Sean Cassidy and Christina Cassidy. He also leaves behind his father Joseph Cassidy and brothers Joey Cassidy Patrick Cassidy Mike Cassidy and John Cassidy. The family will be having a private wake at McArthurs Irish Pub but in lieu of flowers the family has asked that you make a donation to Suncoast Hospice in Hugh's name. In addition we ask that you crack open a Keystone Light or piss water as we referred to it in his honor. Link
