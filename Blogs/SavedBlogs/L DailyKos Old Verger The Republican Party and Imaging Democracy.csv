L, The Republican Party and Imaging Democracy, Old Verger, 2021-05-10, My father a U. S. Army officer said that communism was good for the Russian people. It wasn’t that dad approved of communism; he didn’t. But communism had introduced the idea of voting to people who  had never voted before. He was convinced that the Russian people couldn’t even imagine what democracy was like. Voting — flawed as  it was — could be a first step toward democracy. Trump is still trying to show Republicans (and the rest of us) how superior our lives would be under his dictatorial and fascist leadership. Unfortunately about three-quarters of the Republican party cannot imagine what living in a dictatorship would be like because they have never experienced that. Couple that with dissatisfaction with messy and contentious democracy and you have the perfect recipe for insurrection and rebellion. We really are in a fight to maintain and even expand our democracy — an effort to form a more perfect union — in a time when it is under a really serious attack from within. Patriots must in this present danger continue to imagine an even better democracy.
