L, Have you ever seen a musical group on tour before they were famous?, CameronProf, 2021-05-11, Picture yourself at your first ever concert.  I was 14 years old. The year was 1983. The place was Pine Knob a music venue in the far NW suburbs of Detroit.  I was in heaven! Why?  Because I was going to get a chance to see the coolest band of the time! “Men at Work”   Opening for them was a band that I had never heard of….INXS or some odd combo of letters.   I did not get into them at the concert (And actually never did like them too much) but little did I know what the future held.  How about you? Did you ever see a band perform before they became famous?
