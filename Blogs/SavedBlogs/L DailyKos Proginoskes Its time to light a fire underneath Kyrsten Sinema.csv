L, It's time to light a fire underneath Kyrsten Sinema, Proginoskes, 2021-07-01, In the movie Mars Attacks! there’s a scene where the Martians wipe out Congress. Jack Nicholson playing the President says “I want the people to know that they still have two out of three branches of the government working for them and that ain’t bad.” Well we’re not doing quite that well in real life. The Supreme Court just announced that any election law that gets passed is find and dandy with them never mind that it might discriminate against certain voters. We have a House that wants to keep this from happening and I’m sure Joe Biden will sign the bill but the Senate aye there’s the rub. It all comes down to the filibuster. With the filibuster there’s no John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. With no act there’s no fair elections any more. Which means Democrats in states like Arizona — who have enacted “acceptable” election laws — might not get elected. Including … her. So I sent her a message. Dear Senator As you are undoubtedly aware today the Supreme Court released a decision on Brnovich vs. DNC which concerns the recent flurry of election bills that the Arizona Legislature has passed (along party lines). This lawsuit was filed to stop not only the bills but their underlying philosophy. The Supreme Court has thus away chipped away another piece of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. States are allowed to run their elections as they see fit; however the Voter's Right Act established some common ground and kept “Jim Crow” laws from being enacted. Currently there is a bill in Congress called the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act which has stalled because the Republicans (who stand to lose from the requirement of fair elections) have been filibustering the proceedings. Your stand in not wanting to remove (or even modify) the filibuster is allowing them to do with with impunity. If the filibuster is not removed then there is no chance that the advancement will pass. This means state Legislatures will be free to pass unconstitutional legislation designed to disenfranchise certain groups (such as the indigenous peoples of Arizona who tremendously helped Joe Biden and Mark Kelly win Arizona). Under these new laws Democrats will be at a marked disadvantage. It is very likely that YOU WILL NOT GET RE-ELECTED. Note that this is a direct cause-and-effect connection; it has nothing to do with public opinion (although I hear that that’s not helping you either). I am not requesting a response because I expect it will be the usual boilerplate. I am severely hoping that not only will you consider the contents of this letter but will also act on it instead.
