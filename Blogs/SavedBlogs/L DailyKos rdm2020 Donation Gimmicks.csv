L, Donation Gimmicks, rdm2020, 2021-06-28, I've gotten many requests for donations in the past several years after I decided to become politically active. Many of these requests suggested a particular amount say $3 and then link the potential donor to a site like Act Blue. But the kicker is the page you're sent to does NOT have a pre filled out choice for the amount you agreed to donate! It's dishonest to request a $3 donation then send me to act blue with no $3 donation amount listed. This is deceptive fund raising that I would expect from the Republicans but I find it distasteful from ANYONE! I've noticed it for a while but now I'm getting fed up. From now on I am going to call it out.Â  The Progressive Caucus asked me for a $3 donation then sent me to an ActBlue page with $15 $25 and larger amounts and a "another amount" button which when clicked assumed I was donating $25! This is unfortunate for me but could be devastating to someone who doesn't notice the change of amount and has little money to spare. Shame on you Democrats!!!
