L, 'The poverty was manufactured by racism.' White supremacy begets economic inequality., ian douglas rushlau, 2021-05-03, Addressing the persisting pervasive destructive effects of economic inequality is not distinct from addressing the persisting pervasive destructive effects of White supremacy.  Structural Racism and American Democracy Historical and Theoretical Perspectives Manning Marable United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (2001) The fundamental problem for the viability of American democracy therefore may be the problem of what can be termed structural racism whether the majority of American people its leaders political organizations and institutions have the capacity and vision to dismantle the complex structural barriers which severely curtail the democratic rights and socioeconomic opportunities of millions of their fellow citizens who are African American Latino American Indian Arab American and Asian and Pacific Island Americans. Does this nation possess the political courage to affirm these truths as self-evident that all citizens regardless of race are born with certain unalienable rights and that first among these is the right to exist as human beings? Can democracy be more than an abstract ideal when tens of millions of its citizens feel alienated and marginalized by what have become the normal and routine consequences of American racialization in daily life?… Racism always manifests itself among its proponents as an all-encompassing worldview away of interpreting and understanding phenomena. Balibar observes that racism is a philosophy of history or better yet a historiosophy by which I mean a philosophy that merges with an interpretation of history but makes history the consequence of a secret hidden and revealed to men about their own nature and birth; a philosophy that reveals the invisible cause of the destiny of societies and peoples. The philosophy justifying racial hierarchy thus not only provide an explanation for the continuation of racial conflicts throughout the world but also a historically-grounded method for thinking about the real differences in physical appearance that separate human beings from each other. In this mental universe some people are simply destined to live in the netherworld of inferiority. Others can claim a ìnaturalî superiority which is validated by the forces of history. The entire logic of racism points toward the inevitability of conflict between racial groups and the ultimate inability to negotiate a long-term agreement with the racialized Other. Because the Other doesn’t share our biological origins values and culture it can never be trusted to fulfill its promises. Coercion is ultimately the only language it understands... Over several centuries as America’s political economy has evolved and matured there have been several important changes in how the racialized Other was socially controlled. American Indians were subjected to a series of genocidal wars that marginalized them to specific reservations a kind of territorial apartheid to the point of near extermination. People of African descent were almost universally defined as chattel slaves that is the physical property of whites. Throughout the colonial and early national periods of Americans most white Americans did not own slaves. In fact on the eve of the Civil War only one in four white Southerners owned slaves. Nevertheless enslavement was what could be termed the defining factor of social control which governed American race relations. Ninety percent of all African Americans were slaves and even free blacks in the northeast and midwest were subjected to severe restrictions regarding their civil rights social and economic opportunities. In the language of the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court in 1857 the Founding Fathers never intended for the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to embrace the Negro race which by common consent had been excluded from civilized governments and the family of nations and doomed to slavery. Black Americans were generally regarded as beings of an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations; and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect. It was from this inherently contradictory position on race that America’s master narrative on democracy was forged.

Just racismhttps://t.co/W5ioomO6ah  Covenants were different from States taking Black taxpayers' money and using it to educate white children. For instance SC didn't have a state university for Black people until the FEDERAL government did itHere's the SC Constitution: pic.twitter.com/cCZqeBMzac  But those race-neutral folks love to cite poverty.They're kinda right though. The poverty was manufactured by racism.It's not always the politicians. For instance white people would rather buy a home in a WORSE white neighborhood than live around Black people. pic.twitter.com/hToaWUi5te  What was I talking about? I can't remember. Anyway what would you call a country with racist laws made by racist lawmakers founded by racist founders who still perpetuate racism in financial institutions politics and even when you're just driving down the street?STILL.  Was Tim Scott Right When He Said 'America Is Not a Racist Country'? An Investigation Michael Harriot/ The Root April 29 2021 It is inarguable that America is a political system founded on the racist principles of slavery the genocide of Indigenous Americans and a Constitution that officially declared that a Black life to be worth 60 percent of a white person’s. But that only means that America was racist. Here are the facts: Now Tim Scott would tell you that these are “unequal outcomes.” He would say that racism is something else then define it so narrowly that evidence of racism requires a burning cross and DNA markers that spell out the n-word. But I invite you to scroll up and look at the definition of racism. Or better yet pull out your own dictionary. How does this not describe “the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social economic and political advantage of another?” This is the textbook definition of a “political or social system...designed to execute” the principles of racism. The only way anyone could deny these disparities were due to racism is if they believed that all the non-white people in history were resistant to hard work were dumber were more violent or more succinctly that “race is the fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities.” It has levels and manifests differently based on who what why when and how. To even begin to give a simple definition of this complex structure is just... wrong. Okay back to listening. As difficult as it has been for many self-described progressives to accept economic inequality is simply one aspect of structural racism in the US not a unique or independent societal condition. It is more accurate in fact to view manufactured economic inequality as one method of maintaining the White supremacist state.  If we see economic inequality clearly comprehensively in its full historical context we see that it is a tool— one tool among many— used to establish and perpetuate White dominance in every domain of our society: WHAT RACISM COSTS US ALL JOSEPH LOSAVIO/ International Monetary Fund Fall 2020  A multiracial nation since its independence the United States has struggled to overcome what many refer to as its “original sin”—slavery—and the de jure and de facto racial discrimination that followed its abolition. Systemic racism continues to burden the United States and Black Americans have borne the brunt of its legacy. Racism in local American police departments is a deep-seated problem. According to analysis by the Washington Post and the Guardian Black Americans are twice as likely as whites to be killed by police while unarmed. Although this is one of the most widely known forms of systemic racism the problem runs much deeper… For example racism is rampant in medicine—in 2016 the US National Academy of Sciences found that 29 percent of white first-year American medical students thought that Black people’s blood coagulates more quickly than white people’s and 21 percent believed that Black people have stronger immune systems. Such misunderstanding often leads to inadequate preventive care and inferior treatment resulting in worse health outcomes for Blacks than whites across the board… Racism has restrained Black economic progress for decades. The benefits of the post–World War II GI Bill which fueled the growth of the American middle class were largely denied to Black people at the insistence of white members of Congress from the South desperate to enforce racial segregation—war heroes or not. “Redlining” a Federal Housing Administration policy that refused to insure mortgages in Black neighborhoods shut Black Americans out of one of the most common avenues for accumulating wealth home ownership. These factors have all played a role in a persistent Black-white wealth gap. According to a 2019 McKinsey report median Black families have 10 times less wealth than median white families. (emphasis added)  Because the benefits of White supremacy (for even the poorest Whites) are so pronounced it is no longer a mystery why the so-called ‘White working class’ has overwhelmingly supported White supremacist candidates and policies. They see it as in their own immediate interests to do so: Why So Many Organizations Stay White Understanding how race is historically and structurally built into the workplace  Victor Ray Assistant professor of sociology and African-American studies University of Iowa/ Harvard Business Review Although the interests of workers and management are often portrayed as inherently antagonistic throughout U.S. history white workers and management sometimes have put this economic antagonism aside in favor of a shared commitment to racial exclusion. For instance the Reconstruction-era National Labor Union according to W.E.B. Du Bois “did not want the Negro in his unions did not believe in him as a man…[and] asked him to organize separately.” Rejecting black workers allowed for some types of paid labor to become a white prerogative and forced nonwhites into the most degraded and dangerous jobs. In this environment management often separated workers by race and expected people of color to labor in menial positions and defer to whites. Jobs were mapped onto stereotypical hierarchies with race as an often-literal qualification such as when the refusal to hire black women as industrial laborers contributed to their concentration as domestic workers. Racial divisions also proved financially useful to management as black workers were paid lower wages for the same work (a problem that remains with us today). Although black workers are now overrepresented among union members incorporation came through hard-fought struggles stretching across the 20th century. From A. Philip Randolph’s Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to the Memphis sanitation strike that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was supporting when he was murdered black labor struggled for inclusion. Even predominantly nonwhite organizations can ultimately be subject to white control. For instance in her brilliant book The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap the legal scholar Mehrsa Baradaran shows how segregation and the very capital that black people had accrued in black banks were ultimately used against them. Under Jim Crow black banks were reliant on customers who were disadvantaged in the labor market relative to white workers especially where segregation ensured that black customers could not patronize white banks. This reliance on relatively poorer customers left black banks less able to invest and accrue profits. Segregation between banks also put black organizations at a disadvantage. According to Baradaran because banks often rely on one another for liquidity during crises white banks’ refusal to lend to black banks set the latter up for failure. Following Jim Crow black banks have remained relatively undercapitalized and thus more likely to fail. White banks are still able to leverage the racially unequal playing field to increase their profits at the expense of their black competitors… There are no easy answers when it comes to creating more diverse and equitable environments. And given how deeply American organizations have been shaped by racial inequality I am not hopeful that the type of structural changes needed to make organizations more equitable will appear on the horizon anytime soon. Colleges and universities are retreating from successful affirmative action policies organizational segregation is persistent and whiteness is a key credential for moving up organizational hierarchies. At a minimum leaders should stop thinking about discrimination and inequality as rare events and understand that racial processes often shape behavior in the absence of ill-intent. Conversations about organizational inequality need to refocus from a narrow concern with feelings and racial animus to the massive inequalities in material and psychological resources that organizations distribute between racial groups. Recent calls for reparations can provide a model as these have forced some organizations to reckon with how their roots in slavery contribute to continued racial inequality. Leaders could also begin to examine how their decisions about location and hiring among other choices exacerbate inequalities. White organizations have attempted to deal with racial inequality while wielding meager tools. Organizations that are serious about changing patterns of racial inequality need to move beyond diversity and inclusion and toward reparations and restitution. (emphasis added) If a job is designated as a ‘Black’ job it will also be defined as less skilled or ‘unskilled’ not requiring an education and/or not a role that leads to advancement. When jobs of any sort become less segregated their earning potential drops for Black workers but not for Whites. None of these attributes of the workplace are inherent necessary or inevitable; they are instead constructed. They are constructed to privilege White workers at every level of the economic hierarchy in every domain of public life. Racism is so fundamental to our economic system it’s barely possible to identify any form of economic activity in the US that doesn’t serve to reinforce the political dominance of White supremacy: …wealth in this country is unequally distributed by race—and particularly between white and black1 households.2 African American families have a fraction of the wealth of white families leaving them more economically insecure and with far fewer opportunities for economic mobility. As this report documents even after considering positive factors such as increased education levels African Americans have less wealth than whites. Less wealth translates into fewer opportunities for upward mobility and is compounded by lower income levels and fewer chances to build wealth or pass accumulated wealth down to future generations. Several key factors exacerbate this vicious cycle of wealth inequality. Black households for example have far less access to tax-advantaged forms of savings due in part to a long history of employment discrimination and other discriminatory practices. A well-documented history of mortgage market discrimination means that blacks are significantly less likely to be homeowners than whites3 which means they have less access to the savings and tax benefits that come with owning a home. Persistent labor market discrimination and segregation also force blacks into fewer and less advantageous employment opportunities than their white counterparts.4 Thus African Americans have less access to stable jobs good wages and retirement benefits at work5— all key drivers by which American families gain access to savings. Moreover under the current tax code families with higher incomes receive increased tax incentives associated with both housing and retirement savings.6 Because African Americans tend to have lower incomes they inevitably receive fewer tax benefits—even if they are homeowners or have retirement savings accounts. The bottom line is that persistent housing and labor market discrimination and segregation worsen the damaging cycle of wealth inequality… The black-white wealth gap is a result of the institutionalized obstacles blacks face in building wealth. Take assets for instance: The U.S. tax code prioritizes savings in certain assets over other savings. Retirement savings accounts such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) as well as mortgage borrowing to finance a primary residence receive preferential treatment under the tax code. Yet blacks are less likely to work in jobs that carry benefits such as retirement savings due to historical occupational segregation.25 Similarly blacks are much less likely to become homeowners due to systematic housing and mortgage discrimination.26 These obstacles translate into fewer tax advantages and fewer chances to benefit from recent stock and housing market gains resulting in significantly less wealth for black than for white Americans. Racial differences also exist with respect to debt. Typically blacks have more costly—or high-interest—debt such as auto loans student debt and credit card debt than whites.27 Blacks also pay more for installment loans such as car loans than whites.28 These patterns of having more costly debt in part reflect credit steering—when people of color are steered toward particularly costly forms of credit— and credit market discrimination—when people of color are more likely to be denied loan applications for less costly loans as is often the case with mortgage loans.29 The black-white wealth gap reflects differences both in assets and in debt. And while higher education and increased income offer some benefits they are insufficient to close the wealth gap. Recognizing how structural racism operates in every sphere of public life in America is necessary to undertake and serious effort to dismantle it: No I Won’t Stop Saying “White Supremacy” ROBIN DIANGELO/ Yes! June 30 2017 I am white. When I give talks on what it means to be white in a society deeply separate and unequal by race I explain that white people who are born and raised in the U.S. grow up in a white supremacist culture. I include myself in this claim as I enumerate all of the ways in which I was socialized to be complicit in racism. I am not talking about hate groups of which I am obviously not a member. And no I don’t hate white people. I am addressing most of the audience to whom I am speaking white progressives like me. If it surprises and unsettles my audience that I use this term to refer to us and not them even after I have explained how I am using it then they have not been listening. That recognition should trigger some sense of urgency that continuing education is needed. Yet invariably a white person raises the objection: I really don’t like that term! I associate it with the KKK and other white nationalist groups. Why can’t you use a different term? As a classic example of white fragility rather than stretching into a new framework I am asked by a white participant to use language that is more comfortable and maintains their current worldview. (emphasis added)  In his 1898 The Study of Negro Problems Du Bois argued that sociologists of his time were reproducing rather than contesting racism and ideas of Black inferiority (https://t.co/j4ztzfmeVm). this led him to a systematic critique of sociology   Central to Wells' work was that lynching and racial violence was not just the outcome of individual-level hostility but was an integral part of the social structure. e.g. many Black people who were killed were targeted because they had successful businesses Previous diaries about structural racism White supremacy and economic inequality: Does the economic tail wag the culture dog? An old progressive canard. (Dec. 19 2020) The problem with the ‘it’s all about economic inequality’ mythology (aside from the fact it is mythology) is that serves to reify the bigotry that is at the core of our social political and economic institutions and systems: How Economic Assumptions Uphold Racist Systems Racism shapes how economics is taught and practiced. When we fail to scrutinize neoclassical assumptions they perpetuate racist outcomes. Joelle Gamble /Dissent June 9 2020 Racism is a system that manifests in norms institutions and policies. When economic analyses fail to account for these institutions they perpetuate racist outcomes. Therefore we must interrogate the assumptions often made in economic research and pedagogy that prevent economics from promoting anti-racist public agendas. Unquestioning acceptance of the ahistorical mythology leaves the framework of discrimination intact: Persistent labor organizing brought about union power in manufacturing work. Meanwhile our system of outdated labor standards reflects underinvestment in industries with large concentrations of people of color. The evidence is clear: the presence of strong labor institutions and public investment in standards enforcement makes a difference in outcomes for workers. Why isn’t this investment happening in occupations with high numbers of Black workers and other marginalized communities of color? Stratification economics—which centers race in economic analysis and our understanding of inequality—argues that social group identity plays a major role in how institutions are wielded to shape economic outcomes. The intentional stratification of racial groups—in order to protect white advantages and gains—create intergenerational disparities in wealth and therefore in economic and political power. This in turn shapes both individual behavior and the design of our public institutions. In fact the wealth gap between Black and white families is as wide now as it was in 1968. And extreme wealth which is overwhelmingly white has increasingly more control over political agendas as inequality increases. Stated plainly economic disparities are the result of bigoted policies and institutions which are maintained in the service of a bigoted worldview.  In this book is the argument that Black US-Americans are central to the making of the United States and to the world order and yet they were (and are) pushed to the ontological peripheries of Western humanism and modernity.  This ethos is summarised by Richard Wright when he commented after WW2 that "there isn't any Negro problem; there is only a white problem”   White privilege and white entitlement give rise to white supremacy-- Whiteness as Property. (Sept. 7 2016) The various normative expressions of racism— white privilege white entitlement and white supremacy— must be viewed as both preconditions and products of the political and economic institutions of a nation that was literally founded on purely racist principles. Prof. Cheryl Harris writing in the Harvard Law Review provides a comprehensive and horrifying history of  the legal definition of whiteness and how that definition served as the basis for reifying the racial political and economic hierarchy from earliest days of the US: Because the "presumption of freedom [arose] from color [white]"and the "black color of the race [raised] the presumption of slavery" whiteness became a shield from slavery a highly volatile and unstable form of property. In the form adopted in the United States slavery made human beings market-alienable and in so doing subjected human life and personhood - that which is most valuable - to the ultimate devaluation. Because whites could not be enslaved or held as slaves the racial line between white and Black was extremely critical; it became a line of protection and demarcation from the potential threat of commodification and it determined the allocation of the benefits and burdens of this form of property. White identity and whiteness were sources of privilege and protection; their absence meant being the object of property… (pp. 1720-21) ...the settlement and seizure of Native American land supported white privilege through a system of property rights in land in which the "race" of the Native Americans rendered their first possession rights invisible and justified conquest.This racist formulation embedded the fact of white privilege into the very definition of property marking another stage in the evolution of the property interest in whiteness. Possession - the act necessary to lay the basis for rights in property - was defined to include only the cultural practices of whites. This definition laid the foundation for the idea that whiteness - that which whites alone possess - is valuable and is property. Although the Indians were the first occupants and possessors of the land of the New World their racial and cultural otherness allowed this fact to be reinterpreted and ultimately erased as a basis for asserting rights in land. Because the land had been left in its natural state untilled and unmarked by human hands it was "waste" (pg. 1721). The direct manifestation of the law's legitimation of whiteness as reputation is revealed in the well-established doctrine that to call a white person "Black" is to defame her. Although many of the cases were decided in an era when the social and legal stratification of whites and Blacks was more absolute as late as 1957 the principle was reaffirmed notwithstanding significant changes in the legal and political status of Blacks. As one court noted "there is still to be considered the social distinction existing between the races" and the allegation was likely to cause injury.  A Black person however could not sue for defamation if she was called "white." Because the law expressed and reinforced the social hierarchy as it existed it was presumed that no harm could flow from such a reversal. (pp. 1735-36 emphasis added) Harris’ piercing analysis makes it plain why it is misguided to conceptualize economic justice as somehow distinct from social justice or to argue we can and should ‘move past identity politics’ (for more on this see also my diary ‘Think economic issues matter? Want to fix income inequality? Then fight discrimination.’) : Whiteness is not simply and solely a legally recognized property interest. It is simultaneously an aspect of self-identity and of personhood and its relation to the law of property is complex. Whiteness has functioned as self-identity in the domain of the intrinsic personaland psychological; as reputation in the interstices between internal and external identity; and as property in the extrinsic public and legal realms. According whiteness actual legal status converted an aspect of identity into an external object of property moving whiteness from privileged identity to a vested interest. The law's construction of whiteness defined and affirmed critical aspects of identity (who is white); of privilege (what benefits accrue to that status); and of property(what legal entitlements arise from that status). Whiteness at various times signifies and is deployed as identity status and property sometimes singularly sometimes in tandem. (pg. 1725) If we are to address the abuses and inequities of our political and economic systems we must recognize them clearly and understand them fully for what they are and what they have always been: instruments for establishing and maintaining white supremacy.  "We have an economy premised on Black and brown workers literally putting their lives at risk in order to keep food on the table and pay the rent. And that was true even before there was a pandemic.” — @KSabeelRahman on Momentum: A Race Forward podcast https://t.co/U0mi79zevH
