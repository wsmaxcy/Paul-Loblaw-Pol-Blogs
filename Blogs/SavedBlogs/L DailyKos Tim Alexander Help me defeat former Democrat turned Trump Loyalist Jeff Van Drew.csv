L, Help me defeat former Democrat turned Trump Loyalist Jeff Van Drew, Tim Alexander, 2021-06-30, Hey Daily Kos Community  It’s Tim Alexander once again. I’m a former law enforcement officer civil rights attorney and survivor of police brutality and gun violence – and I’m running for Congress against former Democrat turned Trump acolyte Jeff Van Drew.  Like all of us here on Daily Kos I have been disgusted by Rep. Van Drew’s record in Congress since he pledged his “undying” loyalty to Trump. Beyond the fact that Van Drew has consistently voted against legislation that would help South Jersey like the American Rescue Plan and President Biden’s infrastructure bill he has also turned his back on our democracy:   As a former assistant district attorney I can’t let this contempt for the rule of law slide. But I also can’t flip this district and help keep the House alone. Fortunately the only public poll in the race showed us tied at 47% apiece. We can win this. Here’s how:   I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support. If you can give $27 $50 or more it would truly mean the world.  Feel free to reach out at any time at info@timalexanderforcongress.com. Once again I sincerely appreciate your help!  —Tim
