L, From the GNR Newsroom: Monday Good News Roundup, JessiestafforGood News, 2021-07-05, Hey all Welcome back to the Monday Good News Roundup. Where me and the GNR news team (Made up of Bhu and Killer300). I hope everyone had a good fourth of July I had to work but it was pretty quiet and also I have the week to myself because my dad is on vacation and spending it with friends. So that’s good I actually enjoy the solitude introvert that I am. But although I’m an introvert doesn’t mean I’m going to be reserved when bringing you these stories so lets get to it.  But Lake like many Democrats is optimistic that the GOP focus on stoking their base through endless cultural conflict (on everything from undocumented immigration to critical race theory) will leave Republicans very limited opportunity for gains among the younger generations. “Young people are very turned off by the racism by the climate deniers” she says. “So everything they are doing to solidify their base and everything they are doing to try to win 2022 is digging them into a deeper hole for 2024 with young voters.” Basically the GOP is shrinking but becoming more loyal and the Dems are getting bigger as the GOP keeps sticking to the old culture war song which is good news for us.  On June 25 the workers at General Mills celebrated a remarkable victory. The company had stubbornly refused to countenance their claims offering them an average pay rise of just 1.5 percent offset by cuts to their conditions and new clauses that could see them having to take on more weekend work. After three weeks on strike the global food giant backed down offering a wage rise of 9 percent over three years without any trade off in conditions. The workers also won a $1500 bonus and protection for all labor hire casuals and contractors who participated in the strike. When we organize we win wherever whenever.  Electric vehicles are close to the “tipping point” of rapid mass adoption thanks to the plummeting cost of batteries experts say. Global sales rose 43% in 2020 but even faster growth is anticipated when continuing falls in battery prices bring the price of electric cars dipping below that of equivalent petrol and diesel models even without subsidies. The latest analyses forecast that to happen some time between 2023 and 2025.  The tipping point has already been passed in Norway where tax breaks mean electric cars are cheaper. The market share of battery-powered cars soared to 54% in 2020 in the Nordic country compared with less than 5% in most European nations. Pretty soon electric cars will be everywhere and the world will be a greener place for it.  “We made Slime Rancher working 40 hrs a week” said Popovich at the time. “It has been played by over 5 million people created an amazing company of talented people and currently has a 98% positive score on Steam. There is always another way.” “There is always another way.” Such a suggestion is a relatively recent phenomenon in an industry that’s happily and religiously exploited workers hiding behind terms like “passion” as it grinds through another generation of 20-somethings who inevitably leave games behind. The awful labor conditions in video games are both inhuman and a talent drain. Most of you probably don’t know this (Unless you like me watch Jim Sterling) but the video game industry is pretty trash; its exploitative abusive largely un unionized and companies work game makers to the bone with inhuman crunch times. So when a game gets good press for letting its workers work responsible hours that is something worth celebrating.  Stonewall birthed a robust and diverse movement that kept on going. Following Stonewall we saw an explosion of organizing and organization building. Following Stonewall we saw people come out and come together to shatter the silence break open the closet and lift our voices in defiant demand and persistent persuasive conversation—the chief engine of change. Following Stonewall we saw sustained litigation lobbying electoral engagement fundraising and community building—what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called the methodologies of change—and following Stonewall all that work has never stopped. In that sense Stonewall was the turning point—rightly if imprecisely now considered (and yes celebrated) as the dawn of what we now call the modern LGBTQ movement a model of success. Thanks to activism our movement has made enormous progress and wrought an epic transformation since Stonewall not just in political achievement—such as attaining the freedom to marry; passing nondiscrimination laws; and winning Supreme Court cases such as last year’s victory for employment protections—but in changing hearts and minds and increasing inclusion and acceptance. Lets take a moment to remember everyone who has fought so hard in order to help get us where we are now. The fight is never ending but we will make the world better step by step.  And before we go Youtube lawyer Legal Eagle weighs in on Giuliani’s current legal woes.   Yeah Rudy has some problems but we all knew that. That does it for this weeks GNR have a productive and hopeful week all I know I will.
