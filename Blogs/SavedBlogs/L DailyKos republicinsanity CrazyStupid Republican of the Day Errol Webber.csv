L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Errol Webber, republicinsanity, 2021-07-04, Welcome to what is the 999th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Errol Webber a rare African-American immigrant Republican (from Jamaica) who was a 2020 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in California’s 37th Congressional District hoping to knock off much-beloved Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass.In June of 2020 Webber posted twice in two days on Twitter first baselessly accusing Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (who was not his opponent) of committing “immigration fraud” without any proof or explanation of what he was talking about. He then went on to complain about CNN hosting Sesame Street characters in interviews to help children understand the dangers of Covid-19 saying they were “brainwashing our kids ”.Well of course with Rep. Karen Bass being well-liked and all and her district being pretty liberal she won re-election easily and Errol Webber only got 14% of the vote. Much like his political idol Donald Trump he refused to concede after getting obliterated at the polls claiming that “Every LEGAL vote needs to be counted!”Anyway he was very briefly a candidate for Governor of California in 2022 before withdrawing and is still active on social media trolling sane people by posting things like how Donald Trump deserves credit for Juneteenth becoming a holiday because he hosted a tone-deaf rally in Tulsa on the holiday or conspiracy theories about Joe Biden being debilitated from dementia or that the entire Covid-19 pandemic is a “fraud”.Webber has the look of being on of those “perennial candidates” that people should back away from slowly. Or full on run away from.       One Year Ago July 4th 2020: Donald Bolduc (NH) Two Years Ago July 4th 2019: Keith Rothfus (PA)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago July 4th 2018: Keith Rothfus (PA)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago July 4th 2017: Keith Rothfus (PA)… 2017 UpdateFive Year Ago July 4th 2016: Keith Rothfus (PA)… Original ProfileSix Years Ago July 4th 2015: Richard K.
