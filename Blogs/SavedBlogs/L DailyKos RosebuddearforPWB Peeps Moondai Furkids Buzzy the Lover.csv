L, Moondai Furkids: Buzzy the Lover, RosebuddearforPWB Peeps, 2021-05-10, Did you ever have a kitty that just soaked up love like a sponge? Who wants to cuddle All The Time? Whoever said cats are naturally aloof never met Buzzy. He was my a rescue of my sister’s originally I inherited him when she passed away. Her husband didn’t want him because he just couldn’t take it.  It’s not like her husband doesn’t like cats. He still has Peanut her other kitty. But Peanut is kind of antisocial and properly aloof just like Hubby. They get along. Buzzy on the other hand wants……………..and wants……………..and wants………………...to sit in your lap 24/7 constant headrubs love love love. All the time. If you like them super-affectionate this is the boy for you. My Dad loves it. He has often said he would take Buzzy himself if he didn’t already have Herbie his dog. He was brought to the Humane Society as an unclaimed stray. I am told that they said at the Humane Society that she told them that he walked up to her in the street flopped down and put his head on her foot and looked up at her with big tragic eyes. He has really expressive eyes.  They adore him at the vet. As my Dad says he is quite the accomplished suckup. 😍 He works his magic on everybody who meets him.  It is a good thing Marvin is not particularly the jealous type. Marvin of course has his own little ways of making his needs for attention known. If Marvin was a different type of kitty he might get upset at this usurper constantly hogging Mom’s attention. Fortunately Marvin is quite easygoing about that sort of thing.  Happy Monday All!         PWB Peeps is a group that posts a daily diary and nightly open thread for animal lovers.
