L, An indictment is nigh, Indicted Donald, 2021-06-28, It sure feels like an indictment is nigh. HuffPost reported yesterday that the Trump Organization has until the end of day today to convince New York prosecutors against filing the first Trump World indictment adding to the NY Times story that dropped last Friday.   But will it happen? Is it truly indictment week?  Prediction markets benefit from the wisdom of crowds. Though our data is very early it shows an 88% prediction rate that The Trump Organization will be indicted.* Is this just wishcasting? A heavily biased small data pool?   I’m not a betting person but I predict an indictment is nigh.  *data shown above derived from our forecasting tool.
