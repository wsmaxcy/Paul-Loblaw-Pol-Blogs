L, American Genocide, cckos, 2021-04-26, Interesting that President Biden recognizes the Armenian genocide but no one mentions the American genocide.  Of course this event happened  from 1492 onward — talk about poor immigration policies!  It leaves behind a string of worthless treaties and broken promises. As an example the Black Hills of South Dakota were Sacred to the Sioux Indians and had been ceded to them by treaty with the US Government.  That treaty went by the wayside when an expedition led by Lt. Col. Custer (yesTHAT Custer) reported finding Gold (conflicting reports exist on whether he was ordered NOT to prospect) thus setting off a gold rush stampede.  Then there are the forced resettlements e.g. Trail of Tears so that white settlers could usurp more land.  Continued westward expansion led to more Indian wars.  After the Civil War the Buffalo Soldiers (African-Americans) were introduced out west to help control the region.  An often repeated phrase from that era was ‘The only good Indian is a dead Indian’   As commendable as slavery reparations may be there are existing obligations that must be addressed.
