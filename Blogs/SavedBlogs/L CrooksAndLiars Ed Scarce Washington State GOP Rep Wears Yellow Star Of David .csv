This sickening trend among Republicans is repugnant of course but they keep doing it seemingly oblivious to how offensive this is. I don't get it. Source: Seattle Times A Washington state lawmaker critical of COVID-19 vaccine mandates wore a yellow Star of David at a speech over the weekend ‚Äî a symbol the Nazis forced Jews to wear during the Holocaust. State Rep. Jim Walsh R-Aberdeen had the star affixed to his pink shirt during a speech to conservative activists at a Lacey church basketball gym on Saturday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an echo from history‚Äù Walsh wrote on a Facebook page where a video of the event was posted. ‚ÄúIn the current context we‚Äôre all Jews.‚Äù "We're all Jews." The misappropriation of the infamous star symbol ‚Äî used to identify Jews first for exclusion and then for extermination ‚Äî was criticized as deeply offensive by a local Holocaust education leader. ‚ÄúOur government is making an effort to protect their own citizens not kill them‚Äù said Dee Simon Baral Family executive director of the Seattle-based Holocaust Center for Humanity which works to teach people about Nazi Germany‚Äôs murder of 6 million Jews during World War II. ‚ÄúIt not only trivializes it it distorts history.‚Äù Wow....Republican WA State Rep. Jim Walsh wore a Star of David in protest of vaccine proof saying that "we're all Jews."Wrong. My grandmother had to wear the Star during the Holocaust.
