L, The deafening silence of Fox News on Tucker Carlson's call to harass parents who mask up their kids, Darrell Lucus, 2021-04-27, By now you know that Tuesday night Tucker Carlson engaged in what may very well be the lowest moment in Fox News’ sordid 25-year history. He suggested that if his viewers see parents with kids wearing masks they ought to call the local child protective services agency. Mark Sumner covered it here and News Corpse covered it here. In the last 24 hours Carlson has been kicked up down sideways and several directions in-between. And yet in the absence of something I haven’t heard or seen this has been the response from the fair and balanced network. This America is not acceptable. Period end of discussion. It cannot be stated enough. One of the flagship hosts on one of the largest news channels in this country saw fit to call for his audience to engage in behavior that by any reasonable standard amounts to harassment. And his bosses have more or less gone silent. Which means—again in the absence of something I haven’t heard or seen—they are condoning it.  MSNBC pushed out Alec Baldwin and Martin Bashir for far far less than what Carlson did last night. Baldwin directed a homophobic slur at reporters while Bashir made outrageously vulgar remarks about Sarah Palin. But on what planet is calling for the harassment of private people less egregious than what Baldwin and Bashir did? Back in 2013 Fox bought my hometown’s then-CW affiliate WJZY and made it a Fox O&O (it has since been sold off to Nexstar Media). I briefly mulled applying there believing I’d built up my resume from blogging to get back into my major. After all I’d be helping build a news department from the ground up. But the more I thought about it I decided I couldn’t even consider applying there due to the prospect that I’d have to sell out my ethics. What happened last night is a reminder of why I made that difficult decision. Does Fox News have any consideration whatsoever for the actual journalists on its payroll (yes there probably still are some left after Shep Smith bolted to CNBC)? Surely they wouldn’t want to be associated with a network that effectively condones harassment.  Fox News recently adopted a new slogan “Standing up for what’s right.” Every minute of silence from Fox News is more proof that slogan is empty.  Carlson himself is effectively giving his critics the middle finger by keeping his whole monologue at the top of his Facebook page. Well if that’s Carlson’s attitude the only thing we need to hear from him is an apology—while he’s resigning. And if he doesn’t have the decency to resign Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace need to grow a set and fire him.
