L, Pro-Democracy Newspaper Shut Down in Hong Kong, MokuraiforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-06-28, How do you know when the Hong Kong government is lying? They are talking up human rights. Apple Daily an independent daily newspaper in Hong Kong since 1995 is no more since being declared a security threat under a draconian new law. Staff have been arrested and the publisher’s assets frozen. The newspaper ceased to operate after the Hong Kong police's national security unit arrested company executives on 17 June 2021 for allegedly violating the national security law... [According to media reports the final law would criminalise secession of Hong Kong subversion against the Chinese government terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.[105][106][107] The law is broader than China's own criminal law.[108]] and froze the assets of the company and Jimmy Lai.[5][6] As a result of the asset freeze Apple Daily was unable to pay wages and electricity bills[7] and had to cease operations. The final print edition published on 24 June.[8] The newspaper's main and supplementary YouTube channel "Fruit Seed" also stopped service at midnight on the same day. China claims the power to prosecute citizens of other countries residing outside of China under this law. Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy newspaper closes as Beijing tightens its grip One year was all it took for a Beijing-imposed National Security Law to take down Hong Kong's largest and loudest pro-democracy newspaper. Next Media announced Wednesday that Apple Daily its flagship tabloid would publish its final copy Thursday due to an untenable environment in which its journalists had been arrested and millions of dollars in assets had been frozen. Its digital platform will cease operations on the same day the company said in a statement. The news sent a deep chill through Hong Kong's media industry and undermined government claims the new legislation would not diminish press freedom. Last year China's ruling Communist Party moved to bring Hong Kong in line with its authoritarian rule by bypassing the city's legislature to implement the security law. It punishes anything the authorities deem to be subversion secession terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. While city leader Carrie Lam said back then that press freedoms would still be protected Apple Daily staffers say they knew it was only a matter of time before they were targeted. Yup.  "A woman sent me a note a few days ago saying without Apple Daily she just doesn't feel as safe as she used to with a free press as the protector of society" said Mark Simon one of Lai's top advisers.  "They're coming for everyone else soon." Yup. That too. 1. Most of you may not understand how dreadful the closure of Apple Daily means to Hong Kong. Not only to its journalistic landscape but also to the people and the city itself. This is their last day. They are going to print 1 million copies tomorrow to comm[emo]rate the fight.  1.

Yes it was pro-democracy but it was also pro-Trump on the strength of some of his lies about confronting China. As ever in such political stories if you aren’t confused you aren’t paying attention.
