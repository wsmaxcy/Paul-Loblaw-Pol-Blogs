C, Rush In Memoriam, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-18, I was pre-recording last night’s Dan Proft Show yesterday morning when we got word of Rush Limbaugh’s death. We were almost finished but I used the last short segment to pay a spontaneous tribute to Rush’s career and influence. I didn’t say anything that many others haven’t said as well or better but I thought I would post it for any readers who may be interested in hearing it: Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
