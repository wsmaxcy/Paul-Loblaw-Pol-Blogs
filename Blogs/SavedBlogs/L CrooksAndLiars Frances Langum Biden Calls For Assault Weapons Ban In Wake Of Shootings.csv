L, Biden Calls For Assault Weapons Ban In Wake Of Shootings, Frances Langum, 03-23-21, After the second mass killing via gun in a week President Biden insisted that Congress take action on gun violence and called for a ban on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. "I got that done when I was a senator. It passed. It was a law for the longest time and it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again" said the President. "We can close loopholes in our background check system close the Charleston loophole. That's one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence." Biden also praised the Boulder police officer who lost his life in yesterday's shooting:  "He thought he would be coming home to his family and seven children but when the moment came Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty making the ultimate sacrifice to save lives that’s the definition of an American hero." Biden noted that the issue of gun violence is not a partisan issue.  Polls bear this out. There is so much bipartisan agreement on guns: 82% of Republicans & 93% of Democrats *support stronger background checks*. Yes there are partisan gaps but a *majority from both parties* support banning assault weapons & high-capacity mags. pic.twitter.com/5etnioPTXO — Samara Klar (@SamaraKlar) March 23 2021 The City of Boulder banned assault weapons in the wake of the Parkland shooting in 2018.  A judge lifted that ban based on a gun rights lawsuit TEN DAYS AGO.  An AR15 was used in yesterday's mass murder.  Unbelievable. Boulder banned assault rifles in 2018. A judge lifted the ban just 10 days before this shooting. True a local city-based ban is relatively ineffective and hard to enforce. The shooting may have happened anyway. But the symbolism is stark.  https://t.co/bAugVeACeg — Rahul Siddharthan (@rsidd120) March 23 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
