When I sat down to do this I had….nuthin’.  So I went to read the news only to find out that Fritz Mondale had passed at the age of 93.  Can’t have that as the lede for the morning can we?  Nope!  So.  Have a cuppa while I rummage for something better…. More?? Perhaps some noms?  So...I found something that made me laugh and decided to share it with you lot.  Captions are mine...source is Livestly. It wasn’t just me….I had HELP!! One does love a challenge…. Don’t look at me...I just came in to have that bath you threatened promised! Laundry?  Why yes I do like laundry day!! When George doesn’t want to go walkies...he reallly has a way of making his wishes known!!
