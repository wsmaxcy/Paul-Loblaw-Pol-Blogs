L, Military Brass Rip Tucker For Denigrating Women Soldiers, NewsHound Ellen, 03-12-21, On March 9 Carlson sneered at President Biden’s comments made on International Women’s Day when he spoke about updating combat uniforms body armor hairstyle requirements and maternity flight suits for women soldiers: Sen. Tammy Duckworth a combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient who lost both legs fighting in Iraq slammed Carlson. A lot of senior brass have done the same. Marine Corps Master Gunnery Sgt. Scott Stalker the senior enlisted leader of U.S. Space Command according to The Hill twice reminded everyone that Carlson’s opinion is based on “zero days of service in the armed forces.” Stalker added that his own opinion is based on “28 years of actual service in the military 28 years in the Marine Corps in combat operations out at sea and in garrison” he said.  “The bottom line is that we value women in our in our armed forces" Stalker said. “God bless the men and women that are serving today” and “let's remember that those opinions were made by an individual who has never served a day in his life. Let’s remember that’s all about drama TV.” Stalker was joined by other men in uniform publicly blasting Carlson and speaking out in defense of women in the military: Asked about Carlson’s comments Thursday Pentagon press secretary John Kirby relayed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s “revulsion” at the segment. “What we absolutely won't do is take personnel advice from a talk show host or the Chinese military and maybe those folks feel like they have something to prove that’s on them” Kirby told reporters. Women lead our most lethal units with character. They will dominate ANY future battlefield we’re called to fight on. @TuckerCarlson’s words are divisive don’t reflect our values. We have THE MOST professional educated agile and strongest NCO Corps in the world. https://t.co/WeqWk6IWDq — SMA Michael Grinston (@16thSMA) March 11 2021 Contrary to what you may be hearing this 🇺🇸WOMAN & 1000's of 🇺🇸WOMEN like her are NOT "making a mockery of our military".
