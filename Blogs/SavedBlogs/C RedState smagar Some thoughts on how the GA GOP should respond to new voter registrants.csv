C, Some thoughts on how the GA GOP should respond to "new" voter registrants, smagar, 2020-11-15, We’ve all seen the stories about Democrats urging people to move to Georgia so they can vote in the January Senate runoffs.  I thought it might be useful to start a diary to solicit suggestions on how the Georgia GOP should respond to any wave of “new” Georgia residents and voter registrants in November and December.  Comment and info welcome. I had two thoughts: We all know that it’s important to donate and volunteer.  (The Loeffler campaign lets you volunteer to make calls.  I anticipate the GOP will set up something like “Trump Talk” so that out-of-staters can make calls for Perdue and Loeffler).  What are your thoughts on these suggestions?  Do you have any others? smagar
