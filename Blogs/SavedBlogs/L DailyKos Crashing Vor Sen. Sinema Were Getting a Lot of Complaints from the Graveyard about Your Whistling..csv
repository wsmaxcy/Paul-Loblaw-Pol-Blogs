L, Sen. Sinema We're Getting a Lot of Complaints from the Graveyard about Your Whistling., Crashing Vor, 2021-05-30, Arizona’s senior senator Kristen Sinema along with fellow champion of upper chamber comity Joe Manchin of West Virginia issued a statement on Tuesday calling the creation of a bipartisan commission to examine the January 6th Insurrection critical  to preventing such attacks in the future. Three days later when the Senate was voting on that “critical” issue Sen. Sinema was not in the chamber. Neither she nor her staff have offered an explanation for her absence. However… The senator or someone on her staff has been tweeting non-sequiturs since Friday pre-written timed tweets completely unrelated to Friday’s vote. Constituents heading to Twitter to get answers about their senator’s no-show on such an important vote are being greeted by the equivalent of an answering machine spouting boilerplate bromides. Today and every day we’re standing with the @AmericanLegion and honoring those who sacrificed so much in service to our country. #NationalPoppyDay  We introduced the Grand Canyon Protection Act to strengthen Arizona's economy safeguard access to clean drinking water and protect this national treasure for future generations. pic.twitter.com/WfqOWymmCj  There’s also a retweeted request from a local United Way chapter for aid to fire victims. TwitterWorld particularly those inhabitants represented by Sen. Sinema was having none of it. wtf is wrong with you?? not even an answer as to where you were today??  Listen I’ve tried to have your back because I think a lot of attacks on you have been stupid.  But people’s patience is wearing thin on voting rights and police reform and you had to know tweeting today would be a hot mess for you. The replies go on and on. “No Vote No Pay.” “Where were you?” “OMFG WOMAN!!!!!!” There are Sure Jan memes milk carton memes curtsy memes The Office and Judge Judy memes along with deeply unflattering photos of the senator. Some gentler souls expressed sympathy for the staffers stuck wading through the ratioing while Sinema’s off doing whatever she’s off doing. My favorite was the guy hundreds of replies in who simply said “Read the room.” While it is doubtful that this shower of shaming will have any effect on the senator’s future performance it is encouraging to hear so many Arizonans committing to finding a better Democrat for their senator.
