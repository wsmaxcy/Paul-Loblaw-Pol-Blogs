L, The Birthday Girl, michelewln, 2021-07-06, Today is Pixie’s birthday. She is 17 years old. She is as feisty and mischievous as ever. She is in great health. Pixie was my Mom’s cat until Mom passed away and then Pixie decided I was her mommy. She is such a little scamp. She is very loving towards me. Reid on the other hand she gives a left hook and a right jab. So happy birthday momma’s girl. And here is to many more.
