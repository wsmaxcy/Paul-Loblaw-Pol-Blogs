C, A Republic If You Can Fix It: Elections Election Vulnerabilities and Election Fraud -- A Prologue, tonysc, 2020-11-13, Background Over the two weeks during the 2020 election cycle I volunteered for both early voting and election day in-person voting duty at one of the Clark County Nevada’s voting locations; Clark County includes all of Las Vegas.  I volunteered to work as a check-in operator (the person that verified your eligibility to vote) not to write an account of my time.  I wanted to help with the election and to get some experience with the election side of the equation this series is an idea that naturally flowed from that experience and the things I saw. This series of reports (I plan to write six or more) is based on my processing approximately 1200+ voters during my nine days and 100 hours of work.  For perspective there were 670000 in-person ballots cast state-wide but it I suspect that the following reports are reasonably representative of Clark County Nevada’s election system and processes. To be clear I did not decide to infiltrate the election process to write the report and a ‘got you’ document but rather to help the Clark County Nevada’s election department during a difficult election cycle. The idea for this series of diaries slowly emerged in my head when I saw and read a lot of information about what went on during the 2020 election process much of it uninformed and purely speculative. Most of the original observations are neither positive or negative but in the nature of findings just ‘this is what I saw or experienced’ with as little subjective slant to it. The Initial Plan I had started writing one report but as the discussions in the writing around my experience grew I found that what I wanted to say was (a) already too long to publish in one diary (well over 5000 words) and (b) would likely grow even longer as I wrote. Consequently I came up with the current plan that is to break the report up into multiple diaries and to try something… different. Rather than write something and get some comments and then move on to another diary I wanted to design a process that would use the diary as the seed to develop the main topic I address in each diary.  Consequently the published diary is really just the first draft of a document that will include the feedback from the comments section. The Revised Plan – A Planned Series of Diaries: Each diary will address a separate area in the election process around the voting process but depending on the size two areas may be combined roughly as follows but not necessarily in the current order: Within Each Diary the Following Sections or Discussions Will be Undertaken The plan for these diaries includes breaking each topic down into: (a) Observations (i.e. pure ‘This is what was seen’ or ‘These are credible statements of what occurred’ statements) (b) Findings (i.e. something around “If it was either acceptable or unacceptable that this was happening the way it was observed?”) and (c) Recommendations (or… “If it was not right what should be done to correct the situation(s)?”) Findings at least in my experience flow from not only what was seen but from some overall framework of how things should be working.  Accountability and traceability always a problem where fraud is a possibility impose their own requirements on the process.  These requirements are oftentimes independent of what people think the process should do or what they think they have the time or resources to do. In an audit report oftentimes recommendations are the trickiest of things.  Third-party audits and auditors have no true power over what is done with the reports if anything is done and more than one of my audit reports found the document being quickly put away in a file.  Whereas internal auditors while having somewhat more power to influence the decision makers are oftentimes audit organizations over which they have no direct control over and hence the recommendations are just that ‘recommendations’ but not mandates. The Current Plan Finally the plan for this series of diaries is to provide the readers with something to focus on while reading each section and then after they have been put in the right state of mind to use the collective experience of the readers to help collect additional input (i.e. comments) like new verifiable observations to add to the ‘report’ (a) and then when appropriate to update the resultant (b) Findings and (c) Recommendations. The entire series of diaries will be published within three to five days of each other so it won’t be a drawn out affair. Unlike other comments sections the sections for this series of diaries will be curated for input to the main document and comments and suggestions that can be used to enhance the value of the diary.  The author or someone they designate have sole discretion to include the new material found in comments into the next cycle of diaries. Curating Comments to Discover Gems After each diary’s comments have reached a particular level of curing if necessary the diary will be revised and the comments will be incorporated into a revised diary.  The process will be repeated until it appears to have included all relevant feedback.  Recognizing that some commenters might read one article and think of a comment in another diary any merging of the comments into the main article will take place after all diaries have been posted. After all the planned diaries in the series have been completed a final integrated report will be produced and published in a RedState diary.  Hopefully this work can be used as part of the basis for all future electoral and voter fraud prevention discussions at RedState. Next Steps To be honest I do not know if my plan is flawed and whether this process will work. There is a good chance that only the first one or two planned diaries will be completed under this plan but… I guess we will see. So much for the preliminaries.  The above plan is liable to change as experience demands. Within a day I will publish the first few diaries. Hopefully a few of you will return and contribute to the discussion. A note to readers:  I originally planned on posting the follow-on segments of this diary starting in mid-November time frame for a number of reasons that I am not at liberty to disclose right now I will not resume this series until the December 8th time frame.
