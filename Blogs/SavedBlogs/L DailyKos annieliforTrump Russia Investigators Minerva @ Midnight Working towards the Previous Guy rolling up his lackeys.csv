L, Minerva @ Midnight: "Working towards the Previous Guy" rolling up his lackeys, annieliforTrump Russia Investigators, 2021-05-02, Fear and loathing rises in the land of previous guy. The raid on Giuliani’s apartment and office netted the Feds 10 devices laptops and phones. According to the Trump adviser the (Giuliani) raid ignited a sense of fear inside the former President's orbit that Justice Department officials may be more willing to pursue investigations of the 45th president or his inner circle than many Trump allies had previously believed. Two other people close to the former President who echoed these sentiments declined to be quoted for this story.  Takeaways from the FBI’s Giuliani Raids - His Ukraine machinations are finally getting serious scrutiny after Trump’s DOJ reportedly stalled the investigation. https://t.co/ZW4SSRflV4 Giuliani is reportedly under investigation for potential crimes under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) which makes it illegal to act as an “agent of a foreign principal” without registering with DOJ. As the DOJ explains on its website the purpose of FARA is “to identify foreign influence in the United States and address threats to national security” by promoting “transparency” and “ensuring that the United States government and the public know the source of certain information from foreign agents intended to influence American public opinion policy and laws.” According to the New York Times at least one of the Giuliani search warrants explicitly cited FARA. The Giuliani search warrants appear to comport with the facts leading up to count one of Trump’s first impeachment which charged Trump with abuse of power in corruptly soliciting election assistance from Ukraine to discredit Joe Biden his primary rival for the presidency. [...] One of the warrants reportedly specified that the FBI sought communications between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials including former president Petro Poroshenko and two former Ukrainian prosecutors who are implicated in helping Giuliani collect information about the Bidens. Documents made public in November 2019 further indicate that Giuliani was simultaneously negotiating with Ukraine’s former top prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko for hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees to “Giuliani Partners” purportedly to assist Lutsenko in the recovery of Ukrainian assets. And it’s been reported that Giuliani also sought assistance in his Biden probe from Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian oligarch who is under indictment in the United States and whom Toensing (Wednesday’s other warrant recipient) represents. thebulwark.com/... The infamous call in which former president Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do him a “favor” and investigate Hunter Biden and the origins of the Russia probe took place on July 25 2019 and eventually led to the former president’s first impeachment. But the pressure campaign against the Ukrainians started just three days earlier when Rudy Giuliani then the president’s personal lawyer was on a call with a top Zelensky aide asking him to tell the Ukrainian leader to “just let these investigations go forward.” The call between Giuliani and Andriy Yermak then Zelensky’s top foreign policy advisor and currently his chief of staff happened on July 22 2019. Details of the Giuliani–Yermak call were first reported by Time in February. But today BuzzFeed News is publishing the transcript for the first time.  www.buzzfeednews.com/...  Michael Cohen says “Do I think Rudy will flip on him? Look Rudy has looked like he has lost his mind several times. I don't think he has gone that far that he is going to stay loyal to somebody who is going to throw him under the bus.” With all the information obtained Cohen predicts this will go far beyond Ukraine. “This could be about a multitude of other issues that Shady Rudy has been involved with.” www.msnbc.com/...  Correct. And don’t forget Devin Nunes and his sidekick Derek Harvey were involved too. https://t.co/cQLux4uspJ Strength through DeJoy: corruption of the US postal service was revealed this week when “Chief Postal Inspector revealed to lawmakers on Wednesday that as part of its Internet Covert Operations Program (iCOP) DeJoy personally ordered the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to begin to monitor Americans' social media accounts.” A Senate committee has advanced three Biden nominees for the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors getting us one step closer to a Dem-appointed majority on the board & with it the power to fire Trump's lackey Postmaster General Louis DeJoy https://t.co/EyNjSauCiC Rudy's son Andrew Giuliani: "Any American whether you are red or blue should be extremely disturbed by what happened here today by the continued politititation [sic] of the Justice Department." pic.twitter.com/W2llUUFNZG "Everyone who has the opportunity to observe it knows that the Fuhrer  Previous Guy can hardly dictate from above everything which he intends to realize sooner or later.
