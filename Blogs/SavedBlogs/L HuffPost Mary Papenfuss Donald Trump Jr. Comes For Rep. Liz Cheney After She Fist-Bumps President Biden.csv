L, Donald Trump Jr. Comes For Rep. Liz Cheney After She Fist-Bumps President Biden, Mary Papenfuss, 2021-04-29, The idea of hands across the political aisle had Donald Trump Jr. sputtering Thursday after he spotted Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) fist-bumping Joe Biden before the president’s address to Congress on Wednesday night. Donald Trump’s eldest son fumed about the gesture before Biden delivered what Trump Jr. called a “radical socialist vision” for America (like increased taxes for the wealthy). He erroneously claimed the fist bump occurred after Biden’s remarks when in fact it occurred as the president walked to the podium so perhaps Trump Jr. didn’t actually watch the speech he attacked. He also griped in a tweet that Cheney and the rest of the “GOP leadership” (i.e. his dad’s punching bag Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell) has apparently become so “inclusive” that Democrats might be welcome.  Biden fistbumped Liz Cheney No. 3 House Republican on his way to the podium: pic.twitter.com/ibCM0FlOS6 CNN’s Chris Cillizza warned that the brief fist bump could launch a thousand negative ads against Cheney though she quickly bashed the policies outlined by Biden as “bad for Wyoming and bad for America.” Cheney was one of at least 20 people whom Biden fist-bumped or elbow-bumped on his way to the podium. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) last November fist-bumped then Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). But it was apparently too much for Trump Jr. to wrap his head around the concept of politicians disagreeing and still being civil — even friendly — with one another. “Republican” warmonger Liz Cheney gives Sleepy Joe a fist bump after he delivered a radical socialist vision for the future of America. So glad she’s in the GOP leadership I guess they wanted to be more inclusive and put Democrats in there too?!? pic.twitter.com/T1qke3TO5b Cheney herself schooled Junior — and other critics — on civility hours after his tweet. While she disagrees with Biden’s policies she explained “we’re not sworn enemies.” When the president “reaches out to greet me in the chamber of the House of Representatives I will always respond in a civil respectful and dignified way” she tweeted.  I disagree strongly w/@JoeBiden policies but when the President reaches out to greet me in the chamber of the US House of Representatives I will always respond in a civil respectful & dignified way. We’re different political parties. We’re not sworn enemies. We’re Americans. Other on Twitter were eager to pile on the former president’s son. She comes from a time and place when the GOP wasn’t entirely made up of reactionary asshats. It was way back before you cared about politics. Are you trying to cancel Liz Chaney because she has an alternative point of view than your own?Hypocrite. Seems someone doesn't have the attention span to actually have watched the speech. Nor were you raised with any manners. This was BEFORE the speech. It's called being polite. Not being a hate-filled insurrectionist agitator. Lindsey Graham did this with Kamala Harris a couple of months ago. Are you going to say the same about him or is he okay because he licks your fathers boots? No she actually has respect for the President of the United States. Well at least ones that don’t try to undermine American democracy. And from the vault...’cause there’s always something... pic.twitter.com/OayEboqVLR Don junior hates Liz Cheney for one reason she told the truth about his treasonous daddy. pic.twitter.com/MmSrHPkUg7 I wish Biden was socialist. Here's a January 6th picture of a radical vision for the country. pic.twitter.com/cU7PwXrxtc
