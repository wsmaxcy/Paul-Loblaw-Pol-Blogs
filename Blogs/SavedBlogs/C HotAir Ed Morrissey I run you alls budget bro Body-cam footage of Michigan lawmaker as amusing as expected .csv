C, "I run you all's budget bro": Body-cam footage of Michigan lawmaker as amusing as expected , Ed Morrissey, 2021-04-26, Meet Jewell Jones one of the youngest and newest members of the Michigan legislature. The Democrat is also the latest public figure to find out how well the “do you know who I am” strategy plays with police especially when at twice the legal limit for a DUI. Jewell got arrested and charged with several felonies after a a few fellow motorists called 911 warning Jones would likely kill someone before he drove his car into a ditch. All of that came out well over a week ago but the body-cam and dashboard footage emerged only yesterday. No word yet however on how Jones’ call to Gretchen Whitmer might have gone: BREAKING: Dash cam released of Democrat Rep Jewell Jones resisting arrest threatening to call Gov Whitmer. He had just driven drunk into a ditch pic.twitter.com/8jndId62sp — Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) April 25 2021  The video shows police tackle a combative Jones to the ground after he physically resisted arrest and threatened to call Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Jones can be heard reminding the officers that he had oversight of their budget as they attempt to put handcuffs on him. “I don’t give a f— bro when I call Gretchen [Whitemer] I’ll (sic) need y’all (sic) ID’s badge numbers everything” Jones says in the footage. “It’s not going to be good for you I’m telling you. I run y’alls budget bro” he told a trooper. When an officer asked Jones to present his driver’s license the 26-year-old responded “I can’t do that.” Police initially arrested Jones 26 on April 6 after his black Chevy Tahoe bearing an “ELECTED” vanity plate drifted erratically across multiple lanes before he pulled off onto the shoulder and rolled into a ditch according to reports. Classy. Ten days ago the Detroit Free Press painted what now looks like a pretty accurate picture of Jones and his arrest which includes the fact that he had a loaded and unsecured pistol in the car: State Rep. Jewell Jones was so confrontational after driving his vehicle into a ditch on I-96 while allegedly drunk that state troopers used a Taser and pepper spray on him a prosecutor said Friday. Livingston County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Carolyn Henry said Jones D-Inkster drove so recklessly between Southfield and Fowlerville on April 6 that numerous other motorists called 911 to report his driving. After Jones drove the vehicle into a ditch his unidentified passenger required medical attention and Jones became confrontational with emergency medical technicians and police producing badges instead of the photo identification police requested and attempting to show “his status of importance as he put it” said Henry who did not specify what types of badges Jones allegedly displayed. Jones had a semi-automatic .40-caliber Glock handgun in the cup holder of the vehicle she said. Jones had a blood alcohol content of at least 0.17% according to the complaint. That is more than twice the 0.08% limit at which a person can be convicted of drunken driving. That’s not Jones’ biggest legal problem however. He faces four counts of felony resisting charges that could put him in prison for two years. The body-cam and dashboard footage shows pretty clearly that the police officers gave Jones opportunities to cooperate but he refused. Instead he tried bluffing his way out by showing the officers his legislative ID and threatening them with retaliation if they arrested him — even though his accident had injured his passenger. Jones has been pretty quiet about this since his arrest releasing a statement that he is relying on his faith to recover from a crazy week. From the way this footage looks Jones might want to spend some of his time rethinking his custom license plates as he’s likely to see his career come to an end one way or another in the near future. Perhaps Gretchen can fill him in on that when he gives her a call.
