C, Where is the best high school basketball played?, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-03, Ask any basketball fanatic in the Washington D.C. area and he will say the best basketball is played in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC). Of course if you ask the same question of fans in a dozen or so other cities they will identify their top league as the nation’s best. Last season (2019-2020) though the WCAC’s claim had more behind it than just local chauvinism.  Consider the way its top seniors are performing now as college freshmen. Let’s start with DeMatha the city champions. Its two biggest stars were Hunter Dickinson and Earl Timberlake.  Dickinson is now one of the top centers in all of college basketball. Playing for Michigan the number 2 ranked team in the country he is averaging 14.4 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. The other night he outdueled player of the year candidate Luka Garza of Iowa who also played high school ball in D.C. but not in the WCAC. (However last night he was outplayed by Illinois’ Kofi Cockburn another of college basketball’s top centers.) Timberlake went to Miami in the ACC. Before sustaining an injury he was averaging 9 points 5 rebounds and 2.5 assists as a freshman. Paul VI was the runner-up to DeMatha in 2019-20. That team featured Jeremy Roach as its point guard. Roach went to Duke where he is playing starter minutes. Deployed mostly on the wing he’s averaging just under 9 points per game.  Gonzaga College High School a 15 minute walk from the Capitol has three seniors from 2019-20 playing major college ball this year. Chuck Harris a wing guard starts for Butler in the Big East. He’s the team’s leading scorer at 12 points per game. He hits on 39 percent of his three pointers. Gonzaga’s star player wasn’t Harris it was Terrance Williams. After decommitting from Georgetown Williams joined Dickinson at Michigan. He comes off the bench for that uber-talented team. Myles Stute of Gonzaga is the WCAC’s contribution to the SEC. He’s at Vanderbilt. Stute plays about 15 minutes a game averaging 4.3 points and 2.4 rebounds. He’s making just under 50 percent of his field goal attempts. St. John’s College High School rounds out the WCAC’s big four. Last season its star was Ishmael Leggett. He now plays for Rhode Island in the A-10.  Leggett averages 6.5 points in 19 minutes and makes 44 percent of his three-point attempts. His overall shooting percentage — 48 percent — is the highest of any non-center on the team. Having watched a few Rhode Island games my view is that Leggett a high energy player should be getting more minutes. Mikey Square the center for St. John’s in 2019-2020 plays 20 minutes per game for Farleigh Dickinson. He averages 6 points and 3.7 rebounds. As good as the WCAC was in 2019-2020 it might have been better the year before when the players discussed above were juniors (but Roach missed the season due to injury). Here is a rundown of the top seniors who graced the league that season. DeMatha had Justin Moore and Jahmir Young. Moore averages 13 points per game for Villanova ranked number 10 in the AP college basketball poll. Young the fourth scoring option for DeMatha averages 18.4 points per game at Charlotte. St. Johns was led by Casey Morsell who I believe was WCAC player of the year. At the University of Virginia a top-25 program Morsell hasn’t scored much. However his stellar defense has kept him in Tony Bennett’s rotation to the tune of about 20 minutes per game the past two seasons.  Hard-driving Anwar Gill was the unsung hero of Gonzaga’s WCAC championship team of 2018-19. Gill played prep school ball last season. Now he averages 6 points in 20 minutes per game as a freshman for La Salle.  Josh Oduro was Paul VI’s big man in 2018-19. He was overshadowed by that team’s guards including Trevor Keels a sophomore back then and now a McDonald’s all-American. A sophomore at George Mason Oduro averages 10.4 points and 6 rebounds. Recently he scored 27 in an upset win over then-first place VCU.  Darius Maddox was a junior for St. Johns in 2018-19. A smooth jump shooter with range he played his senior year at Oak Hill Academy as a starter for a team ranked in the top 10 nationally. Maddox is now at Virginia Tech. As I said D.C. is far from the only city that can claim to have the best high school basketball. Baltimore just up the highway features hard-nosed hoops and produces many quality college players. In a typical year its basketball might well be as good as Washington’s.  However one would be hard pressed to identify any city whose high school ball was superior to D.C.’s from 2018-2020.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
