C, Who Is the Phoniest of Them All?, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-03, There is no shortage of phonies on the Left but I have always suspected that Pete Buttigieg may be a contender for the top prize. Buttigieg planned a photo op of himself riding up to the White House on a bicycle to demonstrate his “green” bona fides as Secretary of Transportation. So how did he do it? He took a Chevy Suburban along with his handlers to a nearby location and then took a bike out of the back of the vehicle. A Chevy Suburban–how green can you get?  There is nothing like a guy wearing a suit and a helmet on a bicycle to inspire confidence. For his next photo op maybe Buttigieg can take a tank for a spin. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
