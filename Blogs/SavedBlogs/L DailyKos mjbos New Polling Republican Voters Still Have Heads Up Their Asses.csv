L, New Polling: Republican Voters Still Have Heads Up Their Asses, mjbos, 2021-06-30, Media: 56% of Republicans think Biden election was based on fraudulent election! (OMG inferred!!). Dear Media: Full poll results: 36% of all voters polled believe same which means 64% BELIEVE JOE BIDEN WAS ELECTED IN FAIR ELECTION. Also means 34% of Republican voters DO NOT believe the bullshit which is SIGNIFICANT. Even if fat-ass were to foolishly decide to run HE WOULD NOT BE ELECTED. His loss would be even larger than 2020. His ego would never allow him to put him in that position. Sincerely Rational Americans of all political persuasions.  The scam will continue even through the ‘24 election as is is a money maker for fat-ass even if he isn’t running.  Beyond time to push back on media polling results and point out the obvious. Fact is fat-ass is not going to put himself in a position to lose again. Take it to the bank.
