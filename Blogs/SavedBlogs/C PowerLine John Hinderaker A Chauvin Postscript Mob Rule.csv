C, A Chauvin Postscript: Mob Rule, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-21, Last night Alan Dershowitz and I were on the Ingraham Angle on Fox News talking about the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. In an 8 1/2 minute segment we covered quite a bit of ground and it seemed to be well received. So if you are interested here it is:  I also gave an interview to the Daily Signal yesterday while the jury was out. The interviewer Virginia Allen was good and I think the conversation was interesting. The points I made were similar to what I wrote here but probably elaborated on at more length. You can either listen to the interview or read the transcript here. Sebastian Gorka saw the transcript and liked it and I was a guest on his radio show today. You can listen to that conversation here. It is part of today’s first hour. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
