L, Writers scam alert, Karina Holosko , 2021-05-11, There is a Writers Scam circulating the internet. I have been contacted twice. First it was from a woman named Jane Smith then another woman named Jane Wentworth. Apparently Jane suffers from Apraxia which means that I cannot speak to her directly. There is a phone number that does not work but she suggests you text. Jane needs a writer. And she is ready to pay. $1.00 a word for 2550 words. That's right $2550.00 total. Yep you heard it here first. That includes the little words like "a" "it" "to." OMG I just made three dollars. Red flag. As a general rule when you are unsure of an email look at the bottom to see how the email was sent. Jane sent hers by Zoho mail. That is an untraceable email server. Proton mail falls under that category as well.  If you want to send someone a news tip and don't want to be traced you can open an account to protect your identity. Well Jane has a sponsor and a budget. Red flag. The word "sponsor" is an old-fashioned business term.  This language means that the person is most likely overseas and learned Queen's English. Just aside when you do deal with online scams watch out for the language. For example they will often use the word "dear" and other words that just don't seem to fit like "sponsor." Jane wanted me to write about how computers negatively affected people and even supplied me with the outline. By this time however I knew it was a scam. Who in their right mind would pay a dollar for the word "it?" Naturally curious I decided to go down the rabbit hole so I sent Jane a sample back and she was thrilled. Next she wanted my mailing address my full name and phone number. (This is information that they will use to threaten you later.) So I said "no no Jane I only use PayPal. To which Jane replied. Well my sponsor is old-fashioned and he only uses a bank check. A certified bank check. What could go wrong? Big bright red flag. That's where I stopped the nonsense. The people who run these rings are rough trade so I didn't want to poke the bear. The word PayPal should be enough to send them away. But here's the question that you've been burning to ask. "How do they scam you Kay." Here goes. If you get to the point when they have your address they will send you a check. But that will be a check over the amount. Say for $3000.00. They will admit the mistake have you deposit the certified check into your bank account and send them the $1000.00. By the time that happens their check has bounced and you're in for the money.  Below please find an example of the emails sent to me. ________________________________________________________________________ My name is Jane Wentworth an academic consultant.
