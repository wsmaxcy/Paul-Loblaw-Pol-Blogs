L, Kevin McCarthy Ripped For Absolutely Orwellian Line In His Liz Cheney Letter, Ed Mazza, 2021-05-10, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced Monday that he was leading an effort to boot Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from her GOP leadership post.  Cheney is on the outs because she has refused to endorse former President Donald Trump’s “big lie” about the 2020 election being “stolen” and has blamed him for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that was carried out by his supporters.  That makes one line in McCarthy’s letter to his Republican conference stand out:  “We are a big tent party. We represent Americans of all backgrounds and continue to grow our movement by the day. And unlike the left we embrace free thought and debate.” Given that the letter is announcing his decision to hold a vote that is likely to eject a member from party leadership for her “free thought and debate” many on social media found the statement more than a little ironic if not positively Orwellian: Nothing says you "embrace free thought and debate" like expelling the people who disagree with you https://t.co/k7hiCWFTyZ “And unlike the left we embrace free thought and debate.”George Orwell! thou shouldst be living at this hour... pic.twitter.com/JrUI7EGqj4 "Unlike the left we embrace free thought and debate" McCarthy says in a letter explaining why the party has to purge a member of the leadership team for too much free thought and debate. https://t.co/F30ndfVxoa Kevin McCarthy in writing to his colleagues and urging them to remove Liz Cheney as conference chair claims that Republicans "are a big tent party" and that "unlike the left we embrace free thought and debate." He is not being ironic. This @GOPLeader letter is out-of-touch unhinged and Orwellian. What a complete failure of a leader and a human being. pic.twitter.com/Adfmo6Xkc5 McCarthy on recalling @Liz_Cheney for criticizing Trump: "we need to make a change."Same letter: "we embrace free thought and debate" https://t.co/Cm9J2Wdztf "We embrace free thought and debate but we kick out anyone who doesn't say exactly what we want."I thought cancel culture was bad. I think most Americans have read George Orwell & are no longer fooled by McCarthy’s war is peace slavery is freedom doublespeak. 😢 https://t.co/2hCUK8RiNA House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy says of the GOP days before he pushes out Liz Cheney for daring to criticize Trump: “We are a big tent party — and unlike the left we embrace free thought and debate.” This is Orwellian doublespeak isn't it? https://t.co/8TabWdDMf9 Orwellian https://t.co/Wq8Q5SgoYA We embrace free thought and debate but we need to cut a member of our leadership team for free thought and debate. https://t.co/XeaZhG3ns4 pic.twitter.com/702Iv0rz9n “Unlike the left we embrace free thought and debate*”*unless you admit the election was legit call Biden ‘Mr. President” or say anything negative about Velveeta Voldemort then we remove you from leadership positionsFixed your letter you sniveling sycophant @GOPLeader https://t.co/gQdVJGQMp7 Kevin "Free Thought" McCarthy is literally cancelling Liz Cheney for having free thought. https://t.co/UO3uGFYo7Z Kevin McCarthy.....While ousting Liz Cheney "Unlike the left we embrace free thought & debate.” pic.twitter.com/AZDXLQIOXc Wow that’s just brazen - they really have doubled down on the lies which is hardly surprising for a party without a platform. The GOP is a cult whose only article of faith is the Gospel of Trump.  Liz Cheney is being cancelled for heresy and the thought crime of truth. They embrace free thought and debate? Sort of like they embrace the truth? pic.twitter.com/nn7Bl2TWoM
