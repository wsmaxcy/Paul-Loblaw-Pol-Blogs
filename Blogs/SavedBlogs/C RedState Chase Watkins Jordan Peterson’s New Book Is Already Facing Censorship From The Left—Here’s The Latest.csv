C, Jordan Peterson’s New Book Is Already Facing Censorship From The Left—Here’s The Latest, Chase Watkins, 2020-11-25, Before it’s even been published the new book has Penguin Random House employees literally crying calling transphobia and filing complaints.  Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules For Life is one of the best-selling books of the 21st Century. It’s no wonder either. With rules like “stand up straight with your shoulders back” and “do not bother children when they are skateboarding” the psychologist-by-trade offers tough-love father-like advice to help readers put their life together. Peterson harshly condemns nihilism defends the right to free speech and explains the why behind important values like the necessity of telling the truth. It’s Peterson’s focus on helping aimless young men and refusal to be governmentally compelled to use speech with which he doesn’t agree that has the Left up in arms though. A now-delated video from the far-left outlet Mic even made fun of Peterson for crying in anguish at the rising rates of male suicide.  Luckily despite the Left’s attempts at taking him down Peterson’s message of bettering yourself taking on responsibility and facing the world with confidence and faith continued to spread. Given the huge success of 12 Rules For Life the psychologist-by-trade announced a sequel after the self-help book had sold over two million copies. In a YouTube video published two days ago a well-dressed Peterson told viewers about his new book Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life and named a release date of March 2 2021.  Penguin Random House is slated to be the publisher of Peterson’s new book (which is sure to be an immediate best-seller). But the fact that their company would have the audacity to publish a self-help book by Peterson triggered Leftist employees prompting a fiery town hall where employees attacked the decision to publish the new book while its leaders attempted to defend the course of action VICE World News reported.  All of the employees who voiced concern over the publication presented weak arguments mostly settling on 1984-style Thought Police tactics or arguments reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451’s antagonists (both books the low-level employees should put on their reading lists).  A member of the LGBT community called Peterson an icon of hate speech transphobia and white supremacy adding to these evidence-free allegations “regardless of the content of his book I’m not proud to work for a company that publishes him.” Employees were reportedly in tears (and not the happy kind) due to “how Jordan Peterson has affected their lives” with one stating “the company since June has been doing all these anti-racist and allyship things and them publishing Peterson’s book completely goes against this.” According to VICE another employee shared “how Peterson had radicalized their father and another talked about how publishing the book will negatively affect their non-binary friend.” Penguin Random House has reportedly received over 70 anonymous messages regarding Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life with only a few notes in favor of publication.  Given that one Tweet was enough to get Abigail Shrier’s recent book Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters initially taken down from the shelves of Target more than 70 complaints is a lot in the world of companies caving to SJW demands. To be fair Penguin Random House still seems to be in favor of publishing Peterson’s book but the publishing company didn’t stand up to their censorship-touting employees either sensitively writing in an email: “We announced yesterday that we will publish Jordan Peterson’s new book Beyond Order this coming March. Immediately following the announcement we held a forum and provided a space for our employees to express their views and offer feedback. Our employees have started an anonymous feedback channel which we fully support. We are open to hearing our employees’ feedback and answering all of their questions. We remain committed to publishing a range of voices and viewpoints.” I believe it’s still up-in-the-air if Peterson’s book will be published (unfortunately). As the old saying goes “the squeaky wheel gets the oil” and right now SJW Penguin Random House employees are being very squeaky. There is still hope though. After all if there is anyone who has proved himself impervious to cancel-culture it’s Jordan Peterson.
