Different criteria have been used over the years to define aridity and to set the climatic boundaries of drylands [2]. The classification proposed by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) based on the aridity index (AI the ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration) is widely used nowadays [3]. According to this criterion drylands are defined as regions with an AI < 0.65 and are subdivided in four categories: hyper-arid (AI < 0.05) arid (0.05 < AI < 0.20) semi-arid (0.20 < AI < 0.50) and dry–subhumid (0.50 < AI < 0.65). Overall these areas cover 5.1 × 107 ha totalling 41 per cent of the land surface (see [1] for a detailed account of the area occupied by each dryland subtype). The climatic characteristics of drylands coupled with the relatively low fertility of their soils [4] impose important limitations on their biota [5]. As a consequence of these constraints dryland vegetation is typically sparse and forms a ‘two-phase’ mosaic (figure 1) where discrete vegetation patches mostly grasses and shrubs are separated by a matrix of bare ground and/or biological soil crusts (BSCs hereafter) dominated by lichens mosses and cyanobacteria [6]. The extensive areas devoid of vascular vegetation characterizing dryland landscapes their harsh climate and some environmental problems caused by the mismanagement of their natural resources (e.g. dust bowls and desertification; see [78]) have contributed to the general public's impression that drylands are unproductive and ‘useless’ ecosystems both from the ecological and socio-economical points of view [9].

While the term may bring to mind the windswept sand dunes of the Sahara or the vast salt pans of the Kalahari it’s an issue that reaches far beyond those living in and around the world’s deserts threatening the food security and livelihoods of more than two billion people. The combined impact of climate change land mismanagement and unsustainable freshwater use has seen the world’s water-scarce regions increasingly degraded. This leaves their soils less able to support crops livestock and wildlife.   Deserts Threatened by Climate Change Deborah Hill/ Science Nov. 2 2000 Desert plants go wild during wet years when treated to excess carbon dioxide researchers say. The finding backs up climate change models which predict that rising levels of atmospheric CO2 will disrupt the ecology of sensitive desert ecosystems. Experts fear that the change will favor invasive plants given to triggering wildfires. Plentiful CO2 helps plants use water more efficiently and atmospheric levels of CO2 are expected to double relative to preindustrial times by 2050. Global-warming researchers predict that such massive increases will eventually transform desert ecosystems. The boom in plant growth is expected to upset delicately balanced desert ecosystems--changing the nutrient cycle fire cycle and distribution of water. A research team led by ecologist Stanley Smith of the University of Nevada Las Vegas decided to check. They enriched levels of CO2 above three 23-meter-diameter plots by about 50%. Six similar plots served as controls. During the lush 1998 El Niño growing season and the subsequent drought of 1999 the researchers measured plant size density and seed production on the plots. Carbon dioxide didn't change plant growth much during the drought but it did during the wet year. All plants in the CO2 plots grew bigger and produced more seeds than those in control plots. However some plants took more advantage of the situation than others; invasive species such as cheatgrass doubled their density in wet high-CO2 conditions compared to native species such as fescue and peppergrass the researchers report in the 2 November issue of Nature. Long-term elevated CO2 levels could give exotic species a boost Smith says and extra plant matter means more fuel for fires.   While it is typical of Americans to think of deserts in simplistic (often cartoonish) terms there are cultures that have grown and thrived in deserts over centuries (sometimes millennia):  NATIVE PEOPLES > ATACAMEÑOS Chile Precolombino The Atacameños Atacamans or licantay which in their language means ‘the inhabitants of the territory’ are descendents of the extinct San Pedro culture which can be traced back at least 1500 years. At the start of the fifteenth century Inka ruler Túpac Yupanqui conquered their territory bringing new social and political structures and imposing sun worship as the new religion. The new rulers changed some of the old rituals exchanging the consumption of hallucinogenic plants for the use of Andean coca leaves. The Inkas also expanded their road network into the region connecting the Atacama salt flat with the Altiplano and mountainous territory of what is now northwestern Argentina. The indigenous population resisted the Spanish conquistadors when they first arrived in 1536 and it was not until twenty years later that the region was pacified through a peace treaty signed at Suipacha. Towards the end of the sixteenth century the Spanish colonial civilization reached the region bringing evangelization and two controversial customs of the conquistadors: encomiendas the subjugation of indigenous groups as serfs under a conquistador lord; and mercedes de tierra huge land grants made to the same Spanish nobles. The town of San Pedro de Atacama became a major political center for the region. Like so much else that is poised to be destroyed by technological capitalism modern colonialism the landscape and inhabitants of the Atacama are facing potentially irreversible damage: The Atacama Desert in Chile 🇨🇱 hosts some of the world’s best and largest reserves of lithium and potassium on recordHere is a timelapse showing the extension of the SQM Salar mining facility from 2015 to date pic.twitter.com/uY4y1wu3i9  Dave Sherwood/ Reuters AUGUST 14 2020  Indigenous groups in Chile´s lithium-rich Atacama salt flat fresh off a resounding legal victory earlier this week said on Friday they will push to see top lithium miner SQM´s environmental permits revoked and its operations shut down. The Atacama Indigenous Council (CPA) in 2019 filed a lawsuit demanding regulators scrap a $25 million remediation plan developed by SQM after officials charged the miner with over- pumping lithium-rich brine from the salt flat. The indigenous groups won but the regulator earlier this year appealed to Chile´s Supreme Court defending the SQM plan. On Wednesday however the regulator suddenly pulled out of the legal battle forcing SQM to start again from scratch on a new potentially tougher plan. The indigenous council an umbrella group for the native communities that ring the salt flat celebrated their victory but said it did not go far enough. “We will make every effort to see SQM´s [environmental permits] revoked” said council president Sergio Cubillos. “The damages committed by this company are immeasurable and they must assume their responsibility.”  Climate Change and its Effects on Desert Life The average rise in temperature can generally be around two to three degrees in the two polar deserts Antarctica and Arctic. As it relates to the subtropical deserts the Arabian Australian Kalahari and Sahara the temperatures can get up to about one hundred and seventeen degrees at times. These deserts are known to have little to no humidity. As for the Gobi desert located in Central Asia it has very dry lands but very cold temperatures at times because of its relation to the sea levels. Also it has to do with the fact that its spread across so many different areas. The changes in temperatures have had a relatively small impact on the weather but very drastic influences on the environments. Deserts typically have less than sixteen inches of rain a year. In the Artic and Antarctica they have been seeing increased rainfalls especially during their summer seasons. The rainfall has replaced what should regularly be snow fall. In your sub-tropical deserts you see decreased rainfalls and more heatwaves. The land is becoming drier and unsuitable for the system that usually thrives here. As for the Gobi desert it has started to have more frequent dust storms and that along with other causes has greatly diminished the quality of the air in that particular region.

Only 1% of the arable land in Mongolia is cultivated with crops. The agriculture sector therefore remains heavily focused on nomadic animal husbandry with 75% of the land allocated to pasture and cropping only employing 3% of the population. Dundgobi aimag (province) is located in the middle part of the Gobi Desert and is a vast dryland steppe with sparsely grown but highly nutritious grass such as wild leek and saxaul. The Oldokhiin Devjikh pastoralist community in Khuld soum (town) of Dundgobi has 64 pastoral household members. The community has collaborated with several scientists and is actively involved in some projects implemented by Mercy Corps since 2005 for planting trees such as elm and seabuckthorn bushes and vegetables. The community is a good example of surviving under challenging climate conditions. In this part of the Gobi Desert their initiatives involve building relationships between herding livestock in a traditional way and planting trees to cope with sand movement and land degradation and putting efforts into spring water conservation. This community is a member of Mongolian Alliance of Nomadic Indigenous Peoples (MANIP) which is a national network coordinated by pastoralist leaders supported by FAO`s Pastoralist Knowledge Hub programme.

This ancient event triggered by rapid drops in temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide permanently affected biological diversity in the region. Large areas of Mongolia (geographic) Tibet and north-western China suddenly became hyperarid deserts with little vegetation cover – and stayed that way for almost 20 million years. This was a surprising finding of new research I carried out with colleagues from across Europe and China in which we reconstructed the past 43 million years of evolutionary history for the steppe semi-desert and desert ecosystems of Central Asia (the biogeographical and political conceptions of “Central Asia” differ and we use the former: our research area is shown below). Many scientists had previously thought that this region was forested for much of that time and only grew drier later on culminating today in massive exceptionally arid Asian deserts such as the Gobi and Taklimakan. How far can we push the planet before it pushes back? Worst sandstorm in a decade chokes Beijing Sand and dust from the Gobi Desert are causing headaches for travelers on foot and by air. Sand and dust from the Gobi Desert and parts of northwestern China have cast much of the Chinese capital city of Beijing in yellow smog — lowering air quality to hazardous levels forcing hundreds of flights to be canceled and complicating the morning route for millions of commuters in what officials say is the worst sandstorm in a decade. Much of the sand swept in from a weekend sandstorm in Mongolia that left six dead and more than 80 reported missing. On Monday morning the Chinese National Meteorological Center announced a yellow alert for 12 provinces and cities asking residents to close windows and stay inside if possible. As many commuters made their way to work Beijing’s air quality was rated at the “hazardous” 999 level — emergency conditions according to the air quality index. Up to 100 is considered acceptable… Beijing’s colour today. Reminds me of SF’s colour during the fire last year. Same Bladerunner 2049 energy different environmental disasters. Dust Sand Storm & Desertification (DSSD) in the north + west China has to be outpaced by the efforts of building a Green Great Wall. 🌳 pic.twitter.com/hH7NraXwyK   Climate change in Mongolia destroying pastures on which nomadic herders rely Overgrazing and a cycle of summer drought and winter snow has degraded vital pastureland in Mongolia killing livestock and jeopardising livelihoods According to a government report 70% of pastoral land has been degraded with less variety of vegetation. The intensification of dry conditions has increased the frequency of forest fires which cut total forest area by 0.46% annually. As more pasture is absorbed into the vast Gobi desert the ancient herding lifestyle is disappearing with it. Paradoxically the more their way of life is put at risk the more herders engage in practices that put it in danger.  While some Mongolians continue herding others seek work in different industries and different places.The Gobi Desert and its mines attract foreign investment and a level of wealth previously unknown in this post-Soviet nation. https://t.co/1M4hR0u36S pic.twitter.com/JHn2mHWT3y  Other General Open Threads That Run In Daily Kos.
