L, GOP Rep. Criticizes Cardi B And She Minces No Words With Her Response, Lee Moran, 2021-04-23, Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) who declared Cardi B’s Grammy Awards performance of “WAP” with Megan Thee Stallion was “inconsistent with basic decency” received a sharp rebuke from the “Bodak Yellow” rapper herself. Cardi B hit back on Twitter Thursday slamming Grothman for failing to focus on more important issues such as police brutality. “They giving seats to FUCKIN IDIOTS!!!” she added. Grothman claimed on the House floor earlier on Thursday that he’d received complaints about last month’s televised Grammys performance saying “millions of Americans” would see it as “inconsistent with basic decency.” Rep. Glenn Grothman: "I receive complaints in my office and rightfully so about Cardi B in the Grammys… I assure the FCC that millions of Americans would view her performance as inconsistent with basic decency." pic.twitter.com/h4ONzEo98B “Wake up FCC and begin to do your job” demanded Grothman of the Federal Communications Commission. “The moral decline of America is partly due to your utter complacency.”  On Twitter Cardi B referenced this week’s conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. “I think we all been on the edge this week since we seen police brutality back to back including watching one of the biggest case in history go down DUE to police brutality” she wrote. “But wait! This is wat state representative decide to talk about.” This gets me so mad ya don’t even know!
