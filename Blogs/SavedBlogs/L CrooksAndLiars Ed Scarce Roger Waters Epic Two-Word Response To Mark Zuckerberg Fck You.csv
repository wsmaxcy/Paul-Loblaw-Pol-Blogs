Said Roger Waters “(It’s an) insidious movement of them to take over absolutely everything.” Well not the classic Pink Floyd song if Waters has anything to say about it. Source: National Post Pink Floyd star Roger Waters has rejected an offer from Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg for the use of his classic track Another Brick in the Wall Part II. The rocker has made it clear he’s not a fan of the Facebook co-founder and even the lure of a lucrative deal didn’t sway Waters. Speaking at an event linked to a campaign to free WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange Waters opened up about the offer from Zuckerberg who he called “one of the most powerful idiots in the world” revealing the Facebook boss wanted to use his 1979 song in a film to promote Instagram. “So it’s a missive from Mark Zuckerberg to me” Waters said. “Arrived this morning with an offer of a huge huge amount of money and the answer is ‘F–k you! No f–king way!’ Mark Zuckerberg personally asked Roger Waters for permission to use "Another Brick in the Wall" in an Instagram marketing campaign. This was Roger's response. pic.twitter.com/qsQZo1iWVJ — AlexDeLarge (@IWasCuredOK) June 14 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
