L, Right-Wing Extremists Planned An Organization Meeting Before Jan. 6 'Show', NewsHound Ellen, 2021-05-22, The charges against New Jersey Oath Keepers member James Breheny indicate that he invited founder Stewart Rhodes to a “leadership meeting of multiple patriot groups” in southeastern Pennsylvania on January 3rd BuzzFeed News reports.  Breheny also forwarded to Rhodes a message from an unnamed person saying “This will be the day we get our comms on point with multiple other patriot groups share rally points etc.”  If that meeting occurred BuzzFeed notes “it would suggest there was more coordination and preparation among anti-government groups than previously disclosed and potentially that the Oath Keepers worked in concert with other organizations." It’s not a shock that extremists got together or hoped to get together to plan for some kind of action on January 6. The big question is who they were working with and how far up the GOP food chain the organizing went. In January C&L’s Susie Madrak reported that the organizer of January 6th’s “Stop the Steal” rally Ali Alexander claimed he had help from three Republican congressmembers: Paul Gosar Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks. Alexander’s claim was made all the more plausible after his history with some high-level Republican operatives was exposed in March. Breheny has had some involvement with the Trump Republican Party too. According to BuzzFeed he appears to have run as a Republican (and lost) for a County Commission seat in 2016. He also provided “security and civilian protection” during Donald Trump’s 2017 inauguration. Fortunately one of the 13 other Oath Keepers arrested for involvement in the January 6 insurrection is reportedly cooperating with federal investigators. Perhaps he’ll give us a clue as to who else was involved in planning the insurrection. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
