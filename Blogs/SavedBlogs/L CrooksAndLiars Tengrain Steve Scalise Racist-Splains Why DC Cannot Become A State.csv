L, Steve Scalise Racist-Splains Why DC Cannot Become A State, Tengrain, 2021-04-25, David Duke Without The Baggage Rep. Steve Scalise (CKK – LA) steps up to the Craps Table to throw the white dice to explain why majority Black Washington DC cannot become a state. Be prepared for a shock Gentle Readers it’s as racist as eff! In a memo on DC statehood House Minority Whip Steve Scalise argues against it based on DC's crime rate claiming the district "can't perform basic governmental duties like protecting its residents from criminals" pic.twitter.com/vwWPkGnV4Q — Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) April 21 2021 Snake Eyes! The blahs are violent is his implication! (Also one can look up the crime statics in Scalise’s Louisiana and lo! carjackings happen there too. Also.) If there’s one thing we learned from the January 6 Stupid Coup it’s that the DC has limited autonomy …by decree of Congress. Scalise having lost that round throws the white dice again! Scalise also argues the district is "not ready for statehood" because it "relies heavily on Congress to ensure its financial solvency and local leaders are not ready for Congress to rescind funding for local projects and initiatives." pic.twitter.com/57LvXHtboE — Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) April 21 2021 SNAKE EYES! The blahs are moochers according to Scalise when in fact DC is funded by Congress and has no autonomy to raise money nor ability to redirect it as needed. It is beholden to Congress. Anyway I’ll say one thing for Scalise: he’s consistently on-brand as David Duke with or without the baggage. Republished with permission of Mock Paper Scissors.
