L, Deaf & Black woman handcuffed by North Las Vegas police as her children forced to interpret., MarcKyle64, 2021-04-20, Covid-19 has been harder on people with hearing losses than you might expect. A portion of how we (I have had a hearing loss since  birth) understand others is by reading lips. It’s not as effective as portrayed in movies & TV studies have found that a MAXIMUM understanding is about 10-45% and it can be much much less depending on beards ambient lighting (an important point in the diary) and the speaker. BUT it still makes a big difference when understanding a conversation is iffy. Masks totally obliterate this. When Andrea Hollingsworth was given commands by North Las Vegas police wearing masks around 10:40pm on April 7 she didn’t understand them. She was then handcuffed and her 11 year old children were forced by the arresting officers to interpret a DOJ ADA AND NLVPD violation of established procedures and laws. That’s right they completely deprived her of her ability to communicate. And let’s not kid ourselves the NLVPD has the resources to have a dedicated interpreter on-call from someone in the area. Do you really think they’ve never dealt with anyone who signs or doesn’t speak English before?? It all started when she went to visit her old place to get her unused rent back but her ‘friend’ called the NLVPD and reported she was being “harassed and stalked” and was “afraid for her safety”. Police responded to her address where Hollingsworth was waiting in her car. Pulled out of her car pushed down to the curb and not able to understand what she was being told the police told her petrified 11 year old twin daughters to translate that she needs to put her hands behind her back. Understanding that she was about to be completely deprived of the ability to communicate and in fear for her life Hollingsworth struggled and was subsequently handcuffed as police said “One of you guys need to talk some sense into her.”. Her crying daughters tried to explain the situation to another officer but the video ended at that point. NLVPD claimed that they investigated the incident writing Hollingsworth “initially refused to comply with requests and was briefly detained until police completed their investigation.” Andrea’s Facebook video has over 75000 views and comments mostly condemned the NLVPD for their unprofessionalism and poor procedures. Using children to interpret except in emergencies is not acceptable and was in fact a violation of the NLVPD’s own policies and procedures. Andrea says she was in fear of her life and thanks her children for saving her. “I really want all of Las Vegas police to change because it is really scary how deaf people are treated. If my kids weren’t with me then I would have died that day. My kids saved my life” Hollingsworth said. She knew this could have turned out much worse as police departments do NOT have an exemplary record in their dealings with people who are Deaf or Hard-Of-Hearing. Being Black & Deaf is a double whammy. I have a letter in my car that I keep with my registration and insurance information telling the reader that I’m hearing impaired and that reading lips or yelling words won’t work as a means of communicating with me. If I’m ever pulled over for a traffic violation it may save my life.  (Edit) Don’t bother commenting on the NLVPD Facebook page about this. They deleted my comment quickly. It’s filled with their ‘hey lookit how much we’re doing for the community’ PR BS.
