L, IAN: June 27 2021 - it's hot, loggersbratforItzl Alert Network, 2021-06-26,   As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos.  It's also so we can find other Kossacks nearby for in-person checks when other methods of communication fail - a buddy system. Members come here to check in.  If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we and your buddy are going to check up on you.  If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here.  We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries.  Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime!  We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group!  Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! ************************* Unlocking nixtamal.  Food glorious food fabulous food.  Fascinating article. Are we cut out for universal morality?  A recent study. Future Crunch put some good stuff in my email recently. Your gym teacher was wrong.  Stretching before a workout isn’t always a good thing. Excavations for a new subway line keep bringing Roman history to light. DAMWeather’s take on the current PNW heatwave.  Short version:  it’s hella hot. ************************* I’ve gotten some fairly grotty long-put-off chores done with some help from the kids.  They were expecting to be paid for it and they were — but the work was done to my specifications and before my new mattress arrives. I was planning to take more time about getting this stuff done; but the mattress is coming fairly soon.  In fact it will probably be here on Wednesday.  On the day I will have to move a couple of fans and the cabinet that holds my sheets; but everything else is clear between the front door and my bedroom. Only one thing wasn’t finished by the end of the day on Friday and that will have to wait till the temperatures go down again next week. ************************* I found out this past week that the basic definition of “novel” among publishers is over 40000 words.  The fanfic I’ve been writing (no I have no plans to publish and there are only a few people I might let read it) is over 112K so far.  It’s about time to let it sit for a while — I need to see if I can revise some parts to be more action and less observation.  It’s still fun and I’m still learning a lot about myself. I’m buying some more stuff.  The bathsheets have arrived.  Very expensive but I think they will last for years and I can now toss a couple of my older towels. I’ve also bought more dragon t-shirts.  I’m wearing the one that says “Be the kind of woman that when your feet hit the floor in the morning the devil says ‘Oh crap she’s up’.”  It was the dragon that convinced me it wasn’t a seriously Christianist shirt. *************************
