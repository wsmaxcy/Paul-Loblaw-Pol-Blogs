L, Kos Diabetes Group: Insulin Price Caps, lynnekz, 2021-04-23, It’s a sad fact that in the richest country in the world 1 of 4 diabetics risk their lives because they need to ration their insulin due to its high cost.  Why is the cost of insulin so high?  The $27 billion global insulin market is a monopoly controlled by three companies: Sanofi Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. They can fix their prices and appear to increase them in lockstep with one another.  There's no generic option available. Because insulin is a biological product and not a chemical one it's harder to produce a generic version. The big three companies use 'pay for delay' schemes where they pay potential biosimilar manufacturers not to enter the market. They then surround their insulin patent with lots of other patents to make the original patent last longer a practice known as 'evergreening'. They also spend millions on lobbying each year to prevent policymakers from closing any of these loopholes. In May 2019 Colorado became the first state to cap insulin copays for diabetics with private insurance.  As of March 2021 the following states have enacted insulin price caps:    This wave of state insulin caps parallels Medicare’s recent pilot program that caps monthly insulin costs at $35. Many lawmakers hail these bills as a solution while failing to acknowledge just how few people can actually benefit. There are two big sticking points of these laws: States are only able to regulate their own insurance plans such as those offered by state government agencies to employees churches or other specific state-designed plans offered only to particular groups. But the reality is that more than 60% of job-offered insurance plans across the country are federally regulated by something known as ERISA or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This federal law sets minimum standards for most of the employer-provided health and retirement plans. These are considered to be “self-funded” plans governed by ERISA meaning the employer takes on some of the financial responsibility for the plans it offers. As a result people with diabetes who have ERISA-governed plans are not able to take advantage of the insulin copay cap within their particular state.  Diabetics have shown up at local pharmacies expecting a lower price tag only to face pharmacist confusion and continued high prices because their insurance plan isn’t impacted by a new copay cap law. Other people have gone so far as to move to a new state to take advantage of a price cap law only to discover they’re not eligible for the discount. For diabetics with private health insurance the three big insulin manufacturers have programs to help patients with the cost of their insulin. Sanofi provides out-of-pocket caps to anyone with commercial insurance and patients without insurance allowing them to purchase multiple Sanofi insulins for a fixed price of $99 per month up to 10 boxes of pens and/or 10-mL vials.   Eli Lilly caps some insulins at $35 for the uninsured or commercially insured patients.  Novo Nordisk has an insulin program where eligible patients pay $99 for a monthly supply of any combination of Novo Nordisk insulin products (up to 3 vials or 2 packs of pens).  If your state hasn’t yet enacted insulin price caps call or write your state senator and delegates and ask them to write legislation to cap the insulin costs for your state.
