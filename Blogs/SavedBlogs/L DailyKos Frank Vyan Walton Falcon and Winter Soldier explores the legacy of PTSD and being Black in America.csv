L, Falcon and Winter Soldier explores the legacy of PTSD and being Black in America, Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-04-18, Marvel Studios has been with us for well over a decade and it keeps growing more and more sophisticated. Drawing from over 50 years of comic stories they have a wide swath of ideas to work with and they proceed to do a deep dive into those stories with their latest Disney Plus series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Packed with both action and a great deal of heart the series pushes deeply into the sad legacy of black people in America what it truly would mean for a black man to wield the symbol of being “Captain America” who had historically been blonde and blue eyed and also both the light and dark side of struggling with ongoing traumatic effects of PTSD from prolonged violent combat. If you haven’t seen Captain America: Civil War  Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: End Game you might feel a tad bit out of the loop with the start of this series. Let just sum it up as an giant purple alien gathered together a set of mystical stones snapped his fingers and eliminated half the life in the galaxy.  Five years later the Avengers eventually undid his handiwork and brought everyone back but that created a whole new conflict as the world changed significantly while people were gone. The concept of the nation-state collapsed.  The human race became one. One world. One People. Things changed.  And then with the return of those who were lost it changed again.  People who had moved into the empty spaces apartments jobs lives of those who were gone were displaced placed in refugee camps — shuffled around from country to country. Homeless. Based on a male “Flag Smasher” character from the Captain America comics Karli Morganthou is the leader of a movement to gain freedom and autonomy for displaced persons.  They battle against the powers that be — they steal medicine food and supplies that were supposed to have been distributed to the displaced but remain locked in warehouses out of sight out of mind.  They’re willing to do whatever it takes and it apparently it takes quite a bit.   Also several of them including Karli have been empowered with a new batch of the Super Soldier Serum that powered the original Captain America Steve Rogers. Sam Wilson and James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes stand in opposition to them but not in disagreement with their goals only in disagreement with their methods. Both men had been partners with Steve Rogers during different eras.  Bucky had been the sniper for Steve’s team during WWII who was lost during a dramatic attack on a train.  He’d lost his arm in the battle and had been captured and brainwashed by their opponent: Hydra. He became their slave and for the next 90 years was used as their super-powered assassin then put on ice between missions.  Eventually with the help of Steve and Sam he was freed of his servitude and programming but he is not yet whole still suffering from crippling nightmares of the damage he inflicted on the lives of many including those who were innocent bystanders as he rampaged on his missions.  Sam was an Air Force vet who met Steve after he had been thawed from spending 70 years in Ice.  They became friends and eventually partners as Steve battled against the Hydra operatives who had burrowed their way into halls of SHIELD the world defense and intelligence organization which had been founded and led by the love of Steve’s life Peggy Carter. Ok so that’s a lot. Marvel has done a great job of taking these fairly fantastical stories and making them feel grounded in the real world within a real world perspective.  At one point Sam argues with Bucky that they may be facing “One of the Big Three: Aliens Androids or Wizards.”  At which point Bucky argues “there’s no such thing as Wizards” only to have Sam answer “There’s Dr. Strange.”  Bucky; “He’s a sorcerer.”  Sam: “A sorcerer is a wizard without a hat.” Additional characters in the story involve Capt. John Walker US Army who gets chosen to carry the shield and mantle of Captain America by the US government after Sam donates the shield he was given by Steve to the Smithsonian as well as his partner Lt. Lemar Hoskins.  Sharon Carter the niece of Peggy Carter who had aided Steve and Sam during “Civil War” and lost her position with SHIELD and the CIA becomes persona non grata and has been on the run to the outlaw state of Madripoor where she seems to now run a shady underground organization. Former Sokovian Special Forces Operative Baron Helmut Zemo who had blamed the Avengers for the destruction of his nation and family during Avengers: Age of Ultron  who had used Bucky’s Hydra programming to manipulate him in his effort to get revenge in “Civil War” but who is now a potential asset as Sam and Bucky try to track down the origin of the Super Soldier Serum used by the Flag-Smashers and finally Isaiah Bradley a former black US Soldier who was experimented on by the government in a effort to test and recreate the serum used on Steve Rogers who had fought for his country — even against Bucky in his former guise as the Winter Soldier — and saved his fellow black soldiers against orders only to be jailed and experimented on for decades despite his heroism. For Sam he gets told by Isaiah that the world will “Never Accept a Black man as Captain America and no self-respecting Black man would want to be.” We have scenes where police accost Sam and Bucky while they’re having an argument asking Bucky ; “Is this man bothering you?” to which he answers “No. Do you know who this is?” It’s only because Sam is an Avenger that he gets respect from the police.  He struggles with this advice as well as struggling with the financial trouble that his sister is in with their families house and fishing boat.  They try to get a loan from the bank that their parents had dealt with for decades only to be denied because Sam has had no income for the last five years.  But then it’s hard to have an income when you don’t physically exist thanks to the Snap. Bucky is plagued with nightmarish flashbacks to his decades as the Winter Soldier assassin attending court required therapy sessions to try and relieve his internal stress which are largely ineffective.  Yet he still strives to connect with people to connect with a world he hasn't truly been a part of since the 40’s. The story is a thriller but one without cartoon heroes and villains every person has their own motivation and their own justification for their actions.  All of them are to one extent or another understandable and sympathetic — but they have different goals different methods.  Ultimately they remain in opposition in conflict and that conflict will ultimately be resolved next Friday as the final episode is streamed on Disney Plus.  **Spoilers**      And more….    And More….
