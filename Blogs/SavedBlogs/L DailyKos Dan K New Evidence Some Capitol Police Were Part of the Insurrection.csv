L, New Evidence Some Capitol Police Were Part of the Insurrection, Dan K, 2021-04-21, We’re hearing lots of reports about just how many cops and military types were part of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. There was also some indication that some of the Capitol Police management was in on it. Now there’s more disturbing news from the House Administration Committee: Lofgren: Capitol Police official being investigated for directions to pursue only 'anti-Trump' protesters Jan. 6 A Capitol Police official radioed units outside of the building on the morning of Jan. 6 and told them only to scout for anti-Trump troublemakers — not pro-Trump protesters according to the findings of an internal investigation revealed at a public hearing by Rep. Zoe Lofgren. Lofgren (D-Calif.) revealed the finding while she questioned Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton who appeared before the House Administration Committee Wednesday to testify about security failures that precipitated the Jan. 6 attack. Lofgren who chairs the panel described the findings as she asked him whether he had read the internal investigation reports. Specifically police were instructed NOT to interfere with the pro-Trump mob but just to keep any anti-Trump people (assuming there were any!) from messing with the overthrow: The department's Office of Professional Responsibility found that a radio transmission to "all outside units' attention" that they should not be "looking for any pro-Trump in the crowd" according to Lofgren. She added they were "only looking for any anti-Trump." Tie this in with Newsweek’s report of last week: Report Finds Capitol Police Ordered Not to Use Crowd Disbursement Weapons During Riot Members of the U.S. Capitol Police were ordered not to use weapons intended to disperse rioters during the January 6 riot according to an internal report released in March by Inspector General Michael Bolton that was obtained by the Associated Press. The report said that although these orders came from "leadership" the weapons were considered "less lethal because they could have aided the Capitol Police to push back advancing rioters and were not meant to kill. Don’t use riot control techniques and materiel. Make sure the anti-Trumpers don’t interfere. (While Trump keeps the National Guard out of the way.) And Republicans doing their damdest to keep Congress from investigating it. How many more pieces do we need to make a case for sedition?
