L, The NYT Report on Jan 6th this is a 40 minute video of the Insurrection Explained in detail, eeff, 2021-07-01, I was surfing twitter & clicked on a tweet. It took me to this Video of the 6 month investigation the New York Times did. it doesn’t have a fire wall with this link at this time. It is well worth your time to watch it. I just did that. NYT's Video the Video is 40 minutes There is not much more to add. It shows more of how this happened in one video then I’ve ever watched.  I should have took names of the stars in this video who at minimum should spend 10 years locked up! I won’t be able to watch it again till after midnight because of internet connection. So if you add the names of the stars of the riot in this video I’ll add them in the body. I think those main rioters should get to spend at least 10 years locked up!
