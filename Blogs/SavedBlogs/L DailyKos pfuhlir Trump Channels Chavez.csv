L, Trump Channels Chavez, pfuhlir, 2021-06-27, Trump Channels Chavez: Satire By Lyer Fibski & Propagandovitch famous Moscow PR outlet For immediate release: In an exclusive statement from his Mara Lago lair the Former Guy Donald Trump reminisced wistfully about his days as capo di tutti capi. It was one of those rare moments when he did not assert his Big Lie and there was no ceremony there to hijack. “I think it’s high time that I paid my respects to Hugo Chavez” the ex-POTUS-in-exile intoned. “He doesn’t get the broad recognition he deserves. Like me. He ran for President after he attempted a coup and won! And he gave all those long speeches. He wasn’t President for life for nothing! I love that guy.”  “I mean they named a ravine after him didn’t they?” he continued. “Besides I love the Valenzuelans—GREAT BEAUTY CONTESTANTS. And it was Latin Americans like Chavez who invented juntas—my kind of strong leadership! Too bad they all speak Latin.”
