L, The Daily Bucket - Spring photos ground to sky, CaptBLIforBackyard Science, 2021-05-09,       Good morning.  A naturally talented person will photograph what the rest of us dream of and are attracted to.  Hay seed (that some of you also know as Jeff) provided me with a treasure trove of his photo files to arrange and condense.  The title picture was included in the mix.  Here are some other shots of the same Kite after a little “tweaking” with light and clarifying. .        Here is a short 10 second video of an Osprey in flight.    From that same time period came these marvelous still photographs.   There are more to that series but I had lots of his work to review.  We can show the other Osprey photos later.  Here are some other things he had in his files. Red tail Hawks in a 30 second video is next.   This Beaver popped up along the shore. A few photos of a Hummingbird to change the pace.    Now for odd and ends.  All of these are shots I would be glad to have taken but am happy to see them at all.   The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge. We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below.  Orange dots moving upward from the leaf litter.  Within a few seconds this film may surprise you.   The balance to the video above can be found near the ground. And now for the bug of the day.  This mimic (of a Bumble bee) is a Robber Fly — Laphria thoracica.  A carnivore that feeds mostly on plant eating insects.  Having a loud buzzing flight from it’s thick membrane wings is typical.  Is known to attack prey in flight and pierce it’s victim with its proboscis then inject an enzyme to liquefy the internal organs of the prey.  I have enjoyed showing Hay seed’s photos with you.  Let us know what is going on in your area.
