L, Carbon Profiteering in the Virtual World: Bitcoin is a global warming over-achiever., ian douglas rushlau, 2021-07-06,  There's an important reason why every person praising this thread is somehow invested in bitcoin and every energy expert responding to it is either exasperated or infuriated. Bitcoin mining being a net positive to the environment = climate denial grade misinformation https://t.co/xTCBx7l8lW   If a way can be found to make a profit by rendering our one and only planet uninhabitable carbon profiteers will find a way. Even in the pristine confines of digital space. Tim De Chant gives us the crime scene report at Ars Technica:  The fossil fuel power plant that a private equity firm revived to mine bitcoin is at it again. Not content to just pollute the atmosphere in pursuit of a volatile crypto asset with little real-world utility this experiment in free marketeering is also dumping tens of millions of gallons of hot water into glacial Seneca Lake in upstate New York. “The lake is so warm you feel like you’re in a hot tub” Abi Buddington who lives near the Greenidge power plant told NBC News… Atlas the firm that bought Greenidge has been ramping up its bitcoin mining aspirations over the last year and a half installing thousands of mining rigs that have produced over 1100 bitcoin as of February 2021. The company has plans to install thousands more rigs ultimately using 85 MW of the station’s total 108 MW capacity.  Seneca Lake’s water isn’t the only thing the power plant is warming. In December 2020 with the power plant running at just 13 percent of its capacity Atlas’ bitcoin operations there produced 243103 tons of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases a ten-fold increase from January 2020 when mining commenced. NOx pollution which is responsible for everything from asthma lung cancer and premature death also rose 10x. Turning a glacial lake into a hot tub? No worries we got your state permits right here: Greenidge has a permit to dump 135 million gallons of water per day into the Keuka Lake Outlet as hot as 108˚ F in the summer and 86˚ F in the winter. New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation reports that over the last four years the plant’s daily maximum discharge temperatures have averaged 98˚ in summer and 70˚ in winter. That water eventually makes its way to Seneca Lake where it can result in tropical surface temps and harmful algal blooms. Residents say lake temperatures are already up though a full study won't be completed until 2023.  Let's discuss the environmental cost of bitcoin. Because despite all the push for sustainable and green investment in the tech sector there's a giant smoldering Chernobyl sitting at the heart of Silicon Valley which a lot of investors would prefer you remain quiet about. 🧵 (1/)  I mean how much effect can a faux money scam advanced currency trading system that exists in the realm of software shell games  digital transactions possibly have? Welp… The Hard Math Behind Bitcoin's Global Warming Problem  WIRED 12/15/17 One bitcoin which doesn’t actually have a real physical form is worth at this moment upwards of $16000. But to get one you either have to buy them from online exchanges or use specialized computing hardware to “mine” it. That last bit is where the freak-out comes in. In a report last week the cryptocurrency website Digiconomics said that worldwide bitcoin mining was using more electricity than Serbia. The country. Writing for Grist Eric Holthaus calculated that by July 2019 the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network—remember BitTorrent? Like that—would require more electricity than all of the United States. And by November of 2020 it’d use more electricity than the entire world does today. That’s bad. It means Bitcoin emits the equivalent of 17.7 million tons of carbon dioxide every year a big middle finger to Earth’s climate and anyone who enjoys things like coastlines forests and not dying of mosquito-borne diseases. Refracted through a different metaphor the Bitcoin P2P network is essentially a distributed superintelligence utterly dedicated to generating bitcoins so of course it wants to convert all the energy (and therefore matter) in the universe into bitcoin. That is literally its job. And if it has to recruit greedy nerds by paying them phantom value well OK. Unleash the hypnocurrency!… In the beginning cryptocurrency enthusiasts could run mining software on their home computers. That evolved. First people realized that graphics processing units were better at those hash computations than plain old CPUs. They used more power and required more elaborate cooling but still. And then people started customizing Field Programmable Gate Array chips bought off the shelf and then customized for mining. These days the preferred hardware is Application-Specific Integrated Circuits made to order in Bitcoin-specific configurations and installed in specialized data centers. Not only does that centralize bitcoin mining but it also screws up energy usage. The most advanced bitcoin miners now expend 0.3 watts per billion hash calculations or “gigahashes.” Flip that math around and you get 300 Gh per second per kilowatt. So the sketch is basically 13600 petahashes per second with 234 kWh consumed by every transaction giving you 32.71 terawatt-hours consumed by the Bitcoin network—or 0.15 percent of the total world consumption of electricity… Miners took advantage of faster more efficient hardware not to use less electricity but to do more mining. That’s how people always deploy more energy-efficient technologies. It happened with steam. It happened with oil. It's happening with LEDs—they’re more energy-efficient but their introduction hasn’t reduced overall power used for lighting. People have just installed more brighter lights. “The greater the value of a bitcoin the more electricity people will be willing to spend to compete for it” says Michael Taylor a computer scientist at the University of Washington. “Increasing the energy efficiency of bitcoin SHA-256 mining hardware helps only sublinearly as improving energy efficiency simply means people can deploy more miners at the same operating cost.”  Climate scientists have estimated that #Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C. And this is just one of *hundreds* of other cryptocurrency networks that run on this apocalyptically wasteful set of ideas. (14/)https://t.co/N8sHUkHPda  In addition to the energy waste and CO2 emitted the mining process itself requires constant replacement of hardware and produces a steady stream of waste from broken and exhausted computer parts. All of which are full of toxins and rare earth metals. (11/)
