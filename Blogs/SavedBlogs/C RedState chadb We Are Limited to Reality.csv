C, We Are Limited to Reality, chadb, 2020-11-06, I wish voter fraud was not happening in Pennsylvania.  I wish voter fraud was not happening in Nevada.  I wish voter fraud was not happening in Michigan.  I wish the Judiciary would force the elections to be free and fair.  I wish attorneys general would prosecute voter fraud.  I wish the Senate would refuse to acknowledge the electors from states with rampant voter fraud.  I could go on but you get the point. The problem is that I have no ability to affect any of those things.  Do I wish Donald J. Trump would be recognized as the real winner of Tuesday’s election?  Absolutely.  Am I frustrated that our semi-democratic society was not up to giving him a large enough margin to overcome fraud?  Again yes.  However I am limited to reality and the reality is that votes counted this year will probably overcome valid votes and nothing I say or do can change that. That said there are several states that are going to be targeted for fraud that have Republican legislatures and Republican governors.  Florida Ohio Georgia South Carolina Texas New Hampshire Iowa Indiana I’m looking at you.  Every one of you has areas where Democrats will do in 2022 what they did this year in Las Vegas Philadelphia Miami and so on.  If you want free and fair elections you need to do the following… I said above report nothing until there is a final result.  Somewhat… If one of the candidates is leading by more than the remaining number of voters then go ahead and release the results. Points of weakness: Since the mail-in ballot is difficult to protect to the same level as the in-person it really should be minimized. Again Florida Ohio Tennessee New Hampshire etc.  If you don’t act right now to secure your vote you will be screwed by your big cities just like Michigan.  I can’t change any of this.  You can.
