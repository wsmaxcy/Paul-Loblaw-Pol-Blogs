L, Denial Styles: Daily Caller Deflects Breitbart Distorts and Fox News Says Nothing Matters, ClimateDenierRoundup, 2021-05-03, Defined by a negative climate denial can be hard to define concisely. But often different outlets tend to express distinct editorial outlooks that reflect different styles of denial. Last week three pieces from the Daily Caller Breitbart and Fox News made for particularly illustrative cases of their brands' different approaches to their work.  Fox News opinion columnist Liz Peek seized on a comment President Biden made when he acknowledged the global part of global warming that the US can’t solve it alone and we need to work with others. Even if Biden said “we do everything perfectly it’s not going to matter” without the rest of the world’s cooperation in reducing emissions. Strip the comment of that context though and you can make it sound like there’s no point to anyone taking action as opposed to the reality that we all need to do everything it takes to reduce emissions to zero.  As a leader in rightwing propaganda Fox knows what its doing — appealing to its base’s base denial that climate action is worth anything much less the infinity dollars they say it will cost while also sending a demoralizing signal to those adjacent to its base. If you’re not sure about climate change but hear that even the President admits it’s pointless to act then it’s easy to justify simply tuning out on the issue all together.  Meanwhile at the much newer Daily Caller their strategy is still to try and appear as legitimate and mainstream-friendly as possible but while serving up decidedly right-leaning opinion as news. They have to make themselves seem as credible as possible because their history as a bootlicking tool of the Koch marketing department and a suspicious fundraising and tax shelter gimmick means anyone too smart will see them as the blatant conservative propaganda they are. But this projection was on full display last week with their publishing of their co-founder and publisher Niel Patel’s op-ed about how the ”misinformation about climate change foisted on the American people” in the mainstream media’s climate reporting is worse than the right’s lies about Biden banning burgers.  (He wrote it for Creators.com and totally coincidentally the only two outlets that seemed to run the syndicated piece as of Sunday evening were the Caller and RealClearPolitics part of the RealClear group that’s now also collecting Koch checks. Edit: On Monday the Daily Signal “media” arm of the Koch-funded Heritage Foundation also ran the piece.)  Patel is mad about the beef lies saying that “conservatives need to be more careful on the facts” but not because facts are important but because they “walked into a hailstorm of criticism that could easily have been avoided.” Got that? It’s not that lying is bad it's that lying so badly that there are headlines like “Nation’s Imbeciles Lose Their Minds Over Fake News Biden Is Taking Their Red Meat Away” is counterproductive to their political goals.  That pretense of politeness is what often separates the Daily Caller from some of its peers for example the much more openly racist Breitbart. The brand known for its “Black Crime” tab isn’t exactly known for subtlety and as it lacks dirty energy’s dirty money it doesn’t address climate all that often. The two exceptions are the racist-loving racist and UK columnist James Delingpole and when climate can be used in their culture war. For example John Notle published a whole screed last week doing his best Paul Revere impression and warning that “the environmental war against live concerts has begun”!  Nolte excerpts four sentences from a Guardian story he doesn’t link to about how virtual “global livestream” events instead of a leg of a tour “is one possibility” and that “tours could be routed more efficiently” and local artists supported better. The horror!  So while the Guardian story that he doesn’t link to is about about how many in the music industry are thinking about the climate crisis as concerts start becoming an option again Nolte  claimed to discover that “fascist greenies have fallen in love with how the government’s terrible anti-science lockdowns decreased carbon emissions and now they want to seize this opportunity by guilting DJs and bands and their fans into staying home… forever.”  In this piece which Nolte opens with a paraphrasing of Charles Dickens then spends like ten paragraphs hand-wringing about his imagined fear that someone’s coming for his concert tickets he laments “all this hand-wringing” by artists over the climate hoax and the idea that artists would make use of livestream is “just more proof that these tyrants have zero respect for and concerns about the human spirit. People gathering for a shared experience is something as old as mankind itself.”  Now some might argue that opening up a concert to people who can’t be there in person is actually widening the circle of those who can be part of that shared experience. People can now share the show even during a global pandemic. It also is a way to provide access for people with a physical disability or a lack of finances for a pricey ticket or those who may not have time to go out in the evening because of family but can still watch and listen or those that just prefer it because there’s never a line for the bathroom on Couch Tour and the drinks are cheaper!  But not Nolte. For him it’s “anti-fun” and apparently streaming a concert online just like how “we can’t tell jokes anymore… Tobacco is evil. Ogling beautiful women is ‘rape.’ Flirting proves you’re a ‘predator.’” Are you angry (about the fascist greenies) yet? No? Well then apparently you’re not Nolte’s target audience: easily-triggered tobacco-smoking perverts.  Y’know now that we think about it the one thing missing from the livestream experience is the ability for skeevy men to rub up on captivated young women in the crowd. Of course we're not saying Nolte is pissed because he wants to go to concerts so that he can assault women. But if we were it’d just be a joke so Nolte couldn’t be mad about it right?
