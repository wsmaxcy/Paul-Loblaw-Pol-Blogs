L, Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Evaluation today at the CDC. What is your recommendation?, AKALib, 2021-04-23, For those who are interested the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is meeting today to make a decision on the J&J (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine. The meeting started at 11:00 a.m. ET and will finish around 5:00 p.m. ET with a final vote. They have gone through some detailed presentations and analysis conducted by various experts and currently they are in the final discussion and Q&A phase. Here are the 4 Policy Options on the table - You can watch and listen to the discussions at www.ustream.tv/… My sense is that #4 is what the experts are leaning towards. #2 would be the 2nd choice. There are many factors in play besides the obvious ones of risk vs benefits of administering the vaccine. There are also concerns about implementation communication creating awareness access to the vaccine by various demographic groups and difficulties in implementing #3 and #4. Some more info on the briefings today Some data on the blood-clotting issue — From CDC ACIP: Confirmed reports of this thrombosis + thrombocytopenia seem to be clustered in the mid-late thirties (which happens to be my age group).... Median age 37. 12 involved blood clots in the brain (CVST). No clear links with existing blood clotting disorders. pic.twitter.com/uvY2C3aH98 The above slide shows some of the risk factors that were present in the affected patients. These risk factors are associated with blood clots in general and also with COVID-19 infections. Important slide from CDC ACIP meeting: These are the confirmed cases of thrombosis (blood clot) combined with thrombocytopenia (low platelets) in the nearly 8 million doses of Johnson & Johnson #vaccine. NOTE: All 15 cases thus far are in women with 13 in those under 50. pic.twitter.com/KkPmiI25Es Because of the pause Americans are now much less likely to prefer the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine Here is a twitter thread with a comprehensive summary of the day’s proceedings - In the US the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is meeting at the moment to discuss data on the rare clotting disorders seen after immunization with J&J’s #covid19 vaccine and to make recommendations on future use of the vaccine.I’ll tweet along a bit. Another detailed thread by Helen Branswell — 15. Another look at the risks-benefits. These estimates are per month. pic.twitter.com/rzwDb8NRZn Some background The CDC last week had recommended to states to pause use of the J&J vaccine because of 15 confirmed cases of rare and severe blood clots. All the cases were in women including three who died and 7 who remain in the hospital. The 15 cases include the 6 cases of blood clots previously identified by officials in women between the ages of 18 and 48. The 15 cases were identified among nearly 8 million doses of the vaccine administered as of April 21. ACIP ACIP is a committee within the CDC and is comprised of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the civilian population of the United States. ACIP statements are official federal recommendations for the use of vaccines and immune globulins in the U.S. and are published by the CDC. References Update Option #2 it is. The pause has been lifted. BREAKING: The US should resume Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccinations with warning notice CDC advisory committee says. https://t.co/VQUbnRLzw7 The ACIP meeting has been adjourned. But you can still vote in the poll. CDC director Rochelle Walensky will have to make the final approval. The vaccine will probably be available for use early next week. The CDC and FDA will need to publish education and communication materials and updated guidance for healthcare providers. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) earlier this week stated that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should carry a warning but placed no restrictions on its use. The EMA said that the shot’s benefits continue to outweigh the risks.
