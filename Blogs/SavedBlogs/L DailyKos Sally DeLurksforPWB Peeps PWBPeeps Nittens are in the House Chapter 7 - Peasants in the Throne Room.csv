L, PWBPeeps: Nittens are in the House Chapter 7 - Peasants in the Throne Room, Sally DeLurksforPWB Peeps, 2021-07-01, “I am Princess Violet. This is my domain and my lofty throne!” “Look upon me in dread you peasants!” “Wait! What are you doing? Are those pitchforks?” {Censored} (We prefer to not show violence owing to the potential of shocking all good PWBs.) (ok ok...a small scuffle ensued and I didn’t get any good pics)  “Those were very good claws and teeth! We don’t need no stinkin’ pitchforks!” “I’m a usurper baby!” “That’s okay. I’ll retreat to the Summer Palace!” “I’ll even share if you’ll be nice…” Griffin agrees but he wants the top bunk!  Happy July everybody! My personal good news today is that in my previous world this would have been the busiest day leading into the busiest month of every year; fiscal year-end. Since I retired recently I have specifically planned today as a sit-on-my-butt-and-do-nothing-all-day-long day. Let’s celebrate! (Consider this an outrageously long string of emoticons!) This is Part 9 of a multi-part series named Nittens are in the House. Links to previous episodes are below. Please join me here on Thursday mornings and allow me to share my wonderful fur family with you.
