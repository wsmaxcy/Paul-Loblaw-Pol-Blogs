L, One of the many reasons why getting vaccinated is so important., EdFlynn, 2021-04-21, I don’t know about other folks but I’ve been getting pretty sick of figuring out different ways to comb my long mangy locks. I get my second vaccine shot tomorrow and barring any unforeseen side effects like urges to go lick doorknobs or growing a third hand from the top of my head I’ll be heading straight the barber in 11 days. (Once full immunity kicks in.)
