L, Another Saturday Night - The Letter “K”, WYgalinCaliforThe Village, 2021-05-01, Good evening everybody and welcome to another Saturday night of music memories and conversations.  Last week we shared some of our personal playlists and/or songs that kept us going these last 12+ months.  Tonight we’re going back to our ABC’s and the letter “K”. I found multiple songs (although not too many singers/groups) that start with this letter.  I’m choosing to use a favorite of mine by Roberta Flack.   . You know how this works — Put your quarter in the slot and your song in the comments.  This is your Saturday night jukebox and the party starts NOW.
