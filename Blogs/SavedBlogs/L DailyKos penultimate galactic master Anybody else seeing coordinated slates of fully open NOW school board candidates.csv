L, Anybody else seeing coordinated slates of "fully open NOW" school board candidates?, penultimate galactic master, 2021-04-29, A while back some GOP strategist or pollster somewhere commented that “open the schools NOW!!!” would be the silver-bullet that would win the suburbs for the GOP.  I laughed it off at the time… after all we’ll probably get enough people vaccinated by fall 2021 that the schools will be open and their movement will fizzle before it gets started.   And I still think  it will be non-issue before the fall elections and certainly before the midterms.  But Tim Scott brought it up in his speech last night and there are other elections going on right now…  Lo and behold I cracked open my Washington County Oregon voters guide for the schoolboard elections and it seems like every challenger candidate running for the school board is running on a “five full days in person NOW” platform…. with  community endorsements from GOP-leaning “taxpayer associations” local GOP politicians and church pastors.  I’m concerned that these slates will harness pandemic fatigue and coupled with “liberals don’t go door to door during pandemics” and the fact these are very low turnout elections  we’ll end up with a slew of reactionaries on the school boards pushing trans-bans hunting for “critical race theory” in the social studies curriculum and fighting with the teachers unions.    Is this just in my neck of the woods or are other folks seeing this?
