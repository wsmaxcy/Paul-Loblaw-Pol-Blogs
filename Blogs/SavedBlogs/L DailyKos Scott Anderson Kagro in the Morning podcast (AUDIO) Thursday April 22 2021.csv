Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is Earth Day! David Waldman eco-celebrates in KITM Earth Headquarters. Meanwhile Eco-rebels misutilize poo outside the White House perhaps in an effort to get their hands on pink wheelbarrows.  Elsewhere on Earth Greg Dworkin brings us the latest in polling and pandemics. Are vaccine rejectors like motorcyclists that refuse to wear a helmet? If so why do they keep crashing into our restaurants? Germany was way ahead of us on containing Covid-19 and are now leading on losing control. India is in worse shape with the pandemic than ever. In fact they are the worst in the world. The Gop just can’t villainize Joe Biden.  Donald Trump was a villain but his polls were steady Joe’s polls might be the same. Liz Cheney also a villain is probably the most indestructible of the bunch. Trump made a special effort to screw Puerto Rico after their hurricane. The Postal Service is revealed to be running a “covert operations program” that monitors Americans' social media posts... as the Founders intended apparently. The Gop doesn’t want to hear that the 2017 shooting of congressional baseball players might not be terrorism they need that for “whatabouts”. Capitol Police officers on the other hand were told anti-Trump protesters were the only ones to worry about. Nancy Pelosi keeps handing concessions to Republicans to get them for a January 6 commission. Concessions won’t work and Nancy knows it. To save time Democrats are rejecting the Republican’s phony infrastructure bid before it is even placed. Bystanders and their cameras convicted Derek Chauvin. Derek Chauvin's conviction will almost certainly stand. The guy who was Alan Dershowitz will stand for anything.
