L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Rayla Campbell, republicinsanity, 2021-04-26, Welcome to what is the 980th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Rayla Campbell a 2020 Republican candidate for U.S. House of Representatives in Massachussetts’ 7th Congressional District aspiring to get stomped on Election Day by the incredibly popular Democratic Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. Campbell unsuccessfully sued to try and get on the ballot (she only got 1200 votes in the primary and needed 2000 signatures to get on ballot in the general election) and ended up being a write-in candidate who only got 695 votes or 0.2% of those cast in the district.However we’re giving a quick profile to Rayla Campbell for her support of Qanon as her campaign page was chock full of photos of her wearing a Qanon t-shirt with the “WWG1WGA” slogan making her the latest Republican running for Congress who bought into the deranged conspiracy theory. Including with some proud anti-vaxxers protesting the flu shot.That might be a good thing to remember because Rayla Campbell has designs on elected office again in 2022 already working towards being elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. Hopefully that will not come to pass and she does not become a perennial candidate trying her luck at winning office.       One Year Ago April 26th 2020: George Papadopoulos (CA)Two Years Ago April 26th 2019: Bill Dix (IA)Three Years Ago April 26th 2018: Bill Lant (MO)Four Years Ago April 26th 2017: Tim Jones (MO)Five Years Ago.
