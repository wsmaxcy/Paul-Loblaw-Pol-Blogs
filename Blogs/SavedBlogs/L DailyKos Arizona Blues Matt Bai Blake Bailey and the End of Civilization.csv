L, Matt Bai Blake Bailey and the End of Civilization, Arizona Blues, 2021-04-29, Anybody else notice that since the inauguration The Washington Post has been devoting a large proportion of its editorial real estate to pro-Republican viewpoints? That wouldn’t bother me if “Republican” still meant “conservative” but nowadays it just means anti-Democrat... Anyway today’s column by Matt Bai made me want to respond. Bai sees W.W. Norton’s decision to drop publication of the new Philip Roth biography because of multiple accusations of sexual assault against its author Blake Bailey as a slippery slope to Soviet gulags. What Norton is doing he claims is the equivalent of imploding the Guggenheim in New York because Frank Lloyd Wright was an “unseemly” human being. The thing that caught my eye was his claim that this is a “largely generational debate” regarding free expression in society with The Olds having grown up with the existential threat of the Cold War and therefore appreciate the value of free expression and the youngsters having suckled at the bosom of college campuses where they learned that “free expression most often benefits the powerful and that some people and ideas are simply antithetical to an enlightened society and must be quashed.” I’ll agree with him that there is something generational going on here but it doesn’t have to do with attitudes towards free expression; it has to do with attitudes towards powerful white men getting away with treating other people — often women and minorities — like garbage. What the youth are learning in college is that the powerful white men who were lionized despite their “unseemly” behavior got away with it because of racism sexism and capitalism and that if they want that to end they need to speak up about it. That makes the powerful white men sad and they express this sadness by linking their loss of privilege with the end of civilization. This is a load of BS. The end of white male privilege is a step on the road to a more civilized society where people have to treat others with respect and humanity or face consequences. We can’t do anything about how Frank Lloyd Wright or Picasso treated women in the past but that doesn’t mean we have to continue tolerating this behavior from the Blake Bailey’s of the world.
