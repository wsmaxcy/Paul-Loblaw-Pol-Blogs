L, A New Multi-national Corporate Charter to "bring corporations to heel" and stick it to the Supremes, avelox400, 2021-04-29, By law congress can authorize and require any corporation that wants to trade with buying or selling any goods or services other countries have a new Transnational For-Profit Corporation Charter. They would be considered both foreign and domestic corporations as would any partially or wholly-owned subsidiary. All officers and directors and any other business in which they or their families have a financial interest would also be considered foreign.    Because those corporations would by definition be foreign they could be banned from contributing funds or speech for any political purpose (including lobbying). In addition under a federal corporate charter the government can state what rights the corporation would have and they would not include political speech as necessary for their business purpose. If it were me I’d also ban a number of other corporate practices such as arbitration agreement requirements in employee or consumer contracts. This would essentially end the bribery of our public officials so I have to acknowledge it will never pass Congress. I just came up with this brainstorm so it won’t surprise me if there is a fatal flaw of some sort.
