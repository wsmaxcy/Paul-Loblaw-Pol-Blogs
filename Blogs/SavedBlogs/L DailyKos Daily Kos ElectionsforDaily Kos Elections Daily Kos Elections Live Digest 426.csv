Ralph Northam ahead of the June 8 Democratic primary. Ayala whose 2017 win made her one of the first Latinas to serve in the state House would be the first woman of color elected statewide in Virginia. She faces five rivals for the nomination including three with significantly more cash-on-hand than her.  New York City NY Mayor: Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams unveiled an endorsement Monday from Ruben Diaz Jr. his counterpart in the Bronx for the June instant-runoff Democratic primary. Diaz who is one of the more prominent Latinos in city politics surprised almost all political observers last year when he decided not to wage his own campaign for mayor. AZ-Sen: Thiel Capital chief operating officer Blake Masters hasn’t even publicly expressed interest in a Senate bid yet but Politico reports that hasn’t stopped his boss Republican mega donor Peter Thiel from dumping $10 million into a super PAC former to support him. Thiel recently made a similar investment on behalf of venture capitalist J.D. Vance a likely GOP Senate candidate in Ohio.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell meanwhile has reportedly been attempting to convince Gov. Doug Ducey to change his mind and run against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after all but Donald Trump is certainly not making McConnell’s job any easier. The Daily Beast writes that Trump who remains furious with the governor for not going along with his attempt to steal Arizona’s electoral votes has “told associates he would gladly and personally spoil any of Ducey’s future political plans.”  Trump even reportedly ranted that he’d go and campaign for Kelly if Ducey won the GOP nomination a threat that while few believe Trump would actually follow through on shows just how much he despises his one-time ally. We may never find out just how far Trump would go though as the conservative Washington Examiner said last week that Ducey “continues to wave off the encouragement from fellow Republicans” to run. GA-Sen GA-Gov: Former Republican Rep. Doug Collins said Monday that he wouldn’t run for anything in 2022. Collins who gave up his seat in the House last year to unsuccessfully run for the Senate had previously talked about campaigning against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock or waging a primary bid against Gov. Brian Kemp.  FL-Gov: Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist recently created a political committee that allows him to raise money for a potential bid for governor. NV-Gov: North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee didn’t rule out a run for governor earlier this month just before he left the Democratic Party to join the Republicans and political columnist Jim Hartman writes that he’s indeed considering taking on Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak. Hartman also adds that 2018 nominee Adam Laxalt has turned his attention to a possible campaign against Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and doesn’t appear interested in another campaign against Sisolak. LA-02: The all-Democratic special election runoff for Louisiana's vacant 2nd Congressional District saw state Sen. Troy Carter defeat fellow state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson 55-45 on Saturday. Carter will succeed Cedric Richmond who resigned from this New Orleans-area district in January to take a post in the Biden White House. Many national observers saw the contest between Carter and Peterson (who are not related) as a battle between moderates and progressives. Both New Orleans-based legislators campaigned as ardent Democrats but Peterson who would have been the first Black woman to represent Louisiana in Congress argued she was the more liberal of the two. Notably while Peterson emphatically backed the Green New Deal Carter would only call it "a good blueprint" and said he didn't support the plan. Carter in turn insisted he’d have an easier time working with Republicans in Congress than Peterson. Carter did in fact earn the support of some prominent Republicans including Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng but he also had endorsements from Richmond himself and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn the highest-ranking Black member of the House. Peterson for her part enjoyed the backing of Gary Chambers a vocal progressive who took a strong third place in the first round of voting in March as well as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and she also benefited from $1.2 million in runoff spending from EMILY’s List. However other factors at work complicate the narrative that Carter's victory was a win for the establishment over progressive outsiders. To begin with both Carter and Peterson have served in elected office since the 1990s and Peterson even chaired the state Democratic Party from 2012 until just last year.  In a marker of their political longevity both candidates also competed against one another for a previous version of this seat 15 years ago. Carter took a distant fifth in the all-party primary while Peterson went on to lose a runoff to then-Rep. Bill Jefferson; Carter would unsuccessfully run again two years later. Stephanie Grace of the New Orleans Advocate also notes that Carter also had the support of very influential liberal politicians in New Orleans an area that made up just over half the vote in Saturday's election. Among those in Carter's corner were Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams a progressive reformer who won his seat last year by beating a Peterson-backed opponent as well as City Council President Helena Moreno. And while both candidates supported LGBTQ rights Grace notes that Carter’s “longtime advocacy made him the favorite for much of that community.” Local New Orleans political divides also likely played a big role in the end result. Peterson is a leader in the Black Organization for Leadership Development (BOLD) a longtime power-player in the Crescent City that has often clashed with Richmond and his allies. Both sides ran up some major wins and losses in the 2019 legislative elections and if anything Saturday's runoff was a continuation of that long-running battle—one in which the Richmond-Carter bloc came out decisively on top.  Peterson had needed a good showing in Orleans Parish which is coterminous with the city of New Orleans to make up for her losses in the rest of the district but Carter instead carried it 53-47. SC-Gov SC-01: Former Rep. Joe Cunningham announced Monday that he would seek the Democratic nomination to take on Republican Gov. Henry McMaster rather than try and regain his old House seat along the South Carolina coast. Cunningham lost his bid for a second term by a narrow 51-49 to Republican Nancy Mace last year as Donald Trump was taking the 1st District 52-46 and he’ll face a decidedly uphill climb in a state that Trump won by a much-larger 55-43 spread. Still Democrats are hoping that two uninterrupted decades of GOP governors as well as a potentially competitive Republican primary could give them an opening to score their first statewide win since 2006. Cunningham is McMaster’s only notable opponent from either party so far but a few Republicans have shown some interest in taking on the governor. The most vocal member of this group is businessman John Warren who lost the 2018 runoff to McMaster 54-46 and didn’t rule out a rematch back in January. Reapportionment: On Monday the Census Bureau released long-awaited data from the 2020 census showing which states will gain seats in the House for the coming decade and which will see their congressional delegations shrink. In all 13 states will feel the impact of population changes over the past 10 years with six adding seats and seven losing representatives. These shifts are all reflected in this map but they contain some unexpected surprises compared to projections based on recent growth trends. In a continuation of long-standing patterns most of the increases in representation will be concentrated in Sun Belt states with Texas once again leading the way in gaining two seats. However while Florida looked likely to grow by two seats it will only add one and Arizona which forecasts showed tacking on another seat won’t pick up any. Conversely losses will largely show up in states in the Midwest and Northeast though New York avoided shedding two seats and came just 89 people away from standing pat. California meanwhile will experience its first decline in seats in state history. Montana which lost a seat after the 1990 census will once more send two members to Washington D.C. though Rhode Island which appeared to be on track to end up with just a single at-large district will hang on to both of its seats. These shifts also affect the number of votes each state gets in the Electoral College though they would not have altered the outcome of last year’s presidential election and instead would have narrowed Joe Biden’s 306-232 win slightly to 303-235. But the biggest impacts of the census won’t be known until congressional redistricting is complete a process that thanks to delays in the production of necessary data won’t begin until August at the earliest and will likely last through a good part of next year. We do know however that Republicans will once again dominate the redistricting process just as they did following the 2010 census: As shown on this map GOP lawmakers in the states will be able to draw new maps for anywhere from 38% to 46% of all districts while Democrats will control the process for just 16% of seats (the remainder will likely be drawn by nonpartisan entities or through bipartisan compromise).

Tim Ryan has launched a campaign for Ohio’s open U.S. Senate seat. Ryan who is close to labor and had $1 million in the bank at the end of March is the first major candidate to announce a bid for Team Blue and he’ll likely be the frontrunner in a primary. He’d face a tough general election battle though in a former swing state that supported Donald Trump by a wide 53-45 margin last year.  Still the congressman and his allies are hoping that Ryan who has represented the Youngstown area in Congress since 2003 will be able to win back the type of working class voters who backed the Democratic ticket until the Trump era. He very much seemed to be aiming his opening message at this demographic declaring “Ohioans are working harder than ever they’re doing everything right and they’re still falling behind.” Ryan himself has also managed to decisively hold the 13th Congressional District which backed Barack Obama 63-35 in 2012 but only supported Joe Biden 51-48 despite its ugly trend to the right. Still his 52-45 showing last cycle was by far the narrowest victory in his 10 House campaigns. Ryan has until now explored running for statewide office numerous times only to stay in the House but his congressional district may not exist for much longer. Ryan made his announcement hours before the Census confirmed that Ohio would be losing a seat. Ohio Republicans also will more or less have free rein to draw the new congressional maps as they please despite the passage in 2018 of a supposedly reform-minded constitutional amendment and they very well could leave Ryan’s would-be Democratic successors without a friendly constituency to campaign for. PA-Sen PA-Gov: The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jonathan Tamari relays that Republican Rep. Mike Kelly or his team have told at least two of his colleagues that he’ll seek re-election rather than run for Senate or for governor. VA-Gov: The Virginia Republican Party will be choosing its statewide nominees at its May 8 convention but the Washington Post’s Laura Vozzella says it will likely take "several days" to learn the winners. The party’s State Central Committee voted Sunday to begin a hand-count of the ballots starting the day after the gathering a lengthy process that involves instant-runoff tabulations; Vozzella adds “Votes will be weighted based on each locality’s performance in past GOP contests.”  NJ-11: The New Jersey Globe mentions former Monmouth County Freeholder Christine Myers as a possible Republican opponent for Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill though there’s no word on her interest. Myers’ name came up here in 2018 and 2020 but she opted to remain at the Small Business Administration during both cycles. Myers though was one of the many Trump appointees who recently lost their post in the federal government. OH-01: Franklin Mayor Brent Centers recently filed paperwork with the FEC but the Republican isn’t ready to launch a bid for Congress yet. Centers recently told the National Journal’s Kirk Bado that he wasn’t making any decisions until he sees Ohio’s new congressional map though he added that he wanted to run for the seat in the Cincinnati suburbs. The mayor also said of Republican Rep. Steve Chabot who appears to be his most likely opponent “After 25 years we need new energy. I would hope he retires.” Chabot however has insisted time after time that he’s not going anywhere.  OH-15: Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday announced the dates of the special election to succeed Rep. Steve Stivers a fellow Republican who will resign May 16 in order to lead the state Chamber of Commerce. The filing deadline will be the following day May 17. The primary and general will be Aug. 3 and Nov. 2 respectively the same as the dates for the special for the 11th District. TX-06: Republican activist Susan Wright picked up an endorsement Monday from Donald Trump less than a week ahead of the May 1 all-party primary to succeed her late husband Rep. Ron Wright.  Trump made his not-tweet days after his camp publicly called out former wrestler Dan Rodimer for claiming “Our campaign is the only one that has ever been endorsed by President Trump in this race.” Trump did indeed back Rodimer last year when he was the GOP nominee for Congress―in Nevada. CA-AG: Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert on Monday announced a campaign against Democratic incumbent Rob Bonta who was confirmed to this post just last week. Schubert a former Republican who became an independent in 2018 attracted national attention for her role in apprehending the Golden State Killer in 2016 and she would be the first gay person elected to this post. Schubert presented herself as a counter to two prominent California criminal justice reformers who recently won district attorney races Los Angeles County’s George Gascón and San Francisco's Chesa Boudin. She joins a top-two primary that includes Republican Nathan Hochman a former federal prosecutor who is running on similar themes.   Special Elections: There was a special election on Saturday in Louisiana and there is also one on tap for Tuesday in Connecticut. First up is our recap: LA-HD-82: Republican Laurie Schlegel defeated fellow party member Eddie Connick 52-48 in a runoff election to win this suburban New Orleans district. Schlegel was able to reverse her fortunates from the first round of voting which Connick led 40-36.  This chamber is now at full strength with Republicans in control 68-35 (there are two independent members).  CT-HD-145: This is a Democratic district in Stamford that became vacant when former Rep. Patricia Miller was elected to the state Senate in a special election in March. Democrat Corey Paris is taking on Republican J.D. Ospina and both candidates have run for office before; Paris waged a bid for a state House seat in the Bridgeport area in 2018 but failed to make the ballot while Ospina ran for this seat in 2020 losing to Miller 77-23.   This is a strongly Democratic district that backed Hillary Clinton 80-17 in 2016. Democrats currently control this chamber 96-54 with just this seat vacant.  NY-24: The Conservative Party in Onondaga County which makes up most of New York's 24th Congressional District says it won't endorse Republican Rep. John Katko next year putting the congressman at risk of losing a ballot line that's played a key role in sustaining his political career. Katko had previously lost the support of Conservatives in the other three counties in the district—Oswego Cayuga and Wayne—though the ultimate decision will fall to state party chair Jerry Kassar who previously said Katko is "in trouble" and reportedly plans to defer to local leaders. Katko has received a great deal of attention—and from Donald Trump loyalists scorn—for his vote to impeach Trump in January but that's not the only issue putting him at odds with the Conservative Party. Die-hards are also pissed that he backed the Equality Act which would protect LGBTQ rights and that voted to boot Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments due to her violent rhetoric. However Katko also voted for the Equality Act in 2019 and still retained the Conservative Party's support the next year so there may be time to repair the relationship. Katko will certainly hope so: In 2018 he defeated Democrat Dana Balter by 13694 votes—fewer than the 16972 he received on the Conservative line. While his victory wasn't dependent on that line in his 2020 rematch with Balter Katko might not be so lucky next year especially if Democrats target him in redistricting. Onondoga Conservatives say they'll ask Kassar to either leave the party's line blank or endorse someone else in 2022. The latter option could prove particularly self-defeating but it's a tack not unfamiliar to right-wing extremists in New York: Republicans lost a special election in 2009 in what was then the 23rd Congressional District after the GOP and the Conservative Party nominated different candidates allowing Democrat Bill Owens to flip a seat that had been red since the 19th century.
