L, Good News Roundup for Friday July 2 2021: Take a Moment to Celebrate, chloris creatorforGood News, 2021-07-02, Instead of opening with my own words today I’m going to quote from a column by Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post President Biden promised during the 2020 campaign to lower the national blood pressure and return the country to some sense of normalcy. No rage and/or middle-of-the-night tweets. Weekends without news. Decorum from the leader of the free world. Cordial relations with the media. A return to actual policymaking. We so quickly adapt to the newest normal that we soon forget how thoroughly unproductive (aside from tax cuts for the rich) and incompetent was the prior administration. It was not unreasonable to panic for four years that no one — or someone deranged — was captaining the ship of state. But six months into the new administration the political culture and media seem not to have accepted a federal government that lacks the sort of hysteria controversy and scandal that defined the previous presidency. The tendency to overwrought drama (The infrastructure deal is in peril!) and the constant expectation of doom (The deal is on track but danger ahead!) suggest not only a desperation to attract eyeballs and clicks but also a cynicism that things cannot really have improved all that much. But they have. Rubin then goes on to describe all the great progress that has been made with respect to the pandemic judges the economy and more. And we know Biden is at least tackling thorny issues: climate change voting rights even gun safety. I know it’s hard to relax and I don’t think we should in the long term. We still have monumental challenges with the large set of RWNJs with the assault on voting OKd by the Supremes with a heat wave that burned a Canadian village to the ground. But maybe just maybe relax a little now and then? Whether you can do that or not take time to fortify yourselves with good news as we prepare to celebrate another Independence Day. Because you know last year at this time we could not know if we would get another Independence Day. But yesterday was Indictment Day (we hope the first of many) and Sunday is Independence Day. So have a good time with your vaccinated friends. Regular Scheduled Programming No one here is naïve; we are aware of the many who are fighting to destroy our country. Some of us expected it: the cheating the lying the chaos and yes even the attempts to cling to power despite the clear will of the people. But we are here to read the efforts and the positive results of those (including us and our fellow gnus) who are working so hard to save our country from those very bad people.  We are furious with them for what they are doing and we are letting them know.  Remember: 💚  There are more of us than there are of them. 💛 They are terrified when we organize.  THERE IS LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE TERRIFIED! 💔 They want us to be demoralized. We have to keep demoralizing them. Name blame and shame!  IT IS WORKING! WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE DEMORALIZED! 💙 The best way to keep up your spirits is to fight. So take the time to recharge your batteries but find ways to contribute to the well-being of our country and our world. Biden Harris and their administration have been hard at work. Here are the last week’s posts at the White House briefing room. Total vaccinations in arms as of July 1 9 am: 328152304 🎩 hpg.  Take that McConnell! President Biden is on the fastest pace for judicial confirmations in a first presidential term in more than 50 years. https://t.co/TJjx4lSSph Federal executions halted as DOJ reviews tRump-era policies Devlin Barrett and Amy B Wang Washington Post Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday issued a moratorium on federal executions ordering a review of death penalty policy changes made during the Trump administration. The move is an abrupt shift for the department which just weeks ago filed court papers seeking to reinstate the death penalty against Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Most arrests made public in a single day for the Capitol riot Spencer S Hsu and Rachel Weiner Washington Post More than a dozen arrests in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot were announced or unsealed Wednesday revealing charges against alleged supporters of extremist right-wing groups including the Oath Keepers Proud Boys and “boogaloo boys” movement and individuals accused of attacking the property of news media. Negotiating with Rs has been as I heard on some podcast not a process of negotiating with hostage takers — but of negotiating with the hostages themselves. That is why it is so difficult — hostages cannot negotiate. Lately we have seen a few tentative steps towards the light. Mike Pence has said he supports the Constitution and he’s proud of what he did on Jan 6 (and probably he should be). Bill Barr said tRump lost fair and square. Even Alabama refused to let tRump come! And even DeSantis asked tRump not to do a rally in Florida! Still the Rs keep backsliding and most remain in their hostage situation. Here are a few paragraphs from Karen Tumulty at the Washington Post The telltale characteristics of an abuser are well known: volatility extreme jealousy cruelty controlling behavior. So when are Republican leaders going to quit rationalizing and acknowledge the truth about their toxic relationship with Donald Trump? But the fragility of that premise becomes more apparent every day as Trump increasingly turns his wrath on them undermining their legitimacy and questioning their fitness to govern. And then there’s this: 'I'm honored': Liz Cheney throws Jan. 6 committee assignment in Kevin McCarthy's face  https://t.co/3O6EZLZCju And this… Kevin McCarthy threatens Republicans if they serve on the House Select #January6Commission. @RepKinzinger responds "who gives a s****?"I could not have said it better. https://t.co/DWOd8ZlpUu  Conservative apps no longer gaining so many new members Sara Fischer Axios The massive migration by the fringe-right to new social networks has largely died down according to new data from Sensor Tower. By the numbers: Almost every major conservative social network has seen a dramatic decrease in downloads since the Capitol insurrection. Rumble a conservative answer to YouTube receives far more monthly app downloads than its peers although it's still in decline. I am thrilled simply thrilled about the Select Committee formed by Pelosi. News from Pelosi: House Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson will serve as the chair of the Jan. 6 select committee.Other committee members: Reps. Schiff Raskin Lofgren Luira Murphy Aguilar. The Republican is Rep. Liz Cheney. And it is already in progress: New: Jan. 6 House select committee chair Bennie Thompson says their investigation into the Capitol attack started “thirty minutes ago” — saying he expects public hearings and could depose Trump McCarthy. And a protection against further tRump wannabes: The House passed a comprehensive package of reforms to protect inspectors general from being fired or otherwise prevented from doing their jobs a measure inspired by Trump's pattern of ousting agency watchdogs who challenged him.https://t.co/bHjVeALj2C  130 countries sign on to global minimum tax plan David Lynch Washington Post The Biden administration claimed an important victory on Thursday in its drive for a global minimum corporate tax with an announcement from Paris that 130 countries had signed on to the plan. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) made the announcement which includes an agreement on taxing the American giants of the Internet economy such as Google Facebook and Amazon. 💜 Biden and DeSantis together at Surfside tragedy Quint Forgey Politico Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday praised President Joe Biden’s federal response to the collapse of a condo building in the coastal suburb of Surfside — providing a moment of bipartisan bonhomie between the leader of the Democratic Party and a rising star within Donald Trump’s GOP. Speaking at a command briefing near the site of the deadly disaster DeSantis — seated beside Biden — said the president had “recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one and you’ve been very supportive.” 💜 DeSantis (again !!!) signs Florida environmental law. Craig Pittman Florida Phoenix  But to my surprise the legislators did one good thing: They passed a bill called the “Florida Wildlife Corridor Act” which does exactly what Ward and Guthrie had in mind. And it was not the least bit controversial. The votes were unanimous in both the House and the Senate. This is a miracle akin to the Devil showing up in church on Easter Sunday apologizing to everyone for causing so much trouble and dropping a $1000 bill in the offering plate. The Florida Wildlife Corridors Act “is considered a milestone in efforts to preserve migration paths for animals such as the Florida panther keeping them from becoming isolated and inbred” WUSF-FM reported. “Once you understand the necessity of the corridor it makes good sense” the bill’s original sponsor Republican Rep. Keith Truenow a sod farmer from Tavares told me this week. When he said that I nearly fell out of my chair. Of course Florida wants to keep its wildlife because that’s a big attraction.  Voting rights. This may be the biggest issue threatening our democracy right now. Besides contacting your representatives at the state and federal level to do the right thing (depending on who they are) you can support and contact these organizations: ACLU — American Civil Liberties Union Democracy Docket — founded by Marc Elias so important in fighting the challenges after the last election. Fair Fight — founded by Stacey Abrams 🌱Grass roots. Biden and Harris can do the top-down stuff but we have to support from the bottom. I don’t know how to deprogram 75 million people but some things have been written about such as deep canvassing and lots of people are talking about this. If you know someone (who did not storm the Capitol) then see if you can be pleasant. Instead of trying to reason with them (logic is obviously not their strong point) distract them with something else. We need to remove the sources of lies and to take down the temperature. If we get more of the Rs to wear masks and to get vaccinated and to vote for Ds the country will be a better place. We need to coax some of them out of the rabbit holes and diffuse the anger and the crazy. 🏃 Run for something. If you want to run for something but have no idea what to do these people will help you. They also like money and volunteers to help those people who are running so even if you’re not in a position to stand for office you can help. Note: they are especially planning to target the 57 Rs in local governments who participated in the insurrection.  👎 Defund the seditionists. This is a list with companies that sometimes have donated to the seditionists and their current approach to supporting or not supporting the seditionists. The list is long. You will recognize many of the corporations and you probably have a relationship with some — either you are a customer a shareholder or maybe even an employee. Contact them and compliment or complain but let them know you are watching. Forward it to others. AND DON’T USE TOYOTA. Heh heh. There’s so much more in-depth reporting everywhere else so I’m not going to try to do this justice but you do get to enjoy some tweets: Trump CFO Allen H. Weisselberg surrendering to authorities this morning.Donald is not going to be pleased. And not just because Allen didn't wear a tie. pic.twitter.com/GwyECujkUX and this: ...in fact if even the smallest bit of this case is true I think the Trump Org could be dead. It's complicated but it primarily pertains to the 12th count of the indictment.Taking this a step at a time: Like most real estate companies the Trump Org is horribly illiquid...2 and this… Exactly what I have heard from very wise & connected people in the last few weeks.I think people are really really underestimating how big and bad this is going to get for the Trump Crime Family & inner circle in the rest of 2021. If Hunter says this take it very seriously. https://t.co/VJndlG0Jr3  The Giulianis provide so much Schadenfreude! Remember Andrew Giuliani is running for governor in NYS — but the GOP gave him 0% support in this poll: NEWS: NY GOP straw votes results are in:Congressman Lee Zeldin received 85% of the weighted vote from GOP county chairs county chairs- which means @leezeldinis the favored gubernatorial candidate in 2022. Former Westchester County Executive @RobAstorino:5% Abstain: 10% And there’s this: “Donald Trump please pay for my legal fees” says one of the latest January 6 defendants after leaving the courthouse. “This all happened because of you.”The defendant Zvonimir Jurlina claims in a YouTube stream that he’s a “political prisoner” and a “real American patriot.” pic.twitter.com/jtCyVpUDLw I think tRump is worried about his own legal fees suckah! Until the DOJ and/or the House make more progress on the investigation of January 6 the work on getting the news about this out to the public falls to the press. Kudos to the New York Times this week for putting together an important video (I can’t get it to embed) — accompanied by critical analysis giving us a better idea of the big picture. Here is some of what they found: Evidence collected by the F.B.I. suggests that the Proud Boys in particular were aware that they had inflamed the mob of ordinary people — and may have intended to do so in advance. Just before the assault one Proud Boy leader wrote on a group chat on Telegram that he was hoping his men could incite the “normies” to “burn that city to ash today” and “smash some pigs to dust.” Then after the riot another Proud Boy leader wrote on Telegram: “This is NOT what I expected to happen. All from us showing up and starting some chants and getting the normies all riled up.” ✂️ As Mr. Trump spoke near the White House supporters who had already gathered at the Capitol building hoping to disrupt the certification responded. Hearing his message to “walk down to the Capitol” they interpreted it as the president sending reinforcements. “There’s about a million people on their way now” we heard a man in the crowd say as Mr. Trump’s speech played from a loudspeaker. ✂️ One unanswered question when we began this investigation was how the police managed to reclaim the Capitol building from the mob. We found that once officers increased their numbers armor and crowd-control weapons clearing the rioters happened quickly and effectively. The footage revealed that officers cleared several locations in less than an hour after being reinforced by local Metropolitan Police Virginia State Police and other local and federal agencies that arrived with more manpower and authorization to use more powerful crowd-control weapons. Perhaps truth stands a chance? tRump and his scandals were good for media. Heck they were even “good” for the readership of the GNRs which has been a little less active since his departure (on my GNRs around the election and the Friday after Jan 6 each diary garnered more than 400 comments).  This is a good thing. Ratings are not everything and some of us have other lives. But what is even more interesting is that the far right and the right-leaning outlets have lost much more than the far left and the left-leaning news outlets. This trend probably has several causes. Some of the far right is discouraged. After tRump was elected back in 2016 I could not face the news for months. Maybe some are too depressed to watch. The deplatforming of tRump probably helped. I expect some people also got tired of the constant cognitive dissonance (i.e. being lied to). There’s also the fact that Biden is just so hard to attack that nothing is sticking to him! Anyway the reduction in the influence of the far right relative to the left is a wonderful thing for truth. Sorry not sorry.https://t.co/pmfxZLhGaz ️ The first award goes to the first responders who have been working so hard in Surfside Florida. Wink News Florida Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 6 is based in Southwest Florida and are among the first responders who went to Surfside to assist in the search and rescue mission. Andrew Schmidt is with Task Force 6 feels a responsibility to the families of those who are unaccounted for to those who are hoping and praying for miracles. But he knows this grim work is tough on his teammates. “They get to a scene and what they want to do is they want to help as quickly as possible” Schmidt said. Task Force Six is working 12-hour shifts. This is day six and 11 people are dead 150 are still unaccounted for. K️idney exchange to each other’s husbands Cathy Free Washington Post  Tia Wimbush and Susan Ellis have been co-workers for a decade and while they didn’t know each other well they learned two years ago that their spouses each needed a kidney transplant. ✂️  The women saw each other in a restroom at work and started chatting as they washed their hands. They had a lot in common both working in information technology at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and dealing with the same medical stress at home. ✂️  Wimbush casually asked Ellis what her husband’s blood type was. ✂️  The women paused for a moment and looked at each other. Then Wimbush realized they might have stumbled upon something that might help save both of their husbands’ lives. 70-year-old bat girl Gwen Goldman Neelam Bohra and Radhika Marya CNN When 10-year-old Gwen Goldman wrote a letter to the New York Yankees in 1961 about her dream to be a bat girl general manager Roy Hamey told her a young lady such as herself would "feel out of place in a dugout." Sixty years later Goldman got to prove him wrong. Earlier this year Goldman's daughter Abby McLoughlin reached out to the Yankees about Hamey's letter — which Goldman has displayed on her living room wall. Here are some pictures In 1961 Gwen Goldman wanted to be a bat girl. The Yankees told her no.Today 60 years later her dream comes true. pic.twitter.com/hKergQuXvg Oh and another dream denied for decades to come true at last Sara Betancourt The Guardian Wally Funk a trailblazing female pilot denied the job of astronaut in the 1960s over her gender will finally get the chance to fulfill her dreams of going into space. Billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced Thursday on Instagram that Funk will be part of a four-person crew set to be launched into space by Blue Origin during a 10-minute flight on his rocket New Shepard later this month. Funk 82 will be the oldest person ever to travel into space after the late John Glenn set the current record at age 77 while aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998.  ☕️ Inga alley cropping Andy Corbley Good News Network  There’s a ‘wonder tree’ in Honduras that’s acting as a game-changer—creating organic farming livelihoods climate resistance and hope to farmers in the Central American nation and elsewhere. Because of this tree the oft-used method of tropical land clearance—which tragically tends to yield one good crop without another one ever following—is being replaced with another form of agroforestry that ticks every box and which has rural farmers running towards regenerative farming methods. This form is called Inga alley cropping. It has been pioneered by a British surveyor in Honduras named Dr. Mike Hands and the method is built around one special tree class called Inga. This member of the legume family contains over 300 varieties and its endemic characteristics gave Hands the basis of his revolutionary form of agroforestry. The Inga can reforest areas that have been cleared.

But when it comes to hauling heavy loads most of the world's trucks still run on diesel. But that's starting to change with the introduction in Germany of the world's first 16 tonne (approximately 17.6 U.S ton) all-electric truck. The Volta Zero has already been demonstrated in France Italy and Spain. It's due to enter service by the end of this year.  🐦 I do a lot of other writing.
