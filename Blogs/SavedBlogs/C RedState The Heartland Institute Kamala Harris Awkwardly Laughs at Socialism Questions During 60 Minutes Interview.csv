C, Kamala Harris Awkwardly Laughs at Socialism Questions During 60 Minutes Interview, The Heartland Institute, 2020-10-26, On October 25 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Norah O’Donnell of CBS’ 60 Minutes. During the interview O’Donnell lobbed several softball questions however she did broach one topic with a few hard-hitting inquires. That topic was socialism as it relates to a potential Biden administration. “The president made the case at the Republican Convention that your administration would be a Trojan horse for liberals. That AOC Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren would actually be controlling policy that this would become the most liberal administration in U.S. history” O’Donnell said. Biden responded “He’d love to run against them wouldn’t he? Mr. President you’re running against Joe Biden. Joe Biden has a deep steep and successful record over a long long time.” What Biden neglected to state is that he is in lock-step policy-wise with many of the liberals O’Donnell mentioned. For instance the former vice president has signed onto the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations which is on his website. The 110-page document which includes “free college” a $15 federal minimum wage and several other liberal/socialist policies would serve as the basic platform for a Biden administration. And despite Biden’s insistence that he is not a Left-wing radical the platform was drafted by many self-avowed socialists such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who is the co-chair of the “Combating the Climate Crisis and Pursuing Environmental Justice” section. Then O’Donnell addressed Harris’ rather radical record. “You’re very different in the policies that you’ve supported in the past. You’re considered the most liberal United States senator.” Harris responded with a typical non-answer “I somebody said that and it actually was Mike Pence on the debate stage.” She proceeded to burst out laughing for some reason. To her credit O’Donnell set the record straight likely to Harris’ dismay. “Yeah. Well actually the nonpartisan GovTrack has rated you as the most liberal senator. You supported the Green New Deal you supported Medicare for All. You’ve supported legalizing marijuana. Joe Biden doesn’t support those things. So are you gonna bring the policies those progressive policies that you supported as senator into a Biden administration?” Harris delivered another non-sequitur. “What I will do and I promise you this and this is what Joe wants me to do this was part of our deal I will always share with him my lived experience as it relates to any issue that we confront. And I promised Joe that I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him.” Again Harris failed to address O’Donnell’s straight-forward question as she laughed nervously. However O’Donnell did not give up. She asked Harris an even more simple question “And is that a socialist or progressive perspective?” Harris again laughing like a school girl muttered “No. No. It is the perspective of a woman who grew up a Black child in America who was also a prosecutor who also has a mother who arrived here at the age of 19 from India. Who also you know l like hip hop. Like what do you wanna know?” The back-and-forth went on a little while longer with Harris continually laughing and avoiding the question being asked. O’Donnell like many Americans is wondering what a Biden administration would actually do. To date Biden has punted on whether or not he would pack the Supreme Court among many other important issues. Americans with less than a week before a monumental election are seeking clarity on what a Biden administration would do in terms of policy. But like they’ve been doing for months Biden and his running mate simply refused to give clear answers. Even more portentously when confronted with a few simple questions about socialistic policies that she has unabashedly supported in the past Harris nervously laughed repeatedly instead of answering whether or not she would promote them as vice-president. People laugh in serious situations for many reasons be it anxiety nervousness or general discomfort. However someone running for vice president of the United States with a reasonable chance of becoming president should not laugh at questions about policies that could have a huge impact on the lives of millions of Americans. Biden and Harris for one reason or another refuse to answer fundamental policy questions that every American has a right to know before he or she votes in an election that could have major repercussions. Some things just aren’t funny. Socialism in America is certainly one of them. Chris Talgo ([email protected]) is an editor at The Heartland Institute.
