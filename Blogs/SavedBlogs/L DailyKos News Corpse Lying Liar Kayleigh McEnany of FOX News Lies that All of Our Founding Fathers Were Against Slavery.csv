L, Lying Liar Kayleigh McEnany of FOX News Lies that 'All of Our Founding Fathers Were Against Slavery', News Corpse, 2021-07-06, There is one unmistakably common characteristic of Donald Trump's administration and particularly his press office. It was a festering morass of lies and liars. And no one did it better than his last press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Which is why she was so quickly hired by Fox News after Trump was booted from the White House. McEnany's aversion to the truth has been a hallmark of her public life. Examples of her deliberate dishonesty are abundant. They run the gamut from falsely asserting that the the Mueller report was a “complete and total exoneration” of Trump to supporting Trump's "Big Lie" that there was “ample evidence of fraud” in the 2020 presidential election. Now McEnany is aiming for disinformer immortality. On Tuesday's episode of Outnumbered on Fox news McEnany made this shockingly ignorant claim:  Fox's Kayleigh McEnany amazingly claims that "all of our main founding fathers were against slavery recognized the evils of it."The majority of signers of the Declaration of Independence owned slaves 41 of 56 according to one study. https://t.co/mGCZzHpR7n pic.twitter.com/hkz1xglcGn  The segment began with McEnany bravely defending the 4th of July from "Democrats left-wing activists and even the media" who she said "smeared the all-American holiday." Which of course they didn't do. However her comment demonstrated the hate that she was trying to project on Democrats. You can't call others "haters" while you're lying about them "smearing" a patriotic holiday. Even worse McEnany appears to be totally unfamiliar with American history. While accusing the left of "getting facts wrong" she takes a million mile detour from the factual world. The truth about America's Founding Fathers may be difficult for her and others to admit but it isn't in dispute. Most of them were "owners" of enslaved men women and children. And those who weren't tolerated the practice in order to hold the newly formed union together. This is typical of how Fox News warps reality to stuff their square racist peg into their round white supremacist hole. They simply don't care about facts that conflict with their pre-determined narrative. And they obviously know that their audience doesn't care either or is too stupid to tell the difference. But you can count on this appeal to bigotry and ignorance to be featured throughout the coming midterm elections and into the next presidential cycle. It is the only thing they have to run on.
