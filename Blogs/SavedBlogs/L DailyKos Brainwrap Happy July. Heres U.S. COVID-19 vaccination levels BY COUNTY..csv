L, Happy July. Here's U.S. COVID-19 vaccination levels BY COUNTY., Brainwrap, 2021-07-06, It's been over a month since I last ran a scatter plot displaying current COVID-19 vaccination rates across every COUNTY nationwide according to the 2020 election results...all 3100+ of them. With today being the 4th of July which also happens to be the target date for President Biden's call for at least 70% of all U.S. adults to have received their first vaccination shot. As many have noted no we didn’t QUITE reach that goal nationally though many states have already far exceeded it. Nationally we came in at a little over 67% of all U.S. adults. Of course that target was 70% of all adults not the entire population. Adolescents age 12- 17 can also get vaccinated...and COVID-19 doesn't care about whether the FDA has approved a vaccine for children under 12 or not. When you divide into the entire U.S. population...which is what really matters in terms of the ultimate goal of reaching herd immunity...the 4th of July target was actually only around 53.9%...and the actual national status as of yesterday was just 50.8%. The exact vaccination threshold we need in order to achieve herd immunity isn't known. Via the Yale School of Medicine from May 2021: The percentage of the population that needs to be immune to attain herd immunity varies by disease and how contagious that disease is. Measles for example spreads so easily that an estimated 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. In turn the remaining 5% have protection because at 95% coverage measles will no longer spread. For polio the threshold is about 80%. It’s important to note that herd immunity can be measured at the global national and community level and changes over time. So if vaccination rates for a highly contagious disease go down in one pocket of the country for example the disease can resurface and spread in that area. “In 2019 there was a measles outbreak in Clark County Washington when the vaccination rate in public schools went down to 77 percent. That’s what happens when the vaccination numbers dip” Dr. Foxman says. Viruses like the flu however are different from measles in that they mutate over time meaning antibodies from a previous infection won’t provide protection for long. That’s why the flu vaccine is reformulated each year to match what is expected to be the dominant strain in the coming season. Likewise the virus that causes COVID-19 has been mutating. While the authorized vaccines are effective against the current strains circulating in the U.S. researchers do not yet know how long immunity to COVID-19 lasts after infection or vaccination. So a booster shot [an additional vaccine dose] of some kind may well be necessary Dr. Juthani says. At the start of the pandemic figures like 60 to 70% were given as estimates of how much of the population would need immunity from the coronavirus in order to reach herd immunity. With the increase in variants which are more infectious and could potentially impact the effectiveness of the vaccines that percentage is now estimated to be higher—some say up to 85%. And it has become more difficult to pin down. With the more aggressive Delta variant now spreading quickly among the unvaccinated in the U.S. 85% seems to be the more likely threshold which will be needed. For the updated graph below I've made a few more tweaks to both my data sources and the graph itself neither of which makes that much of a difference in terms of impact on the final results: With all of this in mind comparing my county-level analysis from May 25th (over 5 weeks ago) until today reveals a critical change: A few key highlights: Yes that's right: The second and fourth worst-vaccinated counties in America are both named McPherson. I have no idea what that means.
