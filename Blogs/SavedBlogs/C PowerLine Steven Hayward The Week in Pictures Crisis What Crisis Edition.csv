C, The Week in Pictures: Crisis? What Crisis Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-20, Supposedly we’ll get a press conference from the figurehead atop the Harris-Biden Administration next week and I’m wondering what the over-under line is on whether “Vice President” Harris will be standing on the podium behind him. (“Dr.” Jill on call is a given.) Immigration? Never heard of it. I’ll look forward to Biden putting his fogginess to good use on this issue.                                           Headlines of the week:                           The two genders?     This person must have come from Texas.                And finally. . .  OKAY I WAS JUST KIDDING!  Here’s the real one:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
