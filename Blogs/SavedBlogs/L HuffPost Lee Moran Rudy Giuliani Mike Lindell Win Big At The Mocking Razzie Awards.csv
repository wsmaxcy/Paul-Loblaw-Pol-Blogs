L, Rudy Giuliani Mike Lindell Win Big At The Mocking Razzie Awards, Lee Moran, 2021-04-24, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell — peddlers of ex-President Donald Trump’s 2020 election lies — were the big winners at this year’s mocking Razzie Awards. Giuliani the former New York City mayor and ex-personal lawyer to Trump scooped the Worst Supporting Actor and Worst Screen Combo (alongside his pants zipper) gongs for that inadvertent performance in “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.” MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell meanwhile won the Worst Actor award for his bonkers conspiracy theory-filled “documentary” “Absolute Proof.” The film — which was banned from YouTube — also secured the award for Worst Picture. “Oh boy here come the demands for a recount” cracked the voice-over in the announcement video for the awards which celebrate the year’s worst films and performances ahead of Sunday’s Academy Awards.
