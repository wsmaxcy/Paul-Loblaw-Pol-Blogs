L, MO-Sen: Lucas Kunce (D) Calls For Ending The War On Drugs By Legalizing Marijuana, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-20, Received this e-mail today from Marine officer Lucas Kunce’s (D. MO) U.S. Senate campaign: Happy 4/20! I’ve got a simple message for you today: Let’s legalize it. By now it’s clear to most Americans that it’s time to make marijuana legal nationwide. But for years the massive corporations behind private prisons the insurance industry and pharmaceutical cartels have pushed our government to keep up a “War on Drugs” that’s cost billions in taxpayer dollars and led to the arrests of millions of Americans for nonviolent marijuana offenses. And those arrests disproportionately target – and harm – Black communities. Black Americans are 3-4 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana despite consuming it at the same rate as white Americans. It’s time for a new direction. It’s time to legalize weed. If you’re with us add your name to our new petition to show you support legalizing marijuana at the federal level and ending the War on Drugs. YES I'LL SIGN! When I’m in the U.S. Senate I’ll fight for legalization with everything I’ve got. But there’s no time to lose – our movement can start building grassroots momentum for legalization right now. Thank you for taking action today Lucas Click here to add your name.
