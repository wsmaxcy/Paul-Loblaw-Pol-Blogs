L, now with even greater disinformation MyPillow guy demands Biden's resignation, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-07-06, Like any bad siege cows are being flung over the parapets and Mike Lindell MyPillow guy demands the unconditional surrender of POTUS. The dam of truth has burst and the flood of disinformation will only drown the trumpist disinformed. Have fun storming the castle!  MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell this evening called on Joe Biden to resign from his post as president immediately. "He lost the election; he needs to admit that he lost the election and quit trying to destroy our country" he added. For months Lindell has promised that Trump would be back in office in August following a new inauguration. The MyPillow CEO revealed the date for Trump's takeover in an interview over the weekend. "By the time of the morning of August the 13th it will be the talk of the world" Lindell told conservative host Brannon Howse. "Let's get this election pulled down. Let's right the right. Let's get these communists out that have taken over and then you'll see." www.rawstory.com/...
