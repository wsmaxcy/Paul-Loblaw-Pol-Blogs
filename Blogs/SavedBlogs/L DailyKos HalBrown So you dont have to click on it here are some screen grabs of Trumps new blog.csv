L, So you don't have to click on it here are some screen grabs of Trump's new blog, HalBrown, 2021-05-05, UPDATED: To answer the question in my illustration you don’t click on their crap websites. Still if you’re interested in what’s on the website/blog/platform of the Lord High Shit Idiot you can get a general idea by looking at my screen grabs.  I have no doubt Trump was anticipating having his suspension from Facebook continued which was just announced and Twitter which hasn’t announced yet when he added to his donaldjtrump. com website turning it into something of a blog or platform. Here’s the BBC article where I found the link. Donald Trump has launched a new "communications" website which says it will publish content "straight from the desk" of the former US president.  Mr Trump was banned by Twitter and suspended by Facebook and YouTube after the Capitol riots in January. The former president has since been releasing statements by press release - which the new website will now host. Users will be able to like posts - and also share them on Twitter and Facebook accounts. Note the last sentence above. I am sure Trump is counting on his supporters doing this thus minimizing to some extent the impact of his suspension. Note too how easy it is for his bootlickers to share his messages on their Facebook and Twitter accounts: Update: If you clicked on that the first page of the simple dot com of his old website that opened this morning was this: As of noon EST this is what you see: If you X that out this is where you go: I wondered why Trump wouldn’t have set up his new communication tool so donaldjtrump dot com would go directly to his so-called “desk” or message page. The only reason I could think of is that he still wanted to make money off the old web address.  In order to get to the crappola you have to click on one of these: “About” is just braggadocio. I was struck by how dark the photo on two main pages were. It took me 30 seconds in Mac Photos to lighten it them. This suggests rank amateurs put together the pages. This example is from the News section (his on top mine on bottom). The messages from His Royal Pile of Crap are in the Desk and News links: Here’s an enlargement of the photo above begging the question what the f*ck is the book he’s signing his name in”?  This has been the reaction so far (from HUFFPOST)
