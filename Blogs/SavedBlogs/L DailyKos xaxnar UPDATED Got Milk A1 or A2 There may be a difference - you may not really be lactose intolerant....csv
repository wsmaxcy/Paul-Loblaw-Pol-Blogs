L, UPDATED: Got Milk? A1 or A2? There may be a difference - you may not really be lactose intolerant..., xaxnar, 2021-04-25, So…. my Facebook feed brought up a March 12 2014* Mother Jones article by Josh Harkinson: You’re Drinking the Wrong Kind of Milk. It’s an interesting story about something that needs a lot more research to nail down but if it proves out it could be useful. (And if it doesn’t prove out it shouldn’t leave anyone terribly worse off.) Here’s the gist: ...An emerging body of research suggests that many of the 1 in 4 Americans who exhibit symptoms of lactose intolerance could instead be unable to digest A1 a protein most often found in milk from the high-producing Holstein cows favored by American and some European industrial dairies. The A1 protein is much less prevalent in milk from Jersey Guernsey and most Asian and African cow breeds where instead the A2 protein predominates. “We’ve got a huge amount of observational evidence that a lot of people can digest the A2 but not the A1” says Keith Woodford a professor of farm management and agribusiness at New Zealand’s Lincoln University who wrote the 2007 book Devil in the Milk: Illness Health and the Politics of A1 and A2 Milk. “More than 100 studies suggest links between the A1 protein and a whole range of health conditions”—everything from heart disease to diabetes to autism Woodford says though the evidence is far from conclusive. As usual with food stories it’s difficult to make a definitive judgement without more research. Everyone is slightly different when it comes to how they react to food. The bacteria in your digestive tract can be a factor. Milk also has some controversy around it from the environmental impact of cattle cow burps the economics of industrial scale milk production and the way cattle are treated to boost milk production. (You’ll never think the same way about milk after reading Piers Anthony’s short story “In The Barn”. Not for the squeamish — seriously disturbing.) TANSTAAFL if you think plant-based substitutes are better for the environment —  they are but not without trade-offs of their own. There are commercial incentives to play up the differences and the science is far from settled. Nonetheless this article is of interest because if the difference between A1 and A2 protein content in milk turns out to be significant for some people it’s worth following up. Read the whole thing.  It should be mentioned that dairy farming isn’t just about food production — it’s a way of life. Farmers and their cattle have a personal relationship we don’t really appreciate as end consumers. If this provides an opening for boutique dairy farming  with A2 breeds as part of a sustainable farming effort that might not be a bad outcome.  * UPDATE: Oops — wgreview caught in comments how old this article is — from 2014. So should see if there’s newer data — and there is... From 2017 — seems to confirm the results reported in the article but...  It is important for people considering A2 milk to know that the a2 Milk Company and the dairy industry have funded most of the studies on A2 milk. From 2019: Progressive Dairy has this. ...Two current studies in the U.S. are being conducted and both are expected to conclude in 2023 which should help to better clarify if there are digestibility differences between A1A1 and A1A2 versus A2A2 milk she said.   ...Milk from A2A2 cows is considered a value-added specialty product and as such is typically priced higher than conventional milk although it seems to be priced slightly lower than Organic Valley’s Grassmilk at least in the regional Northeast marketplace. Cheese and yogurt made with A2 milk are now available although there has been some controversy about whether or not good cheese can be made from A2 milk Tomasula said. What all of this means for dairy farmers remains to be seen. March 2021 A look at possible health risks from A1. Recommendations for ClientsWhile there may be an association between A1 and inflammation-related GI concerns RDs can communicate that there’s no evidence A1 causes cancer. And while clients may connect GI distress they experience with milk containing A1 protein these symptoms may have other causes such as lactose intolerance. Practitioners may recommend clients track their symptoms after consuming cow’s milk to see whether it may be strongly associated with their GI distress followed by a test to determine whether lactose intolerance is present. If lactose intolerance is present RDs can counsel them based on lactose intolerance guidelines.6 Conversely if the GI distress isn’t due to lactose intolerance dietitians can recommend A2 milk or fortified soymilk. A2 milk is free of the A1 protein and has the same nutrient profile as conventional cow’s milk and fortified soymilk is recommended by the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans as an appropriate dairy substitute making both nutritious choices. emphasis added I wouldn’t call any of this definitive but the original claims for A2 over A1 proteins in milk seem to be holding up so far.
