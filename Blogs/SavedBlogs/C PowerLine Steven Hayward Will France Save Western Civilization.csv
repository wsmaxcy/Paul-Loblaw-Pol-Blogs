C, Will *France* Save Western Civilization?, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-29, Back in February we took prominent notice of how French President Macron and a number of other leading French officials decried the poisonous ideas emanating from American universities which has led me to wonder why there aren’t at least ten Republican governors taking the same line. (So far the only one who has and only to a limited extent is Florida’s De Santis.) Well the next shoe has dropped over in France. Earlier this week about 1200 military officers some retired but many still in active ranks issued a statement decrying the “mortal danger” France faces from increasing violence from you-know-who. Our friends at the Claremont Institute posted a translation of the document noting in their introduction: Harris Interactive polling shows 58% of the French people support the letters’ signatories. Despite strenuous elite attempts to delegitimize even thinking such thoughts 84% of those polled can see that violence in the country is increasing daily. A full 73% agree France is in decline. Here’s the whole statement: Mister President
Members of the Cabinet
Members of Parliament The hour is late France is in peril threatened by several mortal dangers. Though retired we remain soldiers of France and cannot under the present circumstances remain indifferent to the fate of our beautiful country. Our tricolor flags are not simply a piece of fabric; they are a symbol of tradition—the tradition of those who throughout the ages whatever the color of their skin or their religion served France and gave their lives for her. On these flags in golden letters is inscribed the motto “Honor and Fatherland.” Today our honor rests on denouncing the crumbling-apart of our fatherland. Crumbling-apart through a certain kind of anti-racism which has an explicit goal: to sow malaise on our soil up to and including hate between communities. Today some speak of racialism of indigenism and of anti-colonial theories but with these words those hateful and fanatical partisans seek to foment a racial war. They despise our country her traditions her culture and want to watch her dissolve by tearing her away from her past and her history. Thus by attacking statues and analyzing words from several centuries ago their true goal is to undermine our ancient civil and military glories. Crumbling-apart through Islamism and the hordes from the Banlieues. Several patches of our nation have been detached and turned into territories put under submission to dogmas contrary to our Constitution. Every Frenchman regardless of belief or non-belief must be everywhere at home in France; there cannot and must not exist any city any neighborhood where the laws of the Republic do not have writ. Crumbling-apart when hate replaces fraternity during protests when the regime uses police as jackboots and scapegoats against yellow-vest-wearing compatriots who seek only to express their hopelessness. This even though ski-mask-wearing individuals infiltrate those protests destroy businesses and threaten the police. And yet the police only follow the sometimes-contradictory policies set out by you holders of political office. The peril rises violence increases every day. Who could have predicted ten years ago that a teacher could one day have his head cut off as he left his middle school? As servants of the Nation who have always been ready to pay the ultimate price for our service we cannot remain passive spectators of such actions. Therefore the leaders of our country must absolutely find the courage required to eradicate those dangers. To do so it is often necessary only to apply existing laws without weakness. Do not forget that like us a great majority of our fellow citizens is incensed by your cowardice and your guilty silences. As Cardinal Mercier Primate of Belgium once said: “When prudence is everywhere courage is nowhere.” Ladies and Gentlemen stop equivocating—the hour is late the work ahead is immense. Do not lose time and know that we are ready to support political leaders who would undertake the rescue of the Nation. However if nothing is done heedlessness will continue to spread its poison throughout society inexorably. In the end there will be an explosion and our comrades in active military service will be forced to step in and undertake the perilous mission of protecting our civilizational values and the lives of our fellow citizens. It is easy to see that the time for hesitation is over. Otherwise tomorrow civil war will put an end to this growing chaos and there will be thousands of deaths of which you will bear responsibility. (Christian Piquemal was the lead signatory to this letter. He headed the Foreign Legion.) Once again strange to contemplate that the French military—or at least a substantial plurality of its leadership—is more cleared-eyed about things than our increasingly woke military. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
