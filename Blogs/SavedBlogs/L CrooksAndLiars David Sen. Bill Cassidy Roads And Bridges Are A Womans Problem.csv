L, Sen. Bill Cassidy: 'Roads And Bridges Are A Woman's Problem', David, 2021-06-27, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  	Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) on Sunday insisted that infrastructure like roads and bridges is a "woman's problem" because they do the "shopping." 	Cassidy made the remarks on NBC's Meet the Press where he was arguing on behalf of a bipartisan infrastructure bill. 	"If you go home and talk to constituents who are stuck in traffic for an hour and a half getting to work and an hour and a half getting home -- three hours a day that they don't spend with their family -- they want a bridge coming to a town near them" Cassidy explained. 	"My wife says that roads and bridges are a woman's problem if you will" the senator added. "Because oftentimes it is the woman -- aside from commuting to work -- who's also taking children to schools or doing the shopping. And the more time that she spends on that road the less time she spends doing things of higher value." For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
