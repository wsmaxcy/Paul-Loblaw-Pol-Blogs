L, If you're angry you're not "convulsing.", KurtEichenwald, 2021-05-01, I’m sorry to do this here. But it’s really important and I believe this community is empathetic to understand why. I put this as a comment to a posting that used the word “convulsing” in the headline but it is buried deep and I want people to see it.  Folks...”convulsing”  has one meaning which — because of what it looks like — has been turned into a slang that is used to mean variations of “getting furious.” As one of millions who has experienced convulsions from epilepsy please don’t do this. Convulsions are — after we wake up — painful and terrifying. We can be horribly injured (I woke up once having knocked over a pot of boiling water onto myself while falling and then not reacting as it burned.) They are horrible beyond anything I could have imagined before they started. This usage makes them seem not only like they are not that big a deal but also that they are within our control. The epilepsy community struggles a lot to get people to understand what we face. We are often ridiculed we are often isolated because of people being frightened of us we are fired from jobs/thrown out of school/arrested (I’ve been all three) because of fear and ignorance about what it is. Using the terminology of this disease metaphorically just sets that back. And while I have your attention: Never hold someone down during a convulsion and never put spoons etc. in our mouths. And if the seizure has begun never put anything of any kind in our mouths.
