L, On Right & Left (with poll), linkage, 2021-04-19,  This is an Open Thread / Coffee Hour and all topics of conversation are welcome. What is for dinner? How are you doing? What is on your mind. If you are new to Street Prophets please introduce yourself below in a comment. Today's Coffee Hour is brought to you by the dichotomy between Right and Left. Common sense would have us believe that there is a functional equivalence between the two world views held by the Right and Left. Both are approaches to governance and both are currently the fighting for control of the United States. But as most readers of Daily Kos know  there is no middle ground or compromise position with the Right.  So the question is:  Should we cut our selves off from the Right as suggested by Matthew 5:30?  Or should we continue to engage as we have been doing? Jump the fold for a bit more on this topic.  And please take the poll below only after you have read the Daily Kos article referenced below. What is for dinner? How are you doing?

What got me thinking about the Left / Right convention was these two recent articles from Daily Kos:  1) The "Unum Test": a plea for bipartisanship that is totally partisan  by krotor and  What if GOP Never Negotiates Again? by Save the clock Tower. Krotor decisively presents the case that any compromise with the Right is false on the face of it.  And Save the clock tower convinced me that the Right has given up on even trying to negotiate in good faith. So what do we do?  My experience with a Right winger so far has been to make any talk of politics off limits.  Over the last five or six years explicitly told my acquaintance I had nothing to say about politics.   I kept all our conversations about business.  Maybe I’m lucky but my acquaintance cought on and did not talk about politics.  Accept for one moment after the January 6 2021 Storming of the United States Capitol. My acquaintance mentioned he thought it was wrong.  I said nothing. I guess what I’m trying to say is I reject cutting all ties with my few Right wing acquaintances as suggested by Mathew 5:30.  However I do understand the futility of getting in an argument with them. Thus I do not discuss politics with them. Should we cut ourselves off from the Right as suggested by Matthew 5:30?
