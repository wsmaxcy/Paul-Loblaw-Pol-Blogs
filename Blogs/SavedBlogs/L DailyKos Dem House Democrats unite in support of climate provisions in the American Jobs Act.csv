L, House Democrats unite in support of climate provisions in the American Jobs Act, Dem, 2021-07-01, A strong majority of House Democrats signed onto a letter supporting keeping climate change provisions in the American Jobs Act. Their signature on the letter along with the message sent by House progressives makes clear that no infrastructure bill will pass Congress without them.   More than 120 members led by Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) and spanning the ideological spectrum from Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) to centrist Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) are reiterating their support for measures like a clean energy standard significant electric vehicle investments and 10-year clean energy tax credits as part of the eventual agreement. It’s a signal that Democrats across the ideological spectrum want strong climate change action as part of any legislative action this year.  It comes as House progressives underscored this week they would not vote for an infrastructure package without sufficient provisions to address climate change. Democratic leadership can only afford to lose four votes on any particular bill to ensure passage. More asks: The letter comes on the heels of one from a dozen Senate Democrats urging the Biden administration to provide $200 billion in natural infrastructure restoration and resilience as part of the infrastructure process including $10 billion toward a Civilian Climate Corps. It is unclear that the movement led by AOC whose message says “Biden you coward” contributed to this process at all.   I am amazed that people who presumably graduated high school don’t understand that there are three branches of government and that the executive branch isn’t the legislative branch. If climate change doesn’t make it in the infrastructure bill(s)  then it will be because of Senators Manchin and Sinema not President Biden. If President Biden didn’t support including climate change in the infrastructure deal then he would not have included it in his plan.  As Dan Pfeiffer and Jon Favreau pointed out in one of their podcasts every bill passed makes it harder to pass the next bill and every dollar spent makes it harder to get the next dollar. Climate change is an existential threat and must be addressed. It is wrong to pass an infrastructure bill without addressing climate change.  I support therefore no climate no deal. That may not be popular among some who would decide on whether or not to vote to pass a bill based strictly upon whether or not it would make things better than they are. I understand that argument. However if infrastructure is passed without climate change being addressed it will be next to impossible to address it later on its own. It is near impossible to get anything passed due to Senators Manchin and Sinema and the filibuster and the extremist Senate Republicans. If this is passed without addressing climate change in some other reconciliation bill then it won’t be passed this Congress. I see no chance that Senators Manchin and Sinema would support a climate change alone bill via reconciliation. We may lose control of Congress after the 2022 midterms. Therefore it seems likely that is now or not in the foreseeable future. Thus it must be now.
