L, Sean Hannity Goes Full Nihilist Over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Climate Plans, Lee Moran, 2021-05-06, Fox News personality Sean Hannity on Wednesday offered a selfish and nihilistic response to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-N.Y.) concerns for the environment and her signature policy proposal the Green New Deal. On Wednesday’s episode of “The Sean Hannity Show” on Premiere Radio Networks Hannity railed against the New York Democrat’s plan for a 1.5 million-strong climate corps to work on federally funded projects addressing climate change. He suggested Ocasio-Cortez was instilling fear in President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Then came the nihilism: Remember she told us what a year or two ago that we only had 12 years left the planet that’s it. We only have 10 years to fix it. I’m like if it’s done in 12 years oh to hell with it. Let’s just have a big party and you know eat drink and barbecue and be merry because we’re not going to be able to fix it the way she’s proposing. Not enough money. You can’t even print the money for this. Listen to Hannity’s comments here: Ocasio-Cortez in 2019 did claim the “world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” A United Nations panel highlighted the terminal danger to the planet if the crisis isn’t addressed. Conservatives took the “12 years” warning literally using it to attack Ocasio-Cortez. To which she fired back on Twitter: This is a technique of the GOP to take dry humor + sarcasm literally and “fact check” it.Like the “world ending in 12 years” thing you’d have to have the social intelligence of a sea sponge to think it’s literal.But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows. https://t.co/pmkwrdeAnq
