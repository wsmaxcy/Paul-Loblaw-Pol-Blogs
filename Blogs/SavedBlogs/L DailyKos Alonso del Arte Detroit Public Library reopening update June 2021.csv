L, Detroit Public Library reopening update June 2021, Alonso del Arte, 2021-06-30, Because of the unexpectedly high flooding last Saturday the Main Library of the Detroit Public Library will be closed through next Monday. I suspect it will take longer than that to clean up from the flooding these things usually take longer than we’d like. Note that next Monday is July 5 which becomes the official observance of Independence Day because July 4 falls on a Sunday this year. For years the Main Library didn’t open on Mondays regardless but the regular schedule now during this coronavirus pandemic calls for it be open for limited service on non-holiday Mondays from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. The Main Library is sometimes called “the Main Branch.” That’s a misnomer. In any case most of the branches remain closed and they’ve been closed since before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-Michigan) issued the first stay-at-home order last year. Once flood cleanup is completed at the Main Library and it reopens the Detroit Public Library will be back to its previous service level of limited service at the Main Library and six branches (Campbell Edison Jefferson Parkman Redford Wilder). There’s also the Mobile Library helps a little bit in filling the gap created by the couple dozen of currently fully closed branches. The question remains will the Main Library and all the branches reopen to full service and if so when? Next year according to a page on the Detroit Public Library website that was updated a week ago. Beginning July 12 2021 the Detroit Public Library will offer more in-person service hours at the Main Library and six branch locations: Campbell Edison Jefferson Parkman Redford and Wilder. These service hours will remain in effect through June 30 2022. Then hopefully a year from today all the currently closed branches will reopen restored to their previous levels of service. As of today Michigan is still a couple of tenths of a percentage point shy of 62% partial vaccination. The numbers in Wayne County (which Detroit is a big part of) are slightly better. But when you drill down to Detroit it’s very discouraging: only 38.1% as of today. Can we get to 70% in a year? I hope so. Many people have been asking if the current branch closures are due to the library’s finances. While COVID-19 has impacted our budget these changes were not made as a cost-saving measure. We explored many service models and chose this option as a safe manageable and sustainable way to offer library service. That makes sense to me since Many of our locations cannot support COVID-related safety protocols. Many of our buildings are too small to accommodate social distancing or have an inadequate ventilation system. Offering additional service hours at our current sites was our safest and most manageable option for us. Well maybe it could be done at Skillman downtown. But it’s definitely out of the question for the Bowen Branch. At that branch you can cover a range of two hundred integers in the Dewey decimal classification in six feet. Using Bowen Branch as a vaccination site is out of the question. But there are currently lots of vaccination sites in Detroit many more than there are open libraries. Of course going back to the library is hardly an incentive to get vaccinated. And unfortunately incentives like cash prizes and free donuts aren’t doing much better...
