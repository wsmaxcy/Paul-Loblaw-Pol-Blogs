L, Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Vaccine Appointment) - Joe Biden hear my prayer!, exNYinTX, 2021-04-18,   I haven't posted a diary in over 15 years so please be gentle. I’ve been watching this video multiple times a day for the last week. Originally saw it on twitter and naturally assumed that somebody would post it to dailykos.com because it is sublime on so many levels. However after doing a search I don’t see that it’s been posted by anybody else which is surprising. The production choreography and voice of the main character are almost too professional for a simple youtube video. And I think the main character has more outfit changes in this 4 and a 1/2 minute clip than Cher does in a 2 hour concert! Plus the shady black market vaccine seller's shady dance is :chefs kiss: perfection. This is originally an Abba song from their Voulez-Vous album released in 1979 and redone by Cher in 2018 on her Dancing Queen album. This is a Sour Pickles TV music parody https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v509w85NGOc (I have no affiliation with this group or this video just admiration for a job well done.) The only thing I contributed is copying the lyrics from the video and pasting them down below. I agree that getting your vaccine(s) doesn’t mean you should stop wearing a face mask. I’m not advocating for that nor do I think the creators of this video are advocating for that. I’m just pointing out that this video is amazing to me and hopefully you’ll enjoy it also.
