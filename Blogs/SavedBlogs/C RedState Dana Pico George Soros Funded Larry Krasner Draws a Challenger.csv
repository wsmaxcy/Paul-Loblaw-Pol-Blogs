C, George Soros Funded Larry Krasner Draws a Challenger, Dana Pico, 2020-12-12, I have written frequently about District Attorney Larry Krasner the anti-police crusader that George Soros helped get elected in foul fetid fuming foggy filthy Philadelphia. Mr Krasner ran promising to completely overhaul the prosecutor’s office to: Wikipedia noted of Mr Krasner: In his first week in office Mr Krasner fired 31 prosecutors from the District Attorney’s Office including both junior and career supervisory staff. Up to one-third of the homicide prosecutors in the office were dismissed. Those fired represented nearly a 10% reduction in the number of Philadelphia assistant district attorneys. In February 2018 Krasner announced that law enforcement would no longer pursue criminal charges against those caught with marijuana possession. That same month Krasner instructed prosecutors to stop seeking cash bail for those accused of some misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies. Krasner said that it was unfair to keep people in detention simply because they could not afford bail. He also announced that the DA’s office had filed a lawsuit against a number of pharmaceutical companies for their role in the city’s opioid epidemic. Krasner instructed prosecutors to stop charging sex workers who had fewer than three convictions. In March 2018 it was reported that Krasner’s staffers were working on creating a sentence review unit–the first of its kind in the country–to review past cases and sentences and seek re-sentencing in cases when individuals were given unduly harsh punishments. Also in March 2018 it was reported that Krasner instructed prosecutors to: “Offer shorter prison sentences in plea deals. Decline certain classes of criminal charges. And explain on the record why taxpayers should fork over thousands of dollars per year to incarcerate people.” He said Fiscal responsibility is a justice issue and it is an urgent justice issue. A dollar spent on incarceration should be worth it. Otherwise that dollar may be better spent on addiction treatment on public education on policing and on other types of activity that make us all safer. Given the approximately 40% increase in homicides in the city this year from 2019 a year which had the highest number of killings since 2007 it doesn’t seem as though Mr Krasner’s ideas have made anyone safer. Well now the District Attorney has drawn a primary opponent for next year’s campaign: by Laura McCrystal | December 11 2020 | 5:02 PM EST A former Philadelphia homicide prosecutor who was among the staffers fired when District Attorney Larry Krasner took office will challenge the incumbent in next year’s Democratic primary. Carlos Vega who worked in the District Attorney’s Office for 35 years and was the first Latino homicide prosecutor in Pennsylvania has been a vocal critic of Krasner. He plans to formally announce his candidacy Wednesday. Vega left the District Attorney’s Office in January 2018 when Krasner fired 31 staffers during his first week. He filed a lawsuit against Krasner last year alleging that his firing was based on age discrimination. Krasner has denied the firing was related to age and the lawsuit is still pending in federal court. Vega said in an interview Friday that his campaign will focus on victims of crime and their families who have accused Krasner’s office of failing to keep them updated and excluding them from decisions. What? A prosecutor focusing on the victims of crimes and their families rather than Mr Krasner’s coddling of criminals? That’s kind of what the black community said they wanted according to Thursday’s Philadelphia Inquirer but then again the same people want cop killer Wesley Cook who uses the fake name ‘Mumia Abu-Jamal’ released from prison and want the police department defunded. Mr Krasner should run on his record: 353 homicides his first year up from 315 in 2017 356 in 2019 and now up to 466 so far this year. With 20 days left to go in 2020 Philly has already seen its 3rd highest murder total in history is on pace to easily break 1989’s 2nd place record of 489 and might just challenge 1990’s all time record of 505. If Mr Krasner is re-elected after that record then the City of Brotherly Love will have gotten what it deserves. George Soros money got another ‘social justice’ district attorney elected in Los Angeles and he’s already doing the same stuff Mr Krasner has done. Black Lives Matter? It sure doesn’t seem that they do in Philadelphia where black men are being murdered every single day and the District Attorney is more concerned about the murderers than the murdered. Would Mr Vega be a better District Attorney than Mr Krasner? We can’t know if he would be much better but one thing is certain; he couldn’t be any worse. The Inquirer article does have a link to a fund-raising site for Mr Vega but given that it’s an Act Blue site I will not link it. The site says that Mr Vega “worked to overturn wrongful convictions” so he might just be on the social justicey side himself just not as bad as Mr Krasner. What Philadelphia really needs is a tough and I mean tough on crime Police Commissioner and District Attorney people who will do for Philly what Rudy Giuliani did for New York City catch and prosecute harshly the petty crooks when they are “Johnny Misdemeanor” before they become “Johnny Felony.”
