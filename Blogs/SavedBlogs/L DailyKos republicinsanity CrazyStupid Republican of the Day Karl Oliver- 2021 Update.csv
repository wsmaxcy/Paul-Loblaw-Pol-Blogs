L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Karl Oliver- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-05-09, On this date one in both 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” profiled Karl Oliver a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from District 46 who was elected to his first term in office back in 2015. Oliver made national news in March of 2017 when he got his knickers in a twist as the city of New Orleands tore down several of its Confederate monuments and compared people who wanted iconography that honors a rebellion against the federal government fought over slavery to Nazis before calling for those who remove the Confederate monuments to be “LYNCHED”: “The destruction of these monuments erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans is both heinous and horrific. If the and I use this term extremely loosely “leadership” of Louisiana wishes to in a Nazi-ish fashion burn books or destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY they should be LYNCHED! Let it be known I will do all in my power to prevent this from happening in our State.” Make no mistake this is beyond f***ed up if it was said anywhere but particularly in Money Mississippi which Karl Oliver represents because it’s the same place where Emmett Till was lynched for whistling at a white woman (who admitted on her deathbed he actually didn’t) in 1955. Calls for Oliver to resign came from within the legislature and without and even sparked an FBI investigation.We’ll add as well that Karl Oliver is quite the extremist supporting some of the most hardline conservative bills in the Mississippi state legislature including one to bring back the electric chair and firing squads as a means of execution (go figure he guy who called for people to be lynched likes all sorts of barbaric execution methods) anti-choice fetal heartbeat legislation that would ban abortion as early as six weeks effectively (before many women realize they are even pregnant) is so “pro-life” that he’s also trying to widen the amount of exceptions available for vaccinations (exactly the attitude needed during a viral pendemic) voted for legislation to ignore federal firearms laws as well as to legalize the carrying of firearms in churches.Alas Karl Oliver ignored all calls to resign and we are sad to report that nobody filed to run against him by the deadline of March 1st 2019. Oliver will remain in office until 2023 with an outlook on race relations that we should have left back in 1865 if not earlier. And don’t think the rest of the Mississippi GOP are holding him accountable… they actually elevated him to be the chairman of the Mississippi state House’s Appropriations Committee.       One Year Ago May 9th 2020: Karl Oliver(MS)… 2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago May 9th 2019: Karl Oliver(MS)… Original ProfileTwo Years Ago May 9th 2018: Wyatt “Tommy” Tucker (NC)… 2018 UpdateThree Years Ago May 9th 2017: Wyatt “Tommy” Tucker (NC)… 2017 UpdateFour Years Ago May 9th 2016: Wyatt “Tommy” Tucker (NC)… 2016 UpdateFive Years Ago May 9th 2015: Wyatt “Tommy” Tucker (NC)… Original Profile
