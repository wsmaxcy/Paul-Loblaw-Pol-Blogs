C, The Marvelous Rummy, Steven Hayward, 2021-07-01, I don’t really have anything to add to Tevi Troy’s fine remembrance of Donald Rumsfeld that appears in City Journal but it is worth passing along a couple of exhibits about why he was the kind of person who we should wish to have in greater supply. First his classic letter to the IRS which I think everyone ought to copy and send in with their own Form 1040 every year with a copy sent to their member of Congress:  And this short memo to Doug Feith is classic too featuring none of the usual bureaucratic language used to lard up most such communications in government agencies:    Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
