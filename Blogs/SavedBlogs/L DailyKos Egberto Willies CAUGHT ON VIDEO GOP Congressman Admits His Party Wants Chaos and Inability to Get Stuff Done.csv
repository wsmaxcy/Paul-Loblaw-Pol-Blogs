See full episodes here. Common Dreams reported the following. Newly leaked video footage of a recent event hosted by the right-wing group Patriot Voices shows Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas openly admitting that his party wants "18 more months of chaos and the inability to get stuff done" as President Joe Biden a bipartisan group of senators and congressional Democrats work to pass climate and infrastructure legislation. "Honestly right now for the next 18 months our job is to do everything we can to slow all of that down to get to December of 2022" Roy says in the clip referring to the month after that year's midterm elections. Republicans need to flip just a handful of seats to take back the House and Senate. "I don't vote for anything in the House of Representatives right now" Roy says in response to an audience member's question about the sweeping infrastructure and safety-net package that Democrats are planning to pass unilaterally alongside a White House-backed bipartisan deal. In the video that emerged Tuesday the Texas Republican dismisses the Democratic reconciliation package—which progressives hope will include at least $6 trillion in spending on climate programs Medicare expansion and other priorities left out of the bipartisan plan—as "liberal garbage."
