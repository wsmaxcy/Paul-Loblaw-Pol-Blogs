L, New Day Cafe: Tuesday Ins and Outs, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-05-04, Good morning Cafe! I’m feeling a bit cheugy this morning….although with the odd things I like I’m not really sure if that applies.  I likes what I likes and am long past caring if I’m hip cool with it or just out of touch.  As long as I’m in touch with my inner moppet….it’s a good day!  ;)  Before we go any further...have a cuppa and a nice noshy!    I was delighted by samantha’s diary from yesterday...and no matter what anyone else sez...I think it was cool!  That said I’ve discovered that some of the things I like are decidedly UNcool.  Don’t misunderstand it’s not that I care...more like I was surprised.  You mean I can’t wear Birkenstocks anymore??  Drat!  (heh) My uncool stuff?  I still love Harry Potter.  It’s like spending time back in my childhood.  The Original Years.  I’ve always adored fairy tales so that fits.  I like knock-knock jokes and bad puns and children’s stories of what they did recently.  Trips to the zoo are always a knockout. The Cool Club for trendy drinks left me behind years ago….craft beers are good as long as they’re….good.  Mixed drinks….I have a fondness for strawberry margaritas and few others.  Marti’s Law: Never drink anything named for something that can hurt you!!  Wine...whatever tastes good with whatever we’re eating...or by itself if it tastes good. See?  I am so untrendy it squeaks! What do you love that isn’t anywhere near trendy hip cool or “in”??
