C, George Soros Tom Steyer and Their Fellow Radicals Invade a House Republican Primary, Seton Motley, 2021-05-18, If you can’t beat them – pretend to join them. The Left knows its ideas are terrible.  And thus very unpopular in all but the most ridiculously partisan portions of the country.  So running to win as Democrats – the Party of the Left – is rarely a good idea. So you cheat.  You do things like run Leftist candidates as fake Republicans. I saw a great deal of this while living in Texas in the 2000s.  A bunch of trial lawyers funded a bunch of “Republican” primary candidates in state House and Senate races.  Looking to defeat actual conservative candidates – and populate the Capitol with their guys…just wearing different Party hats. Of course this is evergreen chicanery.  It is practiced all the time everywhere – at all levels of government. Like in Ohio – right now. Stewart Announces Run for Congress: “Brian Stewart District 78 Representative to the Ohio House…has announced his bid for U.S. Congress.” Stewart is an alleged Republican state Rep – running to be an alleged Republican US Congressman.  In his announcement he talks a little bit of a good game: “Th(e)se challenges – whether from the extreme left or an adversarial nation – must be dealt with aggressively and with conviction.” Speaking of “the extreme left” – remember George Soros? George Soros: Godfather of the Left: “Say the name George Soros and liberals see dollar signs – literally…. “(I)nstead of gaining a mighty reputation for his philanthropy or his investment prowess Soros is reviled abroad and criticized here in his adopted country.  Most everywhere Soros his foundations or his investing have gone trouble has followed. He’s helped foment revolutions undermined national currencies and funded radicals around the world.” George Soros Emerges as Major Funder of ‘Global Climate Strike’ Groups Speaking of “the extreme left” – remember Tom Steyer? ‘Steyerville’: Website Tracks Communities Smothered by Radical Environmentalism: “A new website is tracking once-thriving communities fallen on hard times due to environmental activism billionaire Tom Steyer funded The Washington Free Beacon reported. “Steyerville.com launched Thursday by Power the Future (PTF) a non-profit that advocates the benefits of fossil fuels. The website holds an interactive map displaying the stories of communities in three states smothered by environmental policies. “‘We started Steyerville to demonstrate the danger the eco-left poses…’ PTF Executive Director Daniel Turner told The Free Beacon.” Soros and Steyer are enviro-mental.  They fund LOTS of highly destructive and insane environmental things.  Like funding fake conservatives pretending to be Republicans – so as to advance their highly destructive and insane environmental things. And now we’ve arrived at our harmonic convergence moment.  Stewart is a Soros-Steyer Republican. Please enjoy the following awful awfully uncritical reporting.  With the hard-sell inflation of the “conservative” credentials of Stewart and his fellow Soros-Steyer Republicans.  (The short article uses the word “conservative” twenty times.) Alternative Energy Freeze Debate Rages: “Members of Ohio’s conservative community gathered at the Ohio Statehouse Thursday to announce the launch of the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum a coalition designed to be a voice for conservative support for a common-sense all-of-the-above state energy policy. The announcement comes as the Ohio General Assembly considers updates to Ohio’s clean energy standards. “Mike Hartley a seasoned conservative grassroots leader in Ohio serves as OHCEF’s executive director…. “The OHCEF Leadership Council is made up of…Brian Stewart….” So Stewart is leading this environmental group.  Proudly so – here’s his Tweet proudly announcing it. Well he was proudly leading it.  He’s no longer listed on the website – and hasn’t been since April 2018. Perhaps because he realized being a Soros-Steyer Republican isn’t such a good idea when planning to run for higher Republican office. Speaking of Steyer – guess who funds the environmental group Stewart proudly led?  A LOT of the usual Leftist suspects – including Soros and Steyer. What Is the ‘Conservative Energy Network’ and Why Is It Backed by Leftist Funders? “Organizations that market themselves as conservative while pushing left-of-center energy policies with financial support from left-leaning foundations have been showing up in force…. “The self-described Conservative Energy Network an umbrella group for environmental activists who favor ‘clean energy solutions’ in the form of taxpayer-funded wind and solar boondoggles have been working to make inroads with conservative audiences…. “Take a hard look at what these foundations advocate and it becomes clear they are devoted to undermining cheap affordable energy sources while expanding the size and influence of government…. “(A report from the Civitas Institute a North Carolina free-market advocacy group details some of this funding. Other network members include The Western Way based in Denver the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum and the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum.” Emphasis ours.  Because there’s the group Stewart proudly led. Soros money is behind…just about everything Leftist.  His Tides Foundation kicked in coin to the Network.  And Steyer’s TomKat Charitable Trust/Foundation – kicked in $3 million. Oh: And President Joe Biden’s ridiculous “Climate Czar” Gina McCarthy?  She of the radical policy prescriptions and fake email accounts? She served on the Board of the same Leftist group alleged Republican Stewart had been proudly leading. Where there’s smoke – there’s fire. Where there are a bunch of enviro-radical Leftists totally surrounding an alleged Republican – the alleged Republican isn’t actually a Republican. He’s a Soros-Steyer Republican.  Which isn’t a Republican at all.
