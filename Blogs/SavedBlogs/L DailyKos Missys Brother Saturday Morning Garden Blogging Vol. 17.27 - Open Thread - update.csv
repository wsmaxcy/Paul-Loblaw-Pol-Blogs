L, Saturday Morning Garden Blogging Vol. 17.27 - Open Thread - update, Missys Brother, 2021-07-03, ***SMGB is highlighted in the Communitly Spotlight here: www.dailykos.com/... Sorry but apparently there is a hiccup this morning with the diary that was supposed to post and it didn’t publish to the front page. It was to be Progressive Penquin’s — Part 2 of his drought tolerant garden. Here’s the link to his diary and it only published under SMGB group and we couldn’t get it to the front page www.dailykos.com/... Today SMGB will be highlighted in the Community Spotlight and it’s important that we have a diary on the front page. Thus I threw this together in a few minutes so sorry there isn’t much meat.  This is also a quick hello as we are heading out for the day and I won’t be able to hang around long for comments.  selling at the flea market has been great. a guy bought this cow weathervane and three watering cans from me last week.  radish tops from my garden were sauteed and delicious constant stream of blooms in the yard wish this little guy was ours. Did you notice he’s a water fountain?  Ida D our rescue continues improving. here she is lying on floorboards from 1798 while watching me brush my teeth. The fact that she came to watch is huge. She has started wanting to hang with us just a bit.  Physical therapy has been fantastic for my knee this morning will be our third pickup at this red barn for our CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) share. It’s been interesting to say the least and we have sixteen more Saturdays to go Have a happy 4th everyone   P.S. Today will be the lowest high ever on July 3rd for the central CT Valley. A high of 62 which is perfect for me. I wish the Northwest could have these temps.
