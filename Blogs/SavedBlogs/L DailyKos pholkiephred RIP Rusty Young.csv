L, RIP Rusty Young, pholkiephred, 2021-04-21, Rusty Young founding and longest lasting member of Poco has died at 75.  With a career spanning from Buffalo Springfield thru the Covid-19 pandemic Rusty’s voice steel guitar acoustic and electric guitars and band leadership kept the first true country-rock band’s legacy alive despite a rotating group of collaborators.  I saw them around the time their live album Deliverin’ was released and they were just as dynamic with Rusty even bringing his pedal steel guitar down onto the floor on his knee while he played it Chuck Berry/duckwalking style.   RIP
