L, â€˜Gaslighting 101â€™: Sen. Ted Cruz Ripped For One Of His Biggest Boldest Lies Yet, Ed Mazza, 2021-04-23, Twitter users called out Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Thursday over an easily debunked claim he made about Republicans and the Supreme Court.Â  During a press conference to urge President Joe Biden to reject any attempt to expand the Supreme CourtÂ Cruz said: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX): "You didn't see Republicans when we had control of the Senate try to rig the game. You didn't see us try to pack the court." pic.twitter.com/reUU9WJU1d Critics were quick to point out that in 2016 Senate Republicans led by then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked then-President Barack Obamaâ€™s appointment of Merrick Garland to a Supreme Court seat for almost a year. At the time Republicans claimed that an open court seat could not be filled in an election year.Â  After Donald Trump won the 2016 election Garlandâ€™s nomination died. Senate Republicans thenÂ nixed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in 2017 to confirm Neil Gorsuch instead the first of three Trump appointments to the court.Â  In 2020 when Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died just weeks before the election Senate Republicans forgot the McConnell Rule about keeping such seats open and rushed to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the court.Â  Given those very recent events Cruzâ€™s critics werenâ€™t buying his claim that Republicans hadnâ€™t rigged the system to stack the court:Â  Gaslighting 101 on display here. Republicans practically sprained their ankles rushing to steal Ginsburgâ€™s seat before the election. https://t.co/bPxIdl4gXC Liars! Is it amnesia sniffing glue or too many free cocktails in first class to Cancun?!We remember the past few years: Cruz Mitch & crew: 1) stole a Sup. Court seat (Garland) 2) got rid of Sup Ct filibusters (Gorsuch) & in Oct. rewrote the rules to steal another (Barrett). https://t.co/nYJjAoLaNS That's... exactly what we saw. https://t.co/lg0cWvEzbu Irony is dead. https://t.co/EFsuRq0qV2 LOL biggest lie Iâ€™ve ever heard!! Wtf @tedcruz ðŸ˜†ðŸ¥´ðŸ™„ https://t.co/HiwRjggFs4 This is a lie. A demonstrable lie. https://t.co/zfmsyLtpWK https://t.co/vmysCS58G5 Youâ€™re a liar @tedcruz.  @GOP stole two seats while enabling Individual One to appoint A THIRD of the justices on Supreme Court of the United States FOR LIFE.  Sit down. https://t.co/O8NV2sdrY2 Republicans quite literally changed the number of seats on the court from 9 to 8 for an entire year and then re-added that seat once they were assured a Republican would fill it. https://t.co/u9fB0t2SHF motherfucker you packed the court faster than you packed your go-bag for cancun https://t.co/m8h57cJhFn Um....You shrunk it then packed it. https://t.co/TxGI84ZSZM Well...yes...that's EXACTLY what you did. If McConnell hadn't bent the rules to get Gorsuch and Barrett we wouldn't be here now... https://t.co/zL7ml1RMC5 Republicans wouldnâ€™t even give Merrick Garland a vote because it was an election year. Then they rammed Amy Coney Barrettâ€™s nomination through in a record 35 days because it was an election year. https://t.co/A7JRBrr6BJ yes we didyeswe did https://t.co/l1z5ut5CRw Just a reminder that had Clinton won in 2016 Cruz said that he planned on trying to keep the then-vacant Scalia seat open until a Republican took office again. https://t.co/TU0K34zdbo
