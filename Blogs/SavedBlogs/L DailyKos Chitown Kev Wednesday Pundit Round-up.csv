L, Wednesday Pundit Round-up, Chitown Kev, 2021-04-28, Good Morning everyone! Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post is very much liking the communications approach of President Biden’s administration. Lack of presidential broadcasting does not mean the administration is failing to communicate with the public. To the contrary with thrice weekly covid-19 task force briefings daily White House news briefings (often with a top administration official) and a blizzard of fact sheets there is no shortage of information about the policies Biden is pursuing. What is striking is that this is a president unwilling to play pundit media critic or partisan campaigner (for now). The administration benefits in keeping the focus on substance when Republicans have so little substance to offer. Reporters and pundits regularly bemoan the sparseness of Biden’s interactions with the media but that is not governing; that is performance art for a media and political culture used to feeding off constant bickering over what the president said what he meant who he allegedly offended and the hyperfocus on “process.” Asked about passing the infrastructure package as a reconciliation bill Klain gave the sports cliche that the administration focuses on “one game at a time.” He explained Biden’s legislative strategy is to take things “to do as much as we can on a bipartisan basis through regular order.” No venom at Republicans. No despair that the GOP is largely still in the thrall of the MAGA radicals. (BTW in times like these it really helps that Ms. Rubin writes her a*s off: one can always be assured that she has a fresh column.) Geoffrey Skelley of FiveThirtyEight notes how ultra-partisanship is responsible for holding down President Biden’s approval ratings (which are pretty good) Unlike many past presidents Biden has not really enjoyed a “honeymoon” period despite having signed a popular COVID-19 relief bill and receiving positive marks from the public on his handling of the coronavirus crisis more generally. At the moment his job approval rating sits at about 54 percent according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker. And while that’s notably higher than Donald Trump’s 42 percent approval rating on his 100th day as president Biden’s approval is still lower than any other newly elected president’s going back to Dwight Eisenhower’s in 1953 according to FiveThirtyEight’s historical presidential approval data. Why is Biden’s overall approval rating comparatively low if Americans are giving him such high marks for how he’s handled the pandemic? This is in large part thanks to how polarized our politics are. The honeymoon period has diminished given just how hard it is for presidents to attract support from outside their party base. Take Biden. His approval rating has the largest gap between Democrats and Republicans in Gallup’s presidential approval polling over the first 100 days of any recent president as the table below shows. Thomas Wright of The Atlantic explains how President Biden’s plan for vaccine diplomacy blew up as a result of the crisis in India President Joe Biden’s foreign-policy team supports India and is unambiguously internationalist in its instincts especially on matters of public health. It was horrified by the Trump administration’s failure to lead a global response in the early stages of the pandemic. However key elements of Biden’s domestic-policy team including his political advisers and the coronavirus task force favored achieving herd immunity in the United States before sending vaccines or related materials overseas. It wanted to demonstrate to the American people that they were laser-focused on fighting the pandemic at home. The administration settled on a policy to reconcile these different impulses. It would keep Donald Trump’s executive orders preventing exports of vaccines and related raw materials but once the domestic vaccination program was largely complete it would pivot to play a global leadership role in the pandemic. All going according to plan this moment would come before the G7 summit in the United Kingdom on June 11 which would allow the president to act boldly with other world leaders. The U.S.’s initial protectionism would likely then be quickly forgotten. In early April Secretary of State Antony Blinken appointed Gayle Smith a highly respected former administrator of USAID to head up the administration’s vaccine-diplomacy efforts. Biden also announced the Quad Vaccine Partnership which promised to finance manufacture and deliver 1 billion vaccines for the Indo-Pacific region by the end of 2022. The production would be centered in India. Trudy Rubin of the Philadelphia Inquirer grades President Biden on foreign policy. The country can be grateful that from the get-go Biden restored sanity and professionalism to the foreign policy-making process. Biden has been tougher than President Barack Obama — and light-years more savvy and strategic than the erratic tweeter who made foreign policy in 280-word bursts. In Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and their deputies the White House opted for deep experience and expertise (although many key posts are still unfilled). This is a team that will work together on policy unlike the chaos of the previous White House where the president made war on intelligence agencies and fired top national security officials like a reality TV host. Nothing so exemplified Donald Trump’s lack of strategic thinking than his disdain for NATO and insults to key European and Asian leaders. It will be hard to rebuild trust and there is still discord on China policy. But without tight coordination with allied democracies –— including the new “Quad” grouping of India Japan Australia and the United States — America cannot push back against China’s unfair trade policies or its efforts to set new authoritarian rules for the world. Dahleen Glanton of the Chicago Tribune explains something that many seem not to be able to grasp: Black Americans do not hate the police.  At all. I can’t speak for those who clash with police officers on the streets but some African Americans struggle at times to balance their anger over the senseless police shootings with compassion for some of the officers. Contrary to the popular narrative most Black people don’t hate the police. We just want them to treat us with the same humanity as others. Producer Tyler Perry addressed that stereotypical notion Sunday night while accepting the humanitarian award during the Academy Awards show. “I refuse to hate someone because they are a police officer” he said urging people to not make blanket judgments and to stand against hatred in any form. Perry failed to note a very important distinction though. It’s possible to hate a police officer’s behavior and not actually hate the person. That’s what Ellison was talking about Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes.” Renée Graham of Boston Globe thinks that the International Olympic Committee has it all the way wrong for banning any sort of athlete political protest or commentary at this summer’s Olympic Games. ...Earlier this month the International Olympic Committee voted to uphold a rule that prohibits any kind of “demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda” in Olympic venues and areas. This is the IOC’s pointed small-minded response to a worldwide movement energized last year after a white Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd one that continues with still more police killings. By banning athletes from wearing anything that says Black Lives Matter — or presumably “Stop Asian Hate” or “Protect Trans Lives” — they want to inoculate the Games from reality. They are demanding that Olympians check their consciences at the door as if white supremacy systemic racism and police violence also will pause for those two weeks during the Olympics. This means athletes cannot raise a fist during the national anthem as American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos did on the winners’ podium at the Mexico City Games in 1968. They cannot take a knee like NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other athletes during the pre-game anthem in 2016. They cannot don Black Lives Matters T-shirts as players in the four major sports in the United States did last season. Vikas Dandekar writes for STATnews about the COVID-19 crisis in India. In cities big and small hospitals are too full to accept new patients and diagnostic centers take up to three days or more to do chest scans of those who might have Covid-19. Doctors and hospital staff are completely exhausted. Social media is flooded with passionate pleas for oxygen cylinders and concentrators. WhatsApp groups are filled with messages as friends and families scramble to access oxygen remdesivir tocilizumab steroids and other therapies. In a country where drug regulatory oversight is suspect indiscriminate sale of fake drugs is a huge problem. As someone who has covered the pharmaceutical and health care industries for more than two decades I get calls for help into the wee hours of the night from family members friends and even acquaintances. Fake therapies are something I constantly worry about as I try to use my contacts to help people looking for hospital beds medicines or oxygen cylinders. Sometimes I’ve been able to help but the calls are so many and the problems so big that often I cannot. The merciless spread of Covid-19 is driving families to extreme limits. People with the means to do so are shelling out on the black market as much as 10 times the cost of a single vial of remdesivir. Others many of whom are being pushed to bankruptcy resign themselves to destiny. Farokh E. Udwadia writes for Indian Express about the continuing COVID-19 crisis in India. (I want to note for the record that it seems that much of the press outside of/not based in India seems far more focused on what the international community needs to do for India.  The press based in and actually reporting out of India (and especially the Indian press) seems more focused on what happened in India itself and where PM Modi’s failures were and are. Both perspectives are important.) As the virus is tearing through our country we witness election rallies where thousands of people day after day standing shoulder to shoulder without masks listen to our netas without masks spitting out words (and perhaps some coronaviruses) for over an hour. More infections more misery. Also note the poor planning of the vaccination programme. Is it not elementary that the supply of the vaccine should relate to the demand? If indeed this were so why is there a shortage of vaccines in many vaccination centres with long queues of people waiting in the hot sun — more spread of infections greater misery. Again how large-hearted we all are! What largesse we possess to give vaccines to neighbouring countries forgetting the agony of people in our own country forgetting that charity begins at home. What indeed should we do now? As one who has treated many ill patients over many years let me give the following suggestions. First treatment. Beg borrow steal pay even a ransom to get more oxygen transport it and make it available to patients. This requires excellent logistic planning. We are fighting a war and no war has ever been won without excellent logistic support. Everyone have a great day!
