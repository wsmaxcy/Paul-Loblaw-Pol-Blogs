L, PWB Peeps: Toosdai Evening: Moar computter problems edition, elenacarlenaforPWB Peeps, 2021-04-27, Welp again the computter and/or DKos is not cooperating this evening. So we will do another quickie. We did A-D last week with E in the Comments so let’s proceed!  F is for fowl:  G is for guinea pigs:  H is for hedgehogs:  And I is for iguana:  And so we begin and end with puns. Sorry not sorry. This is an Open Thread. Hopefully the computter will behave now. Get yer Comments get yer Comments here early in case I get thrown out again!
