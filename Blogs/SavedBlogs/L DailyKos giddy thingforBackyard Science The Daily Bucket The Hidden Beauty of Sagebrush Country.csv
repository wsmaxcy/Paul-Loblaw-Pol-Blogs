L, The Daily Bucket: The Hidden Beauty of Sagebrush Country, giddy thingforBackyard Science, 2021-04-28,  The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge. We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns around us. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below.  Include photos if possible!  We love photos!  Most of my adult life and wildlife career were spent in the sagebrush country of California Oregon and Idaho. As I wrote over a decade ago for a conservation newsletter sagebrush country is a “landscape of paradox.”  Seemingly boundless and forbidding as the open ocean it is a country of rich complexity and stark beauty of intense cold and heat of drought and blizzard still as a fencepost — yet fast as a pronghorn. It is an immense landscape spanning more than 155 million acres of the intermountain west yet it is one of the most threatened ecosystems in North America.         Idaho Fish and Game News November 2008  Sagebrush country suffers a bit from an image problem. For some that haven’t experienced it the vast sea of sage-scrub is considered an  uninhabitable wasteland. For long-haul drivers crossing Nevada or Wyoming sagebrush can seem like an endless monotonous drab-gray landscape. And not that long ago sagebrush was often regarded as a nuisance weed to eradicate and replace with livestock forage.   These long-standing perceptions are simply nonsense. The sagebrush sea contains astonishing beauty complexity and diversity if one takes the time to look. This massive biome supports over 350 vertebrate species 1000+ invertebrate species and as many as 5000 vascular plant taxa.  Yet the sagebrush biome is one of the most imperiled in the U.S. from 160+ years of human use resulting in degradation loss and fragmentation. Sagebrush ecology and management are such massively complex topics it would take 100 Buckets (much less one!) to scratch the surface. I’ve added a few links below for deeper reading. But today I simply wish to celebrate the flora & fauna of sagebrush country and give you a glimpse of its enigmatic beauty.        One of the most iconic symbols of sagebrush country is the Greater Sage-grouse. Because this largest of North American grouse is dependent on sagebrush in every stage of its life cycle the sage-grouse is referred to as an “umbrella species.” In conserving the large landscapes sage-grouse need for survival many other wildlife species stand to benefit under the umbrella.   Under the sage-grouse “umbrella” are several species considered to be “sagebrush obligates” —  meaning they’re dependent on sagebrush for survival. In addition to Pronghorn and Greater Sage-grouse these species include Pygmy Rabbit Sage Thrasher Sage Sparrow Brewer’s Sparrow and Common Sagebrush Lizard.        Here are a few more photos of the remarkable array of plants and animals I’ve encountered while working and recreating in sagebrush county:              For further reading: North American Sagebrush Steppe  USGS Sagebrush  Biden’s 30 x 30 Plan: A Roadmap to Restore the Sagebrush Steppe
