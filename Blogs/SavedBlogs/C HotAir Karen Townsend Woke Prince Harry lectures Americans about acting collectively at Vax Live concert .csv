C, Woke Prince Harry lectures Americans about acting "collectively" at Vax Live concert , Karen Townsend, 2021-05-03, Los Angeles loves Harry. Prince Harry a.k.a. Duke of Sussex was a featured celebrity of Global Citizen’s VAX Live: The Concert to Reunite the World. The event was taped Sunday at the SoFi Stadium. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle served as co-chairs of the concert meant to emphasize the need for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The special concert was recorded on Sunday May 2 at the new SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. It will be televised next Saturday May 8. It was a bit surreal to read Harry’s remarks. They were a lecture in support of collectivism as it turns out. His remarks are sprinkled with the word “collectively” which conjure up thoughts of Stalin and Marx intentionally or not. He thanked frontline workers and he applauded them for getting vaccinated to help end the pandemic.  “Hi everybody. We are at a defining moment in the global fight against COVID-19. Tonight is a celebration of each of you here the vaccinated frontline workers in the audience and the millions of frontline heroes around the world” he said in his address. “You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all. You served and sacrificed put yourselves in harm’s way and with bravery knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible depth of gratitude thank you. The Duke of Sussex addressed audiences onstage. “We are at a defining moment in the global fight against COVID-19. Tonight is a celebration of each of you here the vaccinated frontline workers in the audience and the millions of frontline heroes around the world” Prince Harry praised the crowd before calling for equal vaccine distribution on a global scale. “This pandemic cannot end unless we act collectively with an unprecedented commitment to our shared humanity.”  Harry continued with grand language about lifting up all of humanity.  The vaccine must be distributed to everyone everywhere. We cannot rest or truly recover until there is fair distribution to every corner of the world. The mission in front of us is one we cannot afford to fail out and that’s what tonight is about. The virus does not respect borders and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography. It must be accepted as a basic right for all and that is our starting point” Harry continued. “None of us should be comfortable thinking that we could be fine when so many others are suffering. In reality and especially with this pandemic when any suffer we all suffer. We must look beyond ourselves with empathy and compassion for those we know and those we don’t. We need to lift up all of humanity and make sure that no person or community is left behind. What we do in this moment will stand in history and tonight we stand in solidarity with the millions of families across India who are battling a devastating second wave” he concluded. The irony of Harry’s call for global collectivism in getting the world’s population vaccinated is that Harry himself would have made a bad New Soviet man as envisioned by Stalin and Marx. Their idea was that Soviet citizens must be willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of the collective. Woke Harry wasn’t even willing to sacrifice his desire to live large in southern California for the sake of the Royal Family. He lectures others to fall in line and work for the greater good while he is famously self-centered.  The concert was hosted by Selena Gomez with special performances by Jennifer Lopez Foo Fighters and others. Harry was a featured celebrity guest. The purpose of the concert was to spotlight the need to get the COVID-19 vaccines distributed around the world. It looks very “We Are the World”. The problem is that we know that “we” are not all in this pandemic together. From the beginning there have been stories of celebrities and wealthy people including politicians behaving differently than what they requested of others. Then when the vaccines became available they jumped the line. The workers in the entertainment industry were categorized as essential workers so that they could continue working while millions of regular people were unemployed due to pandemic restraints. The people who need to hear messages of encouragement to think of others were the very people on the stage including Prince Harry.  Poor Harry just seems confused. He wants to cash in on being a member of the Royal Family yet he wants to live the life of a celebrity in southern California. Let’s be honest he wouldn’t be courted as he is without the royal title. There is a piece in the Washington Post that accurately depicts Harry and Meghan’s thirst for the life of the Obamas or Oprah. The Obamas cashed in their years in politics with multi-million dollar deals with Netflix and book publishing deals. Harry and Meghan are doing the same by moving to Oprah’s neighborhood and living large while “reinventing themselves as multihyphenate American celebrities the kind who dabble in content philanthropy technology and a tasteful dash of politics.” Harry recently accepted a position with a Silicon Valley start-up. Harry is everywhere following the path of others who seek fame and fortune. In this case Global Citizen was happy to oblige.  Well he’s here! Los Angeles LOVES Prince Harry tonight — he gets electric reception and standing ovation as he steps out on the biggest stage since moving down the road in Montecito. #VaxLive pic.twitter.com/ewzqZ7WnYz — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) May 3 2021
