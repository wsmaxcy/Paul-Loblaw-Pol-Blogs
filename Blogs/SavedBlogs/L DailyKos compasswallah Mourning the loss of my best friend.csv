L, Mourning the loss of my best friend, compasswallah, 2021-04-28,   I first met Craig in junior high school. He was the younger brother of a classmate and two grades behind us. I would never be more than casual friends with his brother. But me and Craig would form a bond that would last nearly forty years.   I hadn’t really gotten to know him well until we shared a class together my junior year. And it was in shop class back when they had such things that we would learn to weld together then to work on cars together. And it would be this love of machines and wrenching on them that would hold us together for so many years.    I wouldn’t get my first car until the middle of senior year. And when I had saved up six hundred dollars I bought a crappy Chevy Vega. Craig one year my junior and a year before he could get a driver's license was able to buy and hide from his parents a ‘69 Chevy Chevelle.    After my graduation I had little direction in life and even less motivation to find any. I worked as a mechanic in a bike shop and rode my mountain bike everywhere. I smoked a ton of pot and drank a lot of beer when I could find it. Me and Craig found common interest here as well. Craig never failed in finding beer. Whether by driving forty miles to a little bodega in another city that never carded us or getting this really sketchy looking guy everyone called Jaybird to buy it. Craig always came through.   By the time Craig graduated my dad was pushing me to find that direction I lacked. Not knowing what else to do I did the easiest thing I could. I let myself be recruited into the Marine Corps. They would be training me as a technician in a high tech aviation field. I joined as a reservist though still not ready to fully commit to anything. Craig and his brother and most of our auto shop friends would leave soon for Arizona where two of the largest auto tech schools are. Those schools always had recruiters at our high school as did the military. So all of us directionless mechanical types would most likely be going to one or the other.    I returned home after training in San Diego and North Carolina and began drilling at a nearby base and looking for a job. My high tech training would prove nearly useless in the civilian world. But that haircut and military diploma would end up getting me a job in a fairly low tech industry  servicing machinery with a large company. Craig returned from Arizona not too long after and found a job as a mechanic. It took a little while for me and Craig to reconnect after not hearing from each other for two years. But we were soon back doing things together and dreaming of the future. This would be the start to a pattern that would last for years this drifting apart and coming back together. But somehow for almost forty years we always reconnected and restarted our friendship.    The pot was now a thing of the past for both of us with Craig by choice and me by force. But at least now we didn’t need to find anyone to buy us beer. Our new shared passions were besides  beer and girls of course; four-wheeling and shooting guns. I had a Toyota Land Cruiser and Craig a Jeep CJ-5. The frustrating thing was there was no place to do either within 80 miles. Now there was ample open space and water district lands full of fire roads just temping us so soon we were driving these roads at night always alert for the minimal law enforcement presence in these parts. Fortunately we were smart enough to leave the guns at home the noise would get us busted for sure. My father was a cop and I grew up camping and shooting in the woods. And though no one would call our hometown rural there were many of our friends that shared the same interests.   Except for gun control we never talked politics back then and I doubt either of us knew anything about it both of us having a general disregard for both politics and politicians. He never seemed that conservative though. He listened to NPR and voted Democratic he supported a woman’s right to choose and he believed in gun rights too. He didn’t feel the need to pick a team and take orders from them; he made his choices individually.    I would soon leave for another state while Craig stayed in our hometown. We kept in touch by phone then talking for hours sometimes but it would be five years until I saw him again. In this time span we both found new directions in life. I traded in my wrenches for a chef's knife and Craig his for a sewing machine. We had both found something that interested us more than mechanics for me it was cooking and for Craig auto upholstery. As we got older there would be more direction changes in our lives. At one point we were working at the same shop driving tow trucks. Eventually Craig would end up with a class A truck driver’s licence and a union job and me a Bachelor of Science degree and a government job.    You know it was the talking we enjoyed so much and we had conversations that wandered all over the place and we seemed to think so much alike. We did literally finish each other's sentences. Sometimes I would have a thought fairly off the subject and before I could open my mouth he’d bring it up. I thought he could read my mind sometimes. And it didn’t seem there was any subject we couldn’t talk about. Though I’m pretty sure politics never came up. Craig was incredibly sharp; he picked things up so fast. And he had a lot of what I would call common sense. And this kind of common sense is definitely an uncommon virtue. We learned from each other all the time.    How he came by all his knowledge I’ll never know. Craig wasn’t a reader. I never knew him to read for pleasure and when he read out of necessity it was slow and strained. He had been diagnosed in high school if you can believe it with dyslexia. Why this wasn’t caught sooner I’ll never know. I was reading before I started school thanks to my mother.    When he talked about a subject you could tell he understood it. He never talked out of his ass about things he didn’t know unlike so many people I have met. Whether he was telling you about jet-boat impellers or World War II military vehicles his depth of knowledge was so great you had no reason to doubt him.   I know it will be our conversations that I’ll miss the most. Lately those conversations have been more reminiscing than dreaming of the future. But these are important too. All of my family is gone now and there is no one left on earth with as much shared history with me as Craig.     I don’t know when the cancer entered his brain. He has always been intensely private about some aspects of his life. But it didn’t matter we have been there for each other many times. I know no one will ever know the true cause of that cancer either but I kid him that it’s from watching too much YouTube.    He had been showing symptoms for a little while and I started noticing more and more. His conversations would slip into what I think of as fantasy. He would be saying things that made no sense sometimes. He would get very agitated and rail endlessly about perceived persecution and blame people who weren’t there. He seemed to be becoming paranoid and much angrier than I had ever known him to be. I was finding it harder and harder to listen to him. I found that by carefully avoiding certain subjects we could still talk. But now it was nothing but reminiscing.   Perhaps due to my inattention during our last conversation the subject of Jan. 6 came up and I listened with shock and disbelief to him telling me that no police had been injured and the one who died died from something else. Also the video of police being beaten and dragged down the steps were fake. I told him all that fake video would put the moon landing hoax to shame. And then we agreed to never talk politics again.    Craig hopefully will be around for a long time with cancer just a metaphor. But Truth is dead and I am in mourning.
