L, What are the odds of Facebook Oversight Board letting previous guy back on Wednesday, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-05-03, Likely Trump will continue to be banned from Facebook but just in case it is worth speculating what would happen if he returns. His generalÂ laying-low these days is probably in hopes of getting a reprieve. Facebookâ€™s oversight board will announce its ruling on whether former President Donald Trumpâ€™s account should be reinstated or remain suspended on Wednesday morning the group said. An imminent decision on a blockbuster case:Â The ruling which Facebook has said will be binding could usher in Trumpâ€™s return to the worldâ€™s biggest social network â€” or cut him off permanently from yet another major online platform. It will also mark the highest-profile test to date for the board which has overturned a series of Facebookâ€™s decisions but not yet ruled on a case of this magnitude. How we got here:Â The company suspended Trump from Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram on Jan. 7 one day after his supporters stormed the Capitol in an attack organized across numerous platforms. Facebook said at the time his account posed risk of inciting more violence. Trumpâ€™s social media exile took hold later that month after Twitter permanently booted him from his signature platform and Google-owned YouTube suspended him indefinitely effectively stripping him of his ability to engage directly with millions of followers online. Status update:Â While Trump was banned for good from Twitter Facebook and YouTube have left open the possibility of his return. Facebook on Jan. 21 referred Trumpâ€™s suspension to its oversight board which then had 90 days to come to a decision on the case. YouTube CEO Susan WojcickiÂ has said Trumpâ€™s account will be reinstatedÂ once the risk for violence subsides. www.politico.com/...
