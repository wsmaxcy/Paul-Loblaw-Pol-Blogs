L, Buh Bye!  Meghan McCain Leaving 'The View' , Frances Langum, 2021-07-01, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  OF COURSE Meghan McCain took the opportunity today to talk about herself for eight minutes straight.   .@MeghanMcCain announces her departure from @TheView at the end of the show‚Äôs season saying ‚Äúthis was not an easy decision.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm just eternally grateful to have had this opportunity here so seriously thank you from the absolute bottom of my heart.‚Äù https://t.co/ZiP1UTs2xu pic.twitter.com/eLuEAJ4KLT ‚Äî The View (@TheView) July 1 2021 As I noted a couple of weeks ago Twitter was constantly reacting to the latest nonsense to come out of Meghan's mouth with calls for her to be fired.  I disagreed: Sorry spats between Meghan and the rest of The View?  That's the FORMAT of the SHOW.  Calling for Meghan to be fired?  Pointless.  The show is trending and that's the point. pic.twitter.com/jxFgvYIGmI ‚Äî Frances Langum üß∂ (@bluegal) June 17 2021 But regardless of whether this was a "deeply personal decision based on the needs of her young family yadda yadda" or a mutual separation based on suits upstairs plus Whoopi being tired of her BS she's leaving.  And her hopes of getting back on FOX will be delayed for at least a bit.   And "her BS" wasn't that she was a conservative on a panel of liberals.  Meghan McCain consistently prefaced her "conservative viewpoint" comments with an entire paragraph about her personal history.  It was her very conscious technique for grabbing camera time without content.  That habit was not supportive of her co-hosts or of the "hot topics" format of the show.   My personal favorite example of Meghan's narcissism is her interview with Rachel Maddow from 2019:  As I wrote then: It's almost painful to watch the great interviewer Rachel Maddow get interviewed by one of the worst interviewers on television Meghan McCain. Observe how Meghan breaks an essential rule of interviewing and makes her first question in this clip all about herself. (Points off for not mentioning "my father." ) Rachel Maddow is a genuinely kind person to a fault. I would have interrupted and asked Meghan about her dinner last night what she wore to bed you know really put me in the SCENE where you were thinking about what you wanted to ask me Meghan because the way you paint your thought process it's just so farking fascinating. It appears it may have been a ratings issue after all?  Oops! *giggle* cc:@meghanmccain pic.twitter.com/mtUS7gVR4G ‚Äî chris evans (@chris_notcapn) July 1 2021 But if Meghan McCain leaves the view how will we ever know who her father was? ‚Äî The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) July 1 2021 People didn't dislike you because you were conservative. They dislike you because you were rude disrespectful pouted and angry when a cohost or guest did not agree with you. ‚Äî This Too Shall Pass (@LApurpleiris) July 1 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
