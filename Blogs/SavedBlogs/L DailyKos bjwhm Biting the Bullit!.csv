L, Biting the Bullit!, bjwhm, 2021-04-20, A voice in America THERE HAVE BEEN 157 MASS SHOOTING AS OF TODAY IN 2021 per CNN. 2020 sets a record for U.S. gun sales. More gun background checks (a proxy for sales) have been conducted in the first 10 months of 2020 than ever before.  Source: National Shooting Sports Foundation. According to CBS News:  The National Shooting Sports Foundation found that 17.2 million background checks were completed this year versus 15.7 million in 2016 the previous high-water mark for gun sales. Firearm purchases have climbed every month since March and more than 1.7 million background checks were conducted in October alone a roughly 60% jump over the same period in 2019.Many years ago I worked for Smith & Wesson.  I mainly sold handguns long guns CS and CN teargas throughout the world.  I have nothing against guns for sport or personal protection in your home.  I believe in competitive sport shooting hunting and target practice.   However I agree with President Biden that the USA is suffering from an epidemic of violence by guns.  I respect the Second Amendment to the US Constitution but let us look at the intent and entirety of that amendment: Second Amendment:   A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause (“A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State”) and its operative clause (“the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed”). In other words people have the right to bear arms however this was in deference to the fact that the thirteen colonies that comprised the US could not afford to have a standing army.  Therefore it was necessary to have a standing volunteer militia.  We no longer have the need for a standing militia (The National Guard has taken care of that). But we still have the right to bear reasonable arms for self-protection hunting and sport shooting. With federally regulated gun permits hunting licenses and sport shooting licenses we can limit the use of bullets sold per weapon.  Gun owners would have sufficient ammunition for their purpose. But there would be limited bullet and magazine capacity.  Stringent background checks and state-regulated weapon safety training would be mandatory before owning a license to carry or own a weapon.   I believe that we could limit the number of firearms per person to five (5) handguns and/or rifles per licensed individual. I would prefer to limit hunting rifles to bolt action rifles.  It is a sporting activity and a single-shot rifle would certainly more challenging than spraying the woods with an assault rifle to kill a deer.  (It could also ruin the deer meat).  There is actually no reason to possess a military-style assault weapon with multiple magazines 30 rounds in each magazine.  That is a killing machine. If we look at John Donne’s immortal poem.  We can see that no man or incident can be isolated.  One action affects us all.  Each life is precious for its contributions and mankind is the lesser for its loss. No man is an islandEntire of itselfEvery man is a piece of the continentA part of the main.If a clod be washed away by the seaEurope is the less.As well as if a promontory were.As well as if a manor of thy friend'sOr of thine own were:Any man's death diminishes meBecause I am involved in mankindAnd therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;It tolls for thee.John Donne   Gun Violence in the United States: examples.

Before joining The Times she covered British politics for The Wall Street Journal. @jggross This file was updated on April 16 after the shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis.The bleak reality of a list like this is that it leaves out so many more. There have been dozens of mass shootings in the United States in just the past five years according to the Violence Project which maintains a database of attacks in which at least four people were killed. And before that many more were seared into memories: San Bernardino Calif. and Charleston S.C. in 2015; Newtown Conn. and Aurora Colo. in 2012; Virginia Tech in 2007 among them.Each new attack is a reminder of all of the others that came before it as the nation has been unable to curb an epidemic of gun violence that far outpaces other countries. These are just some of the horrors that have traumatized the nation. April 15 2021: A FedEx warehouse in IndianapolisAt least eight people were killed not including a gunman who was believed to have taken his own life after opening fire in the warehouse.

It was the country’s first mass shooting to command nationwide attention in a year and caused particular alarm among many Asian-Americans.A Rise in Anti-Asian AttacksA torrent of hate and violence against people of Asian descent around the United States began last spring in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.Background: Community leaders say the bigotry was fueled by President Donald J. Trump who frequently used racist language like “Chinese virus” to refer to the coronavirus.Data: The New York Times using media reports from across the country to capture a sense of the rising tide of anti-Asian bias found more than 110 episodes since March 2020 in which there was clear evidence of race-based hate.Underreported Hate Crimes: The tally may be only a sliver of the violence and harassment given the general undercounting of hate crimes but the broad survey captures the episodes of violence across the country that grew in number amid Mr. Trump's comments.In New York: A wave of xenophobia and violence has been compounded by the economic fallout of the pandemic which has dealt a severe blow to New York’s Asian-American communities. Many community leaders say racist assaults are being overlooked by the authorities.What Happened in Atlanta: Eight people including six women of Asian descent were killed in shootings at massage parlors in Atlanta on March 16. The motives of the suspect who has been charged with murder are under investigation but Asian communities across the United States are on alert because of a surge in attacks against Asian-Americans over the past year.
