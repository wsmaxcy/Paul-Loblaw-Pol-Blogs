Starting off in the Bistro Cafe political and national security experts agree that the United States has entered a “neo-fascist era in American politics.”  Then on the rest of the menu Census takers worry that apartment renters were undercounted; after stripping federal protections in the waning days of his administration Trump unleashed an “outright slaughter” of wolves in Wisconsin; and far-right extremist militias like the Three Percenters have infiltrated local governments and the locals are not happy.  After the break we move to the Chef’s Table where the Honduran mastermind behind the 2016 killing of prize-winning environmental and Indigenous rights defender Berta Cáceres has finally been convicted; and renowned winemaker Moet-Hennessy is suspending champagne shipments to Russia after a law was adopted that allows the term to be used only for “Russian champagne.”   All that and more on West Coast Cookbook & Speakeasy with Chef de Cuisine Justice Putnam.

Yes those are the Ones.    -- JP ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     — Aimee Nezhukumatathil  “Sea Church” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Rest in Peace Aaron Swartz ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
