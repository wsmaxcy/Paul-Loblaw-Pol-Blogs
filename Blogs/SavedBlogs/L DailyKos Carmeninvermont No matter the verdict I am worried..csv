L, No matter the verdict I am worried., Carmeninvermont, 2021-04-18, I have been contemplating  this  for several days. The closer we get to verdict time for Chauvin the more I see worry from the news casters as well. There seems to be many paths. And even writing and posting this makes me fret. Please stay with me.  So three charges and probably both sides resting tomorrow. Jury deliberation and then…  Let’s say hung jury with one or more jury members with enough doubt or not enough morality.  Regardless of another prosecution maybe or maybe not I assume that most others  would also assume protests would ensue. And validly so. Not valid violence obviously but maybe that too.  Other possible path(s). One or two or all three charges full 12 votes for guilty. Ok. But then shitty sentencing. Anything from time served to probation to mere months in prison. I again would assume valid protests and perhaps violence here also.  But then…All three charges full on guilty and sentencing full on as much as possible in Minnesota. Life in prison. OK. Joy? Hell yes!  But after January 6 does  the new normal get us  protests from THEM here also? I do admit to finding it difficult to imagine the form of protests/violence from the Chauvin supporters but then I think that seems like a racist/prejudiced  position. So I wonder.  I do not want to offer a poll here because the possible answers make me cringe even more. I guess my bottom line is that we or I have a “normal” assumption of protests and violence if Chauvin does not get what is coming to him. The TV talking heads seem to be there too. Should we or I  maybe start to think about the opposite?  And if so where does that leave us? I am mentally stuck here and will appreciate further thoughts from people smarter than me.  Stay Safe
