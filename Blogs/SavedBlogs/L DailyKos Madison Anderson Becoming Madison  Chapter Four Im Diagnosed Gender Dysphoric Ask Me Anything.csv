L, Becoming Madison:  Chapter Four I'm Diagnosed Gender Dysphoric Ask Me Anything, Madison Anderson, 2021-05-01,  I’m going to segue a bit here from the current narrative.  I know all dozen odd of you who actually follow my natterings have been biting their nails wondering how our Plucky Trans Heroine got on with her life after her fiancée broke their engagement.Oh I’ll post more about that.  Things are working out but life is a perpetual work in progress right?  But in the meantime what with all the anti-transgender legislation being proposed and tragically passed we’ve seen a few diaries about the transgender experience.  There seems to be some confusion about what gender dysphoria actually is.  It’s not displaying non-gender conforming behavior or being gay.  It’s not necessarily cross dressing.  Some people just cross dress because they enjoy it not because they think of themselves as the opposite gender. Side note: I don’t want to paint all the diaries on dysphoria with the same brush here.  For example This Diary by BoiseBlue was extremely touching and trans supportive.  So if none of those things are Gender Dysphoria what on Earth is it?  At its most basic Gender Dysphoria is a disconnect between your gender and your sex assigned at birth.  That’s the textbook definition.  But what does that mean?  I don’t try to speak for everyone who identifies as transgender.  I can however speak for myself.  I have spent almost five decades dealing with dysphoria. For the record I am actually diagnosed with dysphoria.  My therapist sat down with me over several sessions going through the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) criteria and oh boy.  Basically I blew the criteria off the proverbial rails.  It’s been persistent throughout my life.  My reasons for not coming out for so long were social and practical not any wavering of my gender identity.I have a female brain.  To quote Jessica Rabbit I’m just drawn that way.  Current research on neuronal activity backs up my own experiences.  Transgender people have brains that work like those of their identified gender. As the WPATH criteria notes Gender Non-Conformity and Gender Dysphoria are two different things.  In Episode Two Childhood I talked about my youthful cross dressing the obligatory going to bed every night praying that I’d wake up a girl the desire to hang out with the girls and do girl things all that.  To quote my kid sister when I came out to her “And here I thought you always played with me and my dolls because you were being a nice brother!”  These are all pretty typical “growing up trans” stories but telling them can create the illusion of dysphoria being defined by episodes of non-conformity or occasional youthful curiosity about what the other side of the gender fence is like.It’s not that at all.  It’s persistent.  Oh you can lead an outwardly cis life even be happy.  I didn’t have a bad life prior to coming out.  But I always wished I was outwardly female.  I’d constantly fantasize about mundane things like imagining that I was a woman doing the exact thing I was currently doing.  Seriously incredibly boring stuff like housework commuting to work walking my dog whatever.  My late wife and I went to Paris and I wrote a travel diary—but all from the perspective of a woman my age on vacation with her husband.Um.  This is embarrassing but it extended to intimacy too.  My fiancée had to ask the uncomfortable question: “So when we...do you sometimes fantasize that you’re a woman?”“A bit yeah.” “How often?” “Every time.” Dysphoria is not just a “Gosh it’d be nice” sort of thing either at least not for me.  We can look at the tragic case of David Reimer who was given feminization surgery as a baby following a botched circumcision.  Despite constant “therapy” encouraging him to act like a girl and even hormones he never felt that he was female.  He had a boy’s brain and no amount of conditioning and socialization was going to change that.  He rebelled and transitioned back at age 15 but the psychological effects were terrible.  He committed suicide in 2004.  Reimer’s experience is pretty much every transgender person’s experience.  We might not have an unscrupulous psychologist trying to condition us to act like the opposite gender but we’ve got social pressure if nothing else.  And a lot of us myself included try to “fix” ourselves by acting like what we imagine the other gender should be like.I had an abusive father.  He’d do things like throw his wimpy “son” down the stairs.  I joined the wrestling team late in high school.  I got strong.  I still remember the day he grabbed me from behind in the kitchen.  I flipped him hard on his back.  He left me alone after that.I’m proud of that moment.  But I was still transgender.I signed up for Naval ROTC and joined the pistol/rifle team and drill team.  I roomed with macho marines and tried to fit in (spoiler:  I didn’t).  I got awarded flight school and went on to fly jets off carriers.I love planes.  But I was still transgender.I married a beautiful brilliant and talented woman and stayed married for two decades until the day came when I clicked the switch off on her oxygen.  I held her in my arms as she died.  She was my everything.We had the fairy tale marriage.  But I was still transgender.When I started trying to date again I had my testosterone checked.  As it turns out I’m hypogonadal.  My T levels are at the bottom end of the normal range at best.  So maybe that was it right?  I got a prescription and started taking testosterone. It only made me cranky and angry.  It felt foreign. I started “accidentally” skipping injections sometimes for a couple of weeks.   It didn’t “fix” me though. I was still transgender. Against all odds I met another woman who I became best buddies with and then fell in love with.  We got engaged and had a healthy romantic relationship.  I was still transgender. I thought I could avoid telling her.  Keeping the secret to myself almost destroyed our relationship.  It almost destroyed me. The only thing that fixed me was coming out and admitting who and what I was.  If there had been ANYTHING I could have done to flip a switch and make me a normal cis male I would have done it.  I put everything on the line when I came out--  I was sure my fiancée was going to leave me.  I’ve learned that being dysphoric is no longer a grounding diagnosis per the FAA but I honestly didn’t know that at the time.  I had no idea how long I might be booted from the cockpit and my dream job of flying.I’ve had a relatively easy coming out but the road ahead is not going to be easy.  Transitioning is incredibly hard both physically and socially.  The absolutely only reason anyone would do it is because the alternative is worse.  I tried for so long to not be transgender or at least to hide it.  And it nearly broke me.When I stopped taking the testosterone supplements I remember the feeling of peace that settled on me as the effects wore off.  Today I’m sitting here in my girl pajamas sipping my morning coffee and typing away.  I’m on my second day hormones but this time the right ones. I realize intellectually that the first effects will be weeks away.  But once again I feel peaceful and content in a way that I’ve never felt before.The only “fix” for dysphoria is honesty.  Not everyone’s answer is my answer.   Full transition isn’t for everyone.  There are various degrees and methods for coming to terms with our gender identity and we all have different roads to tread.But you can’t change who you truly are.  Trying to change your soul is trying to destroy yourself.  Embrace your identity.  And let yourself live.I finally have.
