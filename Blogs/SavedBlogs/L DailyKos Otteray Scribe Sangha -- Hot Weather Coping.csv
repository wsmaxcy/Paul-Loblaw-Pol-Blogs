L, Sangha -- Hot Weather Coping, Otteray Scribe, 2021-06-27, Each of us has our own path; we come here by way of many different traditions and of no particular tradition. While the language we use may differ depending on the traditions teachers practices and teachings that have shaped our journeys we find in common generally a search for who we truly are our true nature and to bring the peace and compassion born of that search into the greater world of which we area part. If you wish to share or if you seek support or if you simply want to say hello please do as this space is for you. It it hot in parts of our world which have not seen this kind of weather since history was recorded.  Some escape the heat by artificial means such as air conditioning and fans. Other people seem to be better able to tolerate temperature extremes than others. It is important for us to be mindful of those who cannot escape and whose very lives are threatened. Stoic philosophers have advised us on dealing with adversity for centuries.  Here are a few of the more inspiring ones:    This winter video is atop the mighty Roan Mountain massif which sits on the NC/TN border.  The footpath seen at 0:32 is the Appalachian Trail. This mountain was considered sacred by the First People and for many later settlers such as myself it continues to hold sacred energy.  Roan Mountain is an especially sacred place for me personally. This is meant as a cooling meditation for midsummer heat. These visuals were not made in the worst part of winter but were made while snow was on the ground.  This brief time-lapse video was taken during deep winter on Roan Mountain.  Sunday Lagniappe: Cool Water was a hit song for the Sons of the Pioneers in 1947.  Among the founding members were Leonard Slye (Roy Rogers) and Ken Curtis (Festus on the Gunsmoke TV series). Cool Water was composed by group founder Bob Nolan.  Wishing everyone a restful day.  Please stay safe. Nemaste Peace this day and every day.  Take this time to sit and quietly take in your surroundings in a comfortable place.  Do not dwell on thoughts that enter your mind for long as the need to empty the mind while sitting is what is to be realized all the while concentrating on your breath:  Breath in and exhale out and truly realize the moment of this time that is just for you it is your place your time you are at home. This is an open thread. Please add your thoughts meditations and reflections as you wish.  *Attribution: Creator of Dkos Sangha Weekly Thread Brother “davehouck”.
