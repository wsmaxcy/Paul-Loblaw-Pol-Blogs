L, D’Souza's Imaginary Convo Between Climate-Denying “Peasants” headed to US and VP Harris, ClimateDenierRoundup, 2021-05-11, A week ago Vice President Kamala Harris gave a speech on immigration and mentioned climate change and extreme weather as some of the forces destabilizing the regions and pushing many people to flee North. The administration’s focus is (among other things) on “addressing both the acute factors and the root causes of migration” the Washington Times coverage quotes Harris saying one such issue is “the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience” in El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras where climate change by intensifying hurricanes for example is compounding problems like “drought and extreme food insecurity.”  Conservative media having stoked hatred for a certain type of immigrants (who don’t come from you know Sweden or Norway hint hint) were not particularly happy to learn their pet scapegoat is connected to the climate issue.  It had mostly blown over but then yesterday morning after having had nearly a week to put something together Dinseh D’Souza hit us with a “satirical sketch” in which he imagines what it would be like if VP Harris explained climate change to a peasant.   And that’s not our criticizing paraphrasing of this impressively cringey little video. While some might be embarrassed to admit that they had a week to put together a counter-argument and all they could come up with is imagining a conversation D’Souza doesn’t even do that well.  Because Harris’s laughing (supposedly but not actually in response to a question about the border) has become another misleading meme on the right essentially it’s just him doing an obnoxious impersonation of the Vice President as a ditz. But simple misogyny with a hint of racism is not enough for Dinesh’s audience so he balances that feeble performance with a stereotypical impersonation of the “peasant” (his word!) farmer he’s imagined half-heartedly affecting an accent so hackneyed you can sense his own discomfort at the bit wherein the imagined “peasant” has no idea about climate change or what “food insecurity” is revealing more about Dinesh’s perceptions of Central American people than anything else.  D’Souza a conspiracy-minded conservative “intellectual” whose father was a Johnson & Johnson executive is himself an immigrant from India. He came to the US as a high school foreign exchange student and went on to graduate from Darthmouth where his extra-cirriculars included using the student publication to out gay students. He grew up to work at some Koch groups before he became President of a small Christian school in 2010 before resigning in 2012 as the result of an alleged adultery scandal. 2012 was a big year for d’Souza because it’s also when he made some illegal political donations something he pled guilty to in 2014 and for which Trump pardoned him in 2018. (And that’s just a recap of the intro section to his Wikipedia page!)  So one would think that as a pardoned felon and naturalized citizen to the US D’Souza would be a little more sympathetic to people seeking a fresh start here. But that’s not really D’Souza’s brand.  Instead he somehow uses the fact that human suffering oppression and poverty has been around “for millennia” to argue that droughts and hurricanes wiping out crops year after year aren’t leaving people without food access. He tries to use India as a retort to the idea that poverty is driven by capitalism or other structural issues he only alludes to by saying that there have been slums there for thousands of years. Since we’re imagining things instead of watching his "sketch" you can just pretend he said "well there are poor people in India too so clearly climate isn't hurting the ignorant peasants in Central America” since that’s essentially the point he’s making.   But hand-waving mentions of the deeply ingrained problems of systemic oppression in India does nothing to rebut the reality which is that climate change is absolutely making things worse both in Central America and in India. It seems like D'Souza needs to do some more research and maybe talk to some of the “peasants” he uses as rhetorical props so they can give him a few notes on his little “satirical sketch.”  For example if he didn’t just imagine and actually talked to someone they might tell him their actual reasons for moving are climate-related or that despite his assumption that immigrants wouldn’t know about climate change a majority of people around the world including Latin America support climate action.  Most importantly though someone should tell him that really it’s weird for anyone in the 21st century to use the word “peasant” unironically.
