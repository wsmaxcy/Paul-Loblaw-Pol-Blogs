L, Let's write funny captions for pictures from President Biden's address to Congress, TrueBlueMajorityforDKonversation: Something to Talk About, 2021-04-29, Today’s question:   Comedy is one of the most important areas where the Blue Team has always had a clear advantage over our political opponents. Since I am not blessed with the gift of comedy I appreciate it all the more when I see someone else doing it well. “Caption this” photo threads are all over the place today so I thought DK could join in the fun. I have to leave the serious responses to last night’s speech for others to write. After all the intense news of the past few days I’d rather try to lighten the mood a little. #1:  Liz Cheney and Joe Biden fist bump We can assume Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) was seated on the aisle on purpose in the hope of creating an opportunity for a photo like this. What a surprise that the Cheney family is rejecting the Big Lie and managing to stand firm (so far) against the worst the GQP can throw at them. Caption this picture:    #2:  Chief Justice going solo like Diana Ross The Hon. John Roberts chief justice of the United States was the only member of the Supreme Court present at the address last night. It’s probably just as well that Justices Alito Barrett Kavanaugh and Thomas stayed home so we didn’t have to watch their disapproving smirks all night but it might have been fun to see Sotomayor Kagan and Breyer’s delight at hearing a real president speak. Caption this picture:    #3:  Ted Cruz takes a snooze One man’s excitement is another man’s snoozefest. Cruz claims he was bored by the speech but since he is not known for truth-telling I doubt that is the real reason he grabbed a bit of shut-eye. For all we know he did it on purpose to get attention. He was nodding off during the immigration reform part of the speech showing everyone his willingness to work with the president on an issue of primary importance to the state he ostensibly represents. Cruz is by far the easiest target of the night so even if you don’t have any ideas about the first two photos you might come up with something for this one.  Caption this picture:   That’s what I’m interested in talking about today but you can bring up anything you like in the comments.
