L, Trump's Social Media 'Lawsuit' Is Ridiculous Part Infinity, Common Dreams, 2021-07-08, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Critics of Donald Trump reacted with derision and disdain Wednesday after the former president announced a lawsuit against three tech firms and their CEOs that banned him for violating company policies against false and hateful posts. The Associated Press reports Trump announced his class-action suit against Facebook Twitter and Google-owned YouTube as well as respective CEOs Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai in Bedminster New Jersey Wednesday afternoon. "We're asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies' illegal shameful censorship of the American people" Trump said. "We're going to hold Big Tech very accountable." Trump's Facebook lawsuit is filed in federal court in Florida. Facebook's terms of service requires that "any claim cause of action or dispute you have against us" be filed in federal court in northern California or San Mateo County state court. — Brad Heath (@bradheath) July 7 2021 The mental (noun) of this lawsuit also hinges on the premise that when Facebook suspended Trump it did so as part of the government Trump *was then running*  since he was still you know the president — Devlin Barrett (@DevlinBarrett) July 7 2021 Trump—who is widely expected to run for president again in 2024—has been banned from the social media platforms since January when a mob consisting mostly of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. resulting in five deaths. According to the AP: Twitter Facebook and Google are all private companies and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that for instance are obscene or violate the services' own standards so long as they are acting in "good faith." The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post. Twitter permanently banned Trump while Facebook has barred the former president indefinitely and YouTube says it will lift the suspension on his channel when the risk of incitement to violence subsides. Trump is suing Facebook Twitter and Google for violating his 1st Amendment rights by keeping him off their platforms. Someone should remind him that they're private companies to which the 1st Amendment doesn't apply. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) July 7 2021 Critics of Trump were quick to note that the president is already fundraising off the lawsuit which some said is perhaps meant to distract from the indictment last week of longtime Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. How you know this is a unserious lawsuit: Trump is already fundraising off of it pic.twitter.com/Njq8VqHAdB — Sam Stein (@samstein) July 7 2021 Evan Greer deputy director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future said in a statement that "this is not a lawsuit. It's a fundraising grift." She continued: While it's silly to pretend that the moderation decisions of Big Tech don't have a significant impact on free expression the First Amendment enables private platforms to make exactly the kind of moderation decisions they wish to make as nongovernment entities. From a legal perspective this lawsuit is likely to go nowhere. Moreover its disingenuous attack on Section 230 reveals a laughable misunderstanding. Without 230 platforms would likely have removed controversial figures like Trump long ago. "Trump's legal showboating will fan the flames of unhelpful back and forth over whether platforms should or shouldn't deplatform a specific account" Greer asserted. Obviously Trump's lawsuit against Facebook and Twitter for censoring his posts is dumb and frivolous which you can conclude after reading the entire 44-page complaint or just after checking how many of his Very Serious Lawyers use their AOL email accounts https://t.co/bldN6MyIIv pic.twitter.com/XOqsXsa9vx — Jay Willis (@jaywillis) July 7 2021 "His bogus claims only create confusion and downplay legitimate concerns about how haphazard or overzealous content moderation leads to removal of content often disproportionately impacting marginalized communities" she added. Summing up the sentiments of many legal observers prominent legal scholar Lawrence Tribe tweeted: "If I were on the receiving end of this obviously bogus lawsuit I'd yawn. Then yawn again."
