C, Pro tip from Jenner: I'm only "kind of on the Republican side" ... when on CNN , Ed Morrissey, 2021-05-11, Less than a week ago Caitlyn Jenner embraced Trump MAGA the border wall a ban on transgenders competing in women’s sports and proclaimed support for law enforcement. That however all took place on Fox News’ Hannity. According to Politico Jenner has a different message for CNN’s audience: Reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner portrayed herself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal in a Monday CNN conversation that marked her second national TV interview since she launched her California gubernatorial recall campaign last month. Jenner emphasized some standard conservative positions on the economy and blocking illegal entry into the U.S. but eschewed more hardline positions. She initially pushed back when reporter Dana Bash called her a Republican saying she was “kind of on the Republican side.” Jenner is a registered Republican voter in Los Angeles County. “I don’t like labels you know” Jenner said. “I’m me. OK? This is how I do it. Just because I have conservative economic philosophy that’s the only thing that the Republicans are kind of on that I’m on. But I don’t know maybe you call me a Libertarian maybe you call me the middle. I really don’t know because when it comes to social issues I’m much more progressive much more liberal.” Er … what? Let’s recall what Jenner had to say to a very enthusiastic Sean Hannity and his red-meat audience last Wednesday: “I am all for the wall I would secure the wall. We can’t have a state we can’t have a country without a secure wall” Jenner told host Sean Hannity in her first major television interview since she entered the California governor’s race nearly two weeks ago. … Pressed on whether she would allow the state officials to work with ICE — presumably in deportations of undocumented immigrants — Jenner said: “I am for securing this state. I am pro-law enforcement. I am for border protection. I am pro-ICE. We need these people to to do their job.” … On the issue of transgender girls in sports Jenner stressed that “biological boys” should not participate in girls sports. “I think we have to make sure that the integrity of girls sports is there. I think that’s extremely important” she said. … “What I liked about Donald Trump was that he was a disrupter. He came in and shook the system up” she said. “He did some things that I agreed with some things that I didn’t agree with … On the other hand Biden I don’t think I’ve agreed with anything.” Not only do those issues have nothing to do with fiscal conservatism they’re all in the social-issue realm except for Trump. Where exactly does Jenner become a progressive? And if Jenner is “much more progressive much more liberal” on those issues shouldn’t she agree with Biden on at least some of those policies? Oddly enough Jenner didn’t mention a progressive/liberal streak with Hannity but instead fed him and his audience mainly red meat. It didn’t take Caitlyn Jenner long to become a professional politician eh? Not that it matters much anyway. Jenner’s in this for self-promotion and Gavin Newsom appears to have recaptured his political strength as COVID-19 cases plummet and restrictions ease. This is nothing but political theater now and Jenner is just proving exceptionally adept at it.
