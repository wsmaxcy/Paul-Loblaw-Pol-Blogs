L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Buddy Carter- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-29, On this date one year ago “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” first profiled U.S. House Representative from Georgia’s 1st Congressional District Buddy Carter who has served in Congress since first winning office in 2014. Prior to that he was festering around the Georgia state legislature for a decade from 2005 to 2014. It was in his last year in office in 2014 in the Georgia State Senate that he became the subject of controversy after he sponsored SB 408 which would add requirements on insurance companies which could make mail-order pharmacies lose some of their price advantage. Critics immediately pointed out that this was obvious self-dealing because Carter owned three local walk-in pharmacies and he scoffed instead attacking the media for reporting on his attempt at corruption and claiming “It was not a conflict of interest at all. This is just another example of the biased media attacking conservatives” And of courseCarter is still looking for ways to try and enrich himself based on voting now that he’s in Congress swearing to never make a vote that would support the Affordable Care Act and reacting to Senator Lisa Murkowski promising to vote against a repeal of it by saying that “Someone needs to go to the Senate and snatch a knot in their ass.”Classy.Other than that less than gentlemanly moment We want to point out that Buddy Carter once promised a constituent he would do what he could to clear Georgia’s backlog of rape kits laughing while saying “provided they weren’t from a sanctuary city” (indicating he’s fine with immigrants being raped and finds the thought amusing) also sponsored HB 586 in February of 2017 which had it passed would have outlawed abortion. Completely. Without any exceptions. From conception he wants all zygotes to have constitutional rights. (How they’re going to exercise their right to bear arms we can’t say but it’s the most Republican idea possible.)On immigration Buddy Carter deems that “granting amnesty to illegal immigrants is unconstitutional” and he supported Donald Trump’s bigoted Muslim travel ban from the moment it was announced. But he’s not just Islamophobic but transphobic as well supporting Donald Trump’s illogical random attempt to ban transgender troops from the armed services saying quite callously “I don’t want ‘em serving in the military. SORRY.”At his first town hall after the election of Donald Trump Congressman Carter told his constituents he would be “in the front of the line” to investigate Donald Trump should he have done anything illegal prior to getting elected in regards to soliciting help from a foreign power to interfere in our elections. Shock of shocks when Donald Trump had Bill Barr try to make the Mueller Investigation go away only to immediately commit other impeachable offenses and pressure Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden Carter’s reaction wasn’t to bury his head in the sand where he stood but to immediately declare the whistleblower complaint “wasn’t evidence of anything” from the jump and then dig in and spend the following months after it twisting himself in knots to keep an incompetent crook in office.      Rep. Carter’s disgraceful recent voting record: Georgia’s 1st Congressional District currently has a +9 Republican lean in the Cook Partisan Voting Index (prior to forthcoming redistricting) and that played out to the mathematical result of him winning re-election with 58% of the vote in November of 2020. Rep. Carter however is currently in the middle of a circular firing squad of Georgia Republicans blaming each other for the state flipping blue in 2020 overall and his seditious activities are getting called out by other candidates looking to bounce him from office in 2022.
