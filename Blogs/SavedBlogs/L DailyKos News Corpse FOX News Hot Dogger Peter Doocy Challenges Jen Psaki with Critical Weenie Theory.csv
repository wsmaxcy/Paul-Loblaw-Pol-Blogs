L, FOX News Hot Dogger Peter Doocy Challenges Jen Psaki with Critical Weenie Theory, News Corpse, 2021-07-03, Never let it be said that Fox News isn't on top of the issues that are uppermost on the minds of the American people. And on this 4th of July weekend Fox's Chief White House pest Peter Doocy demonstrated how devoted the Republican Ministry of Disinformation (aka Fox news) is to the mission articulated by their CEO Lachlan Murdoch to be "the opposition" to the Biden administration. Doocy has distinguished himself by volunteering his behind for frequent whoopings by the White House press secretary Jen Psaki. There aren't many "reporters" who are so selfless and/or masochistic. On this occasion Doocy bypassed any questions about the surging Delta variant of the COVID virus or the tragic collapse of the condo in Florida or the dramatic congressional battles over infrastructure and voting rights. Nope. Doocy courageously went straight for the footlong controversy over the cost of cookouts. He even drew a link to the price of gas. It was a frank exchange that went something like this...  Jen Psaki to Pete Doocy: WHY DO YOU HATE HOT DOGS #PsakiBomb pic.twitter.com/DRc4cQsuho  For the record this is the light-hearted post that the White House tweeted about 4th of July barbeque costs: Planning a cookout this year? Ketchup on the news. According to the Farm Bureau the cost of a 4th of July BBQ is down from last year. It’s a fact you must-hear(d). Hot dog the Biden economic plan is working. And that’s something we can all relish. pic.twitter.com/7h9qLauIbC  As is apparent many of the components of a holiday barbeque are indeed less expensive just like Psaki said. But this complex matter deserves a deeper examination. So let's begin with the fact that a reduction of any amount is significant. The prices for most consumer goods generally increase every year. But this year's decline indicates that even as the country is reopening from the pandemic and the economy is booming inflation does not appear to be a major worry. Undeterred by reality Doocy persisted with a deliberately hostile framing of his next question linking barbeque costs to gas prices. Psaki was prepared for this because she recently had to school Rep. Jim Jordan (OH-QAnon) on the subject. She replied to his ignorant tweet by noting "gas prices are the same now as they were in June 2018." Indeed any knowledgeable person knows that gas prices were artificially low last year due to that deadly pandemic thingy that kept people at home. Now that people are moving about again both the demand and the cost of fuel have returned to their pre-pandemic levels. Psaki skillfully spun Doocy's argumentative inquiry into an snarky insinuation that he is anti-hot dog. Then she steered the discussion back to a much more relevant issue to the American people: jobs. On that subject the Republican Party has been pitifully weak as they try to belittle the historic success of the Biden administration's first five months in office. The bottom line is that Doocy just can't resist trying to cast out questions that he thinks are bangers but which actually make him look like a wiener or wurst a brat. Okay I'm done now. And so is Doocy if he's smart. But we already know the answer to that. NOTE: Twitter recently suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
