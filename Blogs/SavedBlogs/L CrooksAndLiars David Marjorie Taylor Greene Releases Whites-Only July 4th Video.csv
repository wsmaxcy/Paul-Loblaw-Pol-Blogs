"Be sure to take some time to remember that freedom isn't free" Greene says "and how wonderful and what a blessing it is to be an American." 	Throughout the video the Georgia Republican poses with scores of people who all appear to be white. 	"Have a great and wonderful day today" she concludes. "God bless you all."
