From the New York Times: His bid to stay in office an extra two years without elections has led to gunfights in the capital and fears that Somalia is backsliding into a disastrous conflict. By Declan Walsh and Abdi Latif Dahir NAIROBI Kenya — During his years as an administrator at the Department of Transportation in upstate New York the Somali refugee turned American citizen took classes in political science imbibing democratic values he hoped to one day export back to his homeland. That dream came true for Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed in 2017 when he returned to Somalia and was elected president in a surprise victory that evinced high hopes he might reform — even transform — his dysfunctional war-weary country.

From Reuters:  From the New York Times: An estimated 100000 people had gathered on Mount Meron to celebrate a religious holiday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “terrible disaster.” By Isabel Kershner Eric Nagourney and Mike Ives JERUSALEM — A stampede early Friday at a mountainside religious celebration in Israel that drew tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews left at least 45 people dead and scores more injured. By some estimates about 100000 people were crammed together late Thursday to celebrate a holiday on Mount Meron in northern Israel despite warnings from the authorities about the risk of Covid-19 transmission. On the same incident this from the BBC: The disaster in which dozens of people were killed in a crush at a holy site in Israel happened as they marked the Jewish festival of Lag B'Omer. While the tens of thousands who were at the event were predominantly ultra-Orthodox Lag B'Omer is a festival which is celebrated by all manner of Jewish communities around the world. The festival itself commemorates two historical events according to Jewish tradition: the passing of revered Second Century sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai who ordained that the anniversary of his death be a time of rejoicing at his life; and the end of a plague which killed some 24000 students of another great rabbi Akiva Ben Yosef (who lived around the same time as Bar Yochai).

A study published Thursday in the journal Antiquity shows that the mysterious structures dotted around the desert in northwestern Saudi Arabia – called "mustatils" from the Arabic word for "rectangle" – are about 7000 years old. That’s much older than expected and about 2000 years older than either Stonehenge in England or the oldest Egyptian pyramid. From Mideast Eye: Rayhan Uddin Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's lengthy interview on state television earlier this week has already drawn headlines around his rhetoric against "religious extremists" and the interpretation of religious texts.

From the BBC: At least 31 people have been killed scores injured and 10000 evacuated after a water dispute led to some of the worst clashes in years on a disputed Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border.

From the New York Times: Amid the resistance to military rule some are saying that democracy can’t flourish without respecting the minorities that have been persecuted for decades. By Hannah Beech The Myanmar military’s disinformation was crude but effective. Army propagandists claimed an ethnic group called the Rohingya was burning down its own villages and wanted to swamp Buddhist-majority Myanmar with Islamic hordes. The Rohingya were spinning tall tales the military said in 2017 about soldiers committing mass rape and murder. From Reuters: Panu Wongcha-um Thousands of ethnic Karen villagers in Myanmar are poised to cross into Thailand if as expected fighting intensifies between the Myanmar army and Karen insurgents joining those who have already escaped the turmoil that followed a Feb. 1 coup.
