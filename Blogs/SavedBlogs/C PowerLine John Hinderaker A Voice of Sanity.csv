C, A Voice of Sanity, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-26, Tulsi Gabbard has left the House of Representatives and turned into something of a gadfly vis-a-vis her Democratic Party. On the roll of possible presidential contenders she is far from the bottom of my list notwithstanding that on bread and butter issues she has been a traditional Democrat. In this video she warns against the current effort by Democrats like John Brennan to infringe our constitutional rights. Gabbard has become a powerful voice for civil liberties:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
