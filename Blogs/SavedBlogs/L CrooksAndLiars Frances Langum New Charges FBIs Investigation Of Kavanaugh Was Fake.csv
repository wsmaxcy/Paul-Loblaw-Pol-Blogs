L, New Charges: FBI's Investigation Of Kavanaugh Was Fake, Frances Langum, 03-16-21, Above:  Even "The Daily Show" knew in 2018 that the FBI's five-day "investigation" of Brett Kavanaugh was a phoney operation to please the former guy's White House.  Who knew that the so-called FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh was a phony operation to give Republican Senators an out to vote for him to sit on the Supreme Court for life?   Everybody with a functioning brain that's who.   And now that the 2020 election put actual law enforcement in the Department of Justice it appears we'll find out just how shoddy an investigation it was.  The Guardian reports that "Sheldon Whitehouse a Democratic senator and former prosecutor who serves on the judiciary committee is calling on the newly-confirmed attorney general Merrick Garland to help facilitate “proper oversight” by the Senate into questions about how thoroughly the FBI investigated Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing." Uh oh.   Elections have consequences and there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.   Looks like its Brett Kavanaugh's time in the barrel https://t.co/9FrR4D4xT9 — Holly Figueroa O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) March 16 2021 I've always wondered why Kavanaugh didn't just explain what happened & how the debt came off his balance sheets to do away with lingering questions. https://t.co/3bAsCrji78 — Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) March 16 2021 Seriously pplBrett Kavanaugh only lied under oath abt-receiving stolen Leahy emails-warrantless wiretapping-Judge Pickering-Judge Pryor-when & how he learned of the Ramizez accusation-Ralphing-"Renate Alumnus"-Boofs-Devil's Triangle-The Maryland drinking age in 1982 https://t.co/XPuES64WwZ — John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) March 16 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
