C, A Job For Merrick Garland [with comment by Paul], John Hinderaker, 2021-01-11, Joe Biden tweeted this:  Who is going to break the news to Slow Joe that it is illegal for the federal government to discriminate on the basis of race and sex? I suppose that task will fall to the incoming Attorney General. It is remarkable that after decades on the Senate Judiciary Committee Biden thinks race and sex discrimination are A-OK.  Or maybe not so remarkable–this is the same Biden who in his vice-presidential debate with Sarah Palin didn’t know the difference between the First Article of the Constitution and the Second. PAUL ADDS: As I discussed  here Oregon is giving preferences to Black owned businesses in its coronavirus relief program. That practice has been challenged in two lawsuits. Look for plenty of additional litigation if Biden gives priority to businesses based on the race ethnicity or gender of the owner.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
