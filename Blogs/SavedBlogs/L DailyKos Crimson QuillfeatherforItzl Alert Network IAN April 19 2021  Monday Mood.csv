L, IAN: April 19 2021:  Monday Mood, Crimson QuillfeatherforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-18, It’s been a crazy day. I wasn’t sure I’d find enough on Twitter for tonight but I had a stash in my bookmarks. Halleluiah!  Did you watch Viola Davis on 60 min tonight? Wow!!!   “Did you know you had talent deep down?” Jon Wertheim asks Viola Davis. “Abso-freakin-lutely” says the actress who played imaginary characters growing up. https://t.co/HDhAJVULRp pic.twitter.com/ujqFiJ16tv .  i am now interested in being a gardener if this happenshttps://t.co/1Y0c1VYLHW  .  600 years old Ottoman arrowheads... pic.twitter.com/JSQzVNtPEt  .

These Google timelapses show how much the Earth has changed since 1984 — and it’s not often for the better pic.twitter.com/wBLfyAECOf  This is the Itzl Alert Network.  (Itzl is the name of the dog in the picture.)   We publish a diary here every day just before midnight. This group is here for us to check in with each other to let people know we are alive and doing OK.  We have split up the publishing duties but we welcome everyone in IAN to do daily diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! If you would like to write a diary let us know in a comment. We would love it if you joined our list of writers. You can sometimes alternate with someone. New voices are always good for a group. ++++++++++++++++++ Monday: Crimson Quillfeather. Tuesday: ejoanna.  Wednesday: Pam from California. Thursday: art ah zen.  Friday: FloridaSNMOM. Saturday: OPEN.  Sunday: loggersbrat Frog whisperer?   Volume up!
