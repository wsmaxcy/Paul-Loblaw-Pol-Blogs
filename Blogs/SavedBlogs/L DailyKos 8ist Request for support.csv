L, Request for support, 8ist, 2021-05-09, Jamesdead is truly and finally dead!  My name is James and I can’t type very well although I am improving my keyboarding speed and accuracy. The name “Jamesdead” was supposed to be “Jamesisdead”. Poor keyboarding skills and the lack of attention to that current task left me with a moniker that I did not want. There is a personal story that was behind the desired name but I would prefer not to try and tell that story.  Recently over the course of three days I followed the steps for changing/recovering my password (several times and unsuccessfully) as directed by “The Help” on the front page. So my fellow Kossacks “8ist” has been birthed. I thought that I had thought out this name better but as soon as I completed the steps in creating it I thought of a better one.    I do want to thank everyone for their financial support a few months ago. I still don’t feel that I thanked everyone adequately. I would open my laptop fully intending on making a personal thank you to everyone. The reality was that I would open my laptop and then freeze. I managed to personally thank a few individuals but I mostly just looked at the wallpaper and background on my laptop.  I have finally emerged from not only the diagnosis of a Major Depressive Episode.  But I finally feel that I have moved forward from my staggering loss during the last ten years. I was speaking to my son earlier today. He kept telling me how great I sound to him. That there is some joy back in my voice and personality.  I  have been so fortunate to obtain a part-time job that is perfect for my needs my schedule and importantly my dog Cinnamon! My friend and the link  to obtaining this job has been able to recruit her family in caring for Cinnamon while I am work. Therefore Cinnamon is able to play with her best friend Nora! They run play fight and chew on each other for the four hours that I am at work. I clock out and go pick up my very tired and VERY loved dog.  To continue this wonderful journey with my dog and career I need to be able to drive Cinnamon to see her friend and for me to arrive promptly for my shift beginning at 07:00 am. This is where my dilemma begins my recent car accident provided less than 25% of the immediate repairs to keep me driving. I paid out of pocket $1750.  I still have close to four thousand dollars of repair to keep me driving safely. It seems folly to me to put another $4K of repair in a vehicle that has a Kelley Blue Book value of $436.00.  I am waiting for my IRS refund of $2800 and I am asking my fellow Kossacks to match my $2800 in hopes of getting a more reliable and safe vehicle.  I desperately want to continue my journey out of the hell that I have endured over the previous ten years.  For those who wish to contribute to my request my PayPal account is under “jamesiscool@comcast.net”. For those who wish to offer support but do not want to use PayPal I have a Zelle account. I can be supported with my email account “jjshumaker60@gmail.com”. Honestly I would prefer to use my Zelle account and not PayPal. Whatever allows support without creating any cognitive dissonance for anyone. Thank you!
