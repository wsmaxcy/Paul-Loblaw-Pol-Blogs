L, Vaccinations of Juveniles Will Likely Begin This Week, mastergardener2k, 2021-05-10, www.cnn.com/… The Food and Drug Administration is giving emergency approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid Vaccine for use in juveniles from 12 to 15 years old.  Several of the vaccine manufacturers are conducting limited trials for younger groups. Vaccinations of young people will not only increase the percentage of the population with immunity to Covid but also make full opening of schools more feasible which in turn means more parents can return to work. Pfizer has also applied for regular use of its vaccine with the FDA. All the vaccines currently only have emergency approval. If the vaccine achieves that status it would remove one argument that people use to avoid vaccinations.  For the US population as a whole 45.8% have received at least one dose of vaccine as of yesterday. Adult Americans are 58% vaccinated with at least one shot. Senior Americans have achieved a level of 83.6% with at least one jab. About 2.16 million doses are going into American arms daily a rate that has fallen off in the last month. news.yahoo.com/… In the fourth month of his presidency Biden's overall approval rating sits at 63%. When it comes to the new Democratic president's handling of the pandemic 71% of Americans approve including 47% of Republicans.
