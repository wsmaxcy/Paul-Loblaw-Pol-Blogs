C, President Trump: Declassify It All., Art Harman, 2021-01-05, This is a summary of my article at Epoch Times @toddstarnes Dec 11 At this point @realDonaldTrump should declassify everything. Everything. @realDonaldTrump Dec 12 I have been doing this. I agree! A few sources claim President Trump will do a great declassification of documents before leaving office. This would be excellent but must be started immediately. The president should use his final days in office to strike blows against the ‘deep state’ corrupt Democrats foreign enemies and all who have endangered our national security and domestic liberties. In other words declassify far more than has been to date. The president should declassify and publicly release everything possible within these categories as well as release all such non-classified information that is currently unknown to the public. This should become the highest priority in the White House through January 20. Biden has already signaled he will retreat from President Trump’s retaliation to China’s trade war and may abandon the South China Sea and Taiwan. Iran has already been promised it will receive the gift of lifted sanctions and a resumption of trade by reinstating the Iran deal that secures their ability to build atomic weapons and the ICBMs to deliver them anywhere on earth. Public release of key documents classified or not as the light of truth will help restrain the worst instincts of Biden Harris those who will run their administration as well as a Democrat Congress. Here’s some categories of documents to declassify and release—or merely release if not classified. There’s always a balance between the need to declassify information of importance to justice and the national debate and the need to protect sources and methods. Due to the magnitude of the possible long-term harm to our liberty and national security from continued secrecy in these specific categories the need to expose these threats should tilt the balance towards declassification. Additionally the Biden administration may destroy or bury many such documents forever covering up any crimes aid to and collusion with our enemies and the agendas of those who aim to take away American constitutional liberties. Merely declassifying such documents doesn’t mean they wouldn’t forever remain hidden from the public or could still be destroyed by the incoming administration. Everything whether declassified or never-classified must be publicly released before January 20. President Trump has the authority to declassify and release any such documents and this final action would strike a great blow for liberty and against enemies of liberty. January 20 is fast approaching. It is time to act. Mr. President declassify and release everything. —————————————————————— Read More Red State Articles by Art Harman Art Harman is the President of the Coalition to Save Manned Space Exploration a space advocacy organization supporting the return to the moon by 2024.
