L, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Self-Owns With Tweet About Facebook’s Extremist Warning, Lee Moran, 2021-07-02, Facebook warned Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) in an automated message that she could have been exposed to extremist content and the irony did not go unnoticed by critics. The conspiracy theory-endorsing Georgia Republican who has previously claimed Jewish space lasers started wildfires in California and likened House mask mandates to the Holocaust on Thursday tweeted a screenshot of the note: I have to say I sure am glad that Facebook cares about me like this.I’m going to have to ask them to protect me bc I’ve been exposed to the radical Democrat’s bills this week which certainly is extremist content. pic.twitter.com/4Cg5PJOW7h “Violent groups try to manipulate your anger and disappointment” Facebook’s message read. “You can take action now to protect yourself and others.” It also suggested that Greene “get support from experts.” “I have to say I sure am glad that Facebook cares about me like this” Greene tweeted before claiming she’d been “exposed to the radical Democrat’s (sic) bills this week which certainly is extremist content.” Critics pointed out the self-own: You were exposed to your own post. Tell me you align with radicalized misinformation without telling me. https://t.co/BkbQ5bZJgR We’re you harassing yourself on Facebook? Facebook needs to learn that some people ARE the harmful extremist content. She’s posting a self own. https://t.co/rFXV5OXjvr If you can't recognize the obvious I certainly won't point it out to you tonight "exposed to harmful extremist content recently"Facebook is referring to the latest rally with Trump of course. Yeah…not sure this flatters you the way you think it does… You have literally made a living off of extremist content.
