L, This is what makes America exceptional and it's what the Right would deny you., Egberto Willies, 2021-07-05, Many who tout America as exceptional fail to see that their claim to exceptionalism is not meritorious. But this is. Happy 4th. See full episodes here. As we celebrate the 4th of July it is imperative that we see America from an intellectually honest point of view. After all Americans are not the only ones privy to the reality of history. We tend to believe that because we articulate something that it will be taken as true irrespective of whether it bears any semblance to the lived experiences of many from the inception of this country. We should be much more humble in our celebration of the 4th of July. Much of what many in the right consider exceptional too many it is downright obscene. The Right is more interested in writing and indoctrinating with a history that never was. They want to create a reality that promotes a certain kind of fallacy that ultimately marginalizes natives and many others on whose back the country was built. All is not lost if we really celebrated one thing that makes this country exceptional. And it has more to do with the freedom we still have to object to the fallacies as we attempt to reprogram many from the codified lies. Make a commitment to read "A People's History of the United States." It will provide a necessary perspective.
