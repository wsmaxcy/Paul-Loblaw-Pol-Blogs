L, Republicans Squabble Over How Tiny An Infrastructure Package To Demand, Laura Clawson, 04-17-21, As President Joe Biden pushes for his American Jobs Plan which repairs and upgrades existing U.S. infrastructure while expanding into  what the country will need for the future Republicans are trying to  figure out exactly what they are for. Some Republicans simply  aren’t willing to say anything but what they’re against. Others could  maybe get on board with a plan that does a fraction of what’s needed to  update 20th-century infrastructure—but forget about the needs of the  century we’re already 20% of the way through.   Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Wednesday  that she thought Republicans would go for $600 billion to $800 billion  in infrastructure spending. That’s far smaller than the $2.3 trillion  Biden is proposing but it’s a “sweet spot” Capito said—before quickly  backtracking after her fellow Republicans indicated that it was too much  for them. One-third of what Biden wants “seems a little high” Sen. Mitt Romney said. An estimated $41.8 billion is needed to repair structurally deficient bridges alone—never mind getting ahead of the bridges that will become structurally  deficient in the coming years. Or talking about roads rail broadband  schools veterans’ hospitals ports airports replacing lead pipes for  drinking water caring for our elders while boosting some of the  fastest-growing occupations and supporting medical manufacturing.   As absurd a low-ball as Capito’s $600 to $800 billion was though at  least she said something that she would be willing to talk about. More  Republicans are just saying “No! Smaller!” and counting on voters to recoil from a corporate tax increase.   Voters however support raising corporate taxes to pay for infrastructure—in one poll telling people that infrastructure would be paid for by a corporate tax hike actually increases support for the plan. Another new poll  from Navigator Research finds narrow majority support for the  infrastructure plan that grows to 70% support when people learn what’s  in it with large majorities of independent voters supporting  many of the specific components of the American Jobs Plan including  the senior care proposal that congressional Republicans are so intent on  disqualifying as “not really infrastructure.”   Even a majority of Republicans polled support that proposal along  with eliminating lead pipes investing to protect against future  pandemics investing in rail systems upgrading and building new schools  and child care facilities and more. Things like clean energy and  investing in communities of color don’t get Republican  majorities but they do get independent majorities and strong Democratic  support. If these proposals would get support from just half the  proportion of Republican lawmakers as Republican voters they would be  seen as strongly bipartisan. But instead congressional Republicans  ignore the polling and yell about how Biden is steamrolling them because  his willingness to compromise doesn’t extend to being steamrolled  himself. These people are not operating in good faith. Doing so would be  in violation of their deepest principles and would probably get them  kicked out of their party. And they should be dealt with—and reported  on—accordingly. Posted with permission from Daily Kos. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
