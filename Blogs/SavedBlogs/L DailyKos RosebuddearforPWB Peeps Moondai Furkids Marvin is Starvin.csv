L, Moondai Furkids: Marvin is Starvin, RosebuddearforPWB Peeps, 2021-04-26, Well not really. But *he* certainly thinks so.  Recently Buzzy and yours truly both went to the doctor for annual checkups. (Marvin being on an entirely different schedule is not due yet.) The results were strangely similar for those of the hooman and those of the feline persuasion.  While both hooman and pootie have a generally clean bill of health we have both in this year of Covid gone over the ledge into (dum da dum dum) Unhealthy Weight Territory. In Buzzy’s case a 1 pound weight gain and in Mom’s case a 6 pound weight gain over the last year has um tipped the scales so to speak. (Mom is just one BMI point over but you know. VA Doc says well it’s up to you of course but you know the more you put on the harder it is to take off. Sigh. She is quite right.)  So it’s veggies and fruits and avoidance of all things delicious for Mom and for Buzz (and Marvin since they eat together) it’s No More Full Bowls sitting around all day long for snacking. They get fed twice a day and after a reasonable amount of time those bowls are taken up till the next feeding.  Marvin considers this most unfair. “Why should I be on a diet TOO Mom?”. Well you’re not little doofus. Any time he actually wants more food enough to come ASK me he gets it. I am not out to starve anybody. But you know the sight of *gasp* occasional white space at the bottom of the food dish fills his gluttonous little soul with the deepest anxiety.  It’s pretty unfair anyway that Buzz should have a weight problem and Marvin should not. Marvin is a total little chowhound and glutton and steals all Buzz’s food to the point where I have to take steps to make sure that Buzz is actually getting enough to eat and yet Buzz has gained weight and Marvin has not.  Why you ask? Welp Marvin is VERY VERY ACTIVE. Like All the Time. For an eight year old pootie he is a little powerhouse of mischief and energy still. I would not have him any other way. Buzz is much more um relaxed. His idea of a good time is a nap with Mom. Marvin’s is destroying whatever is handy and tearing his shirt up and down the hallway at all hours.   Happy Monday everybody!
