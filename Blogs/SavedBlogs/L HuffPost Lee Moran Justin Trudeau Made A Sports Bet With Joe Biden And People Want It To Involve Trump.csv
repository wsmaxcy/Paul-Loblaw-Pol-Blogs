L, Justin Trudeau Made A Sports Bet With Joe Biden And People Want It To Involve Trump, Lee Moran, 2021-06-29, President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau engaged in some lighthearted sporting banter over the Stanley Cup Final. Trudeau a die-hard fan of the Montreal Canadiens suggested making his side’s best-of-seven playoffs against the Tampa Bay Lightning a little bit more interesting with this tweet for Biden: Two of the best teams in the NHL are facing off right now… how about a friendly wager @POTUS? #GoHabsGo 🇨🇦🇺🇸 #StanleyCup Biden or whoever was running the official @POTUS account at the time responded: You’re on pal. #GoBolts https://t.co/jOhA7IB2bE Former President Barack Obama twice had to give cases of beer to then-Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper after losing similar hockey wagers while in office. Biden’s prospects are already looking better than those of his predecessor though. The Lightning won the first game 5-1. The second game of the series is on Wednesday. It’s not clear what the two will bet. But Twitter users had some ideas some of which involved former President Donald Trump: If Canada wins we have to adopt their healthcare system. 🥶 Thanks Joe. The former guy would have told us how no one knows hockey like him. If Montreal wins the US will send you Trump If Tampa Bay wins Canada gets Trump. @JustinTrudeau Canada wins and the US adopts Canada’s health systemAmerica wins and Canada opens the border back up like even past the “open” of pre-COVID. Like 70s Vietnam-era open. Let’s make this fun If the Habs win Canada gets Hawaii. If the Bolts win  we'll take Bieber back. loser has to release one classified dossier at random https://t.co/UbSTzpxQbJ If the Canadians win US gives Canada Alaska.
