L, It’s Time To Emancipate Ourselves from the Senate’s Sinful Malapportionment by Passing Rule #45, Brad Kirk, 2021-05-01,  The corrupt Connecticut Compromise of 1787 (granting equal power in the Senate to each state regardless of population) was and is an abomination.   It is our nation’s second original sin (after slavery).  We must  emancipate ourselves from this barbaric relic.  The U.S. Senate is today’s “peculiar institution” one who’s galactic malapportionment makes us nearly ungovernable as well as the laughing stock of the civilized world.  Giving citizens of small states unfair-sized power in the Senate was vehemently opposed by the Father of the Constitution James Madison.  He Alexander Hamilton George Washington Benjamin Franklin and the other framers of goodwill were blackmailed by small states’ threats to invite foreign intervention.  They were forced to appease the backstabbers’ dictate. This ill-gotten small state monarchical privilege is illegitimate.  It is ineffective.  It is anti-democratic.    All it takes to fix the Senate is a simple majority of senators to add an internal senate rule calling for population weighted voting within the Senate.  That’s it.  This could be done tomorrow.  “We the people” need to force our modern masters into doing the right thing!   Here's what you can do: Contact your two senators and insist they vote for a new Senate rule calling for population weighted voting.  (Call it Rule #45 since there are already 44 rules.)  Fire them if they don’t.
