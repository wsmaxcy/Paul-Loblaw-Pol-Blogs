C, The Week in Pictures: Kamala’s Kookies Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-12, It was a tough call deciding on the lead theme for the week given how Jeffrey Toobin’s reinstatement at CNN summons fond memories of the eternal return of Anthony Weiner. It just shows that the Toobin Missile Crisis wasn’t armageddon for his media career. But Kamala Harris distributing faceless cookies of herself has to be perfectly fitting for her faceless clueless vice presidency.                                              Headlines of the week: Okay this one is fake (Babylon Bee)… but accurate!                 Question: If a tree farts in the forest and there’s no one around to hear it does a climate model still smell it?                     Or as I like to say vodka corrupts and Absolute vodka corrupts Absolutly.                  And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
