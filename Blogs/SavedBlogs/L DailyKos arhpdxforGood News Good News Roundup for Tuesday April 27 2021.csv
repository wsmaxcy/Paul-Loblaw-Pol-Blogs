L, Good News Roundup for Tuesday April 27 2021, arhpdxforGood News, 2021-04-27, Greetings to all you Gnusies Gnubies occasional drop-ins silent regulars and first-timers! Come sit with us to find and share messages of hope and to celebrate all the ways good people are solving problems and triumphing over evil-doers. The task we have set ourselves here in Gnuville is to search out hope no matter how difficult the situation might be. We’ve learned over the past four years that hope can be found even in the darkest times. And with the Biden era off to a roaring start there’s so much good news and so much hope that it’s gotten hard to pare Good News Roundups to a reasonable length!   Don’t forget that the Good News Roundup is a collaborative effort. We warmly encourage you to add your own good news finds in our comment section The Best Comment Section on the Internet™ where sanity reigns Gloomy Guses and Debbie Downers are encouraged to see the light and pie fights are forbidden. Let’s get to the good news! Settle in because this is a looooong GNR. I just couldn’t stand eliminating any of these stories. 💙 On the face of it this headline for a recent op-ed in the Washington Post by Christine Emba is hardly good news: “Everyone is tired. We need to give ourselves an actual break.” But bear with me. Every era has its typical disorder but our own might have several. Even before the pandemic our depression and anxiety were well-documented; so too were our burnout and anomie. The coronavirus has allowed us to put a name to our feelings: These days we’re “languishing” or “hitting the wall.” Underlying it all is a feeling of being deeply deeply tired. The United States has never had a great understanding of leisure let alone actual rest. From our Protestant work ethic to our bootstraps mythology we have enshrined work as the highest good — quietude is if not a sin an indulgence we do not quite deserve. Our capitalist system privileges and rewards constant growth; we tend to feel worthless if we’re not being “productive” or optimizing ourselves in some way. ✂️ ...instead of snapping back to normal once we’ve had our shots we should take our newly recognized existential tiredness as an indication that it’s time to change course — to realize that we need to give ourselves an actual break. Emba links to a piece in the NY Times by Adam Grant that has a similar message — There’s a Name for the Blah You’re Feeling: It’s Called Languishing: At first I didn’t recognize the symptoms that we all had in common. Friends mentioned that they were having trouble concentrating. Colleagues reported that even with vaccines on the horizon they weren’t excited about 2021. … It wasn’t burnout — we still had energy. It wasn’t depression — we didn’t feel hopeless. We just felt somewhat joyless and aimless. It turns out there’s a name for that: languishing. Languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness. It feels as if you’re muddling through your days looking at your life through a foggy windshield. And it might be the dominant emotion of 2021.  Recognize those symptoms? That feeling? That so many of us share this state of mind is obviously not good news. But it is good news that we’re being encouraged to recognize it. Because that allows us to accept the need to give ourselves a break. I think it’s especially hard to allow ourselves to take time for rest and healing if we think we’re alone in our distress. Knowing that many many others feel the same distress can help us avoid any feelings of guilt or embarrassment for using time and energy to overcome it. Listening to music is one of the ways I take time for healing. Here’s a piece I often turn to: one of Bach’s most beautiful and most serene compositions “Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring” (unfortunately mistranslated in this video’s title). It invites us into a space of utter peace. Angela Hewitt the greatest living interpreter of Bach’s music performs it with great subtlety and tenderness.    A personal anecdote about Hewitt and this piece: in 2001 she was scheduled to perform in Portland the week after the events of 9/11. All the airports were shut down so the only way she could get from her home in Canada to Portland was by car. We weren’t sure when (or even if) she would arrive until just a few hours before we entered the concert hall. She walked onstage to enthusiastic grateful applause then sat at the piano and said that she wanted to dedicate her first piece to the 9/11 victims. It was of course this piece. Everyone wept openly tears of grief but also tears of release from the despair of that week. It was the most beautiful and moving musical experience I’ve ever had. Hunger in the U.S. especially as it affects children has been my focus and passion as an activist for close to 40 years so I find this piece of good news from the Biden administration especially heartening. From the New York Times: With more than one in 10 households reporting that they lack enough to eat the Biden administration is accelerating a vast campaign of hunger relief that will temporarily increase assistance by tens of billions of dollars and set the stage for what officials envision as lasting expansions of aid. The effort to rush more food assistance to more people is notable both for the scale of its ambition and the variety of its legislative and administrative actions. The campaign has increased food stamps by more than $1 billion a month provided needy children a dollar a day for snacks expanded a produce allowance for pregnant women and children and authorized the largest children’s summer feeding program in history. “We haven’t seen an expansion of food assistance of this magnitude since the founding of the modern food stamp program in 1977” said James P. Ziliak an economist at the University of Kentucky who studies nutrition programs. “It’s a profound change.” ✂️ The push reflects an extraordinary shift in the politics of poverty — driven paradoxically both by the spread of hardship to more working-class and white families and the growing recognition of poverty’s disproportionate toll on minorities. With hunger especially pronounced among Black and Latino households vital to the Democrats’ coalition the administration is framing its efforts not just as a response to pandemic needs but as part of a campaign for racial justice.  I’m so proud to have Merkley as one of my senators!  From The Bend Bulletin: Sen. Jeff Merkley reintroduced a proposal Thursday to force drug makers to sell prescription drugs at lower prices that are closer to what patients in other upper-income countries pay. The Oregon Democrat hopes that will push the Biden administration to include the regulations in its soon-to-be-released American Families Plan. “We have allowed Americans to be ripped off for far too long” Merkley said Thursday in a call with reporters. “It’s an issue that no matter whether if I’m in a blue county or a purple county or a red county citizens want us to address it.” Merkley said he’s heard from constituents around the state about their struggles with high-priced pharmaceuticals including a man in Douglas County whose daughter relies on a seizure medication that costs $45000 a vial here compared with $200 in Canada. President Joe Biden is expected to unveil the plan in the coming days before he delivers an April 28 address to Congress.  Whether this turns out to be good news or bad news can’t be predicted at this point. Keep your fingers crossed!  From OPB: ...in order to stop Republicans from using delay tactics to slow bills House Speaker Tina Kotek D-Portland has agreed to give the GOP an equal say on a House committee tasked with redrawing maps. Senate President Peter Courtney D-Salem is expected to do the same for the Senate Redistricting Committee though he has refused to confirm or deny that. Even parity in one chamber however gives Republicans what amounts to veto power. If lawmakers are split along party lines over new maps in committee those maps can’t pass out for a full vote. Such a deadlock would ensure lawmakers are unable to pass their own plan by a late September deadline. ✂️  If lawmakers fail to find agreement responsibility for drawing new state House and Senate boundaries would fall to Secretary of State Shemia Fagan a liberal Democrat. But a new congressional map would become the purview of a panel of judges in a process that has never been tested. From The Oregonian: The Portland area’s first motel to be converted into a shelter under Oregon’s $65 million program to remake motels into new homes for those made homeless by wildfires or poverty will open in Hillsboro July 1. A former 60-room Econo Lodge near downtown will be converted into an emergency shelter for individuals experiencing homelessness and for seasonal and migrant workers impacted by COVID-19. The 60 rooms will be private shelter rooms.✂️ Washington County has partnered with Bienestar and the Urban League of Portland to provide programming and supportive services to shelter clients. The partnership will work to serve underserved populations including Black Indigenous and other people of color.  The righting of this wrong is long overdue. (The story is behind a paywall so I’ll try to quote enough to flesh it out.) From The Oregonian: ...the southwest corner [of Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland OR] has no trees nor gravestones or roses. The land was known as the Old Chinese Burial Ground — now Block 14 — and was used to temporarily bury early Chinese immigrant workers until their remains could be sent to their hometowns. For some however it became their final resting place but a forgotten one devoid of markers remembrances or respect. At one point the burial ground was paved over its history neglected replaced by a county maintenance building. But not everyone forgot. Activists have fought for more than a decade to reverse the injustices to those still buried there and remember their history even as those efforts were pushed to the side. Now Metro [the regional government for greater Portland’s tri-county area] has dedicated $4 million to building a cultural heritage garden on Block 14 to honor the dead whose names and stories had been lost. ✂️ The workers arrived in the United States in the late 1800s leaving their families behind in China to build infrastructure here. The men buried at Block 14 helped build Oregon’s railway system and the Willamette River seawall — while being taken advantage of financially for their work. The Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 struck another blow preventing laborers from ever becoming U.S. citizens or returning home to their families.  Go Washington!! Shutting down that appalling ICE facility is especially good news. From KNKX: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill Wednesday banning all private for-profit prisons. The new law means the privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Tacoma will have to close after its contract expires in 2025. A previous story put the legislation in context: Lawmakers say at least 22 other states have stopped detaining people in private prisons. In 2019 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that bans private prison companies from operating in that state. After the law passed GEO Group one of the largest private prison companies in the country sued California over the new law. GEO Group operates facilities across the country including the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. ✂️ California however has largely been able to defend any legal challenges with a federal judge in San Diego reasoning states should have the authority to ensure the health and welfare of inmates and detainees.  Darcelle (Walter Cole) “The World’s Oldest Drag Queen” is a Portland icon. He’s not only a hero to our local LGBTQ community he’s also a generous philanthropist and all-around good guy. From msn: The Darcelle Project a multi-dimensional celebration of “world’s oldest drag queen” and Portland mainstay Darcelle is a recipient of a 2020 Oregon Heritage Excellence Award from the Oregon Heritage State Historic Preservation Office. The project spearheaded by Donald Horn included a musical and an Oregon Historical Society exhibit that celebrated the history of Walter Cole the man who started the Portland club Darcelle XV over 50 years ago and who at age 90 still performs as Darcelle. Darcelle XV and Cole’s home were both placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. “I hear from so many that theatre is just stage plays/musicals but to me it’s so much more” Horn said in a press release. “It’s a community servicing a community.”  Despite COVID Portland is continuing to attempt to live up to its motto: “Keep Portland Weird”! No official ride as in years past but anyone who wants to “un-suit up” on June 27th is enthusiastically encouraged to do so. From KGW: The official version of the Portland World Naked Bike ride scheduled for June 27 has been canceled due to concerns over spreading the COVID-19 virus.  Organizers said while there will be no official specific start time and location enthusiasts should still head out on their own if they wish. Here’s some more music to help you feel calm and centered. This is by Brian Eno the master of ambient electronic music from his ground-breaking album “Music for Airports.”  It’s way past time to shut down the rape of America’s water resources by Nestlé a company with a long history of malfeasance. It would help if we all stopped buying their products especially their bottled water: Nestlé Pure Life Perrier and S.Pellegrino. From Reuters: California's Water Resources Control Board on [April 23rd] asked Nestlé (NESN.S) to stop unauthorized natural spring water diversions in the San Bernardino Forest after a probe revealed multiple violations and depletion of resources. The action comes as the state ramps up efforts to preserve water resources amid worsening drought conditions. The order is in response to several water rights complaints and an online petition against Nestlé Waters North America starting in 2015 which led to drinking water supply shortages and impacted environmental resources. Nestlé one of the world's largest bottled water companies has 20 days to respond to the draft cease and desist order and request a hearing or the State Water Board may issue a final order the board said.  From The Sacramento Bee: Benjamin Kuo has what he calls “a very weird hobby.” “I love taking a look at photos and figuring out where they’re taken” Kuo told KNBC. On Tuesday his fascination with satellite photos may have saved a man’s life. Rene Compean became lost Monday while hiking in the Angeles National Forest in Southern California the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reported. The 45-year-old had sent a photo of his legs dangling over the edge of a canyon to a friend before texting that he was lost and his phone battery was dying McClatchy News previously reported. On Tuesday sheriff’s officials released the photo to the public in hopes that someone might recognize the scenery and help them pinpoint Compean’s location. Someone did. “You don’t think that sitting behind a computer and looking at a picture and saying ‘Oh it looks like that might be where he is’ would lead to a person being rescued” Kuo told KCBS. But he went ahead and notified the sheriff’s office of his hunch including GPS coordinates KNBC reported. ✂️ Searchers dispatched a helicopter which found Compean on a ridge less than a mile from Kuo’s coordinates Tuesday afternoon.  This falls in the category of “Who knew??” I’m giving you just the opening paragraphs — click the link to read the whole fascinating story. From Mountain Rose Herbs: When our Mountain Rose Herbs tea team was introduced to yaupon we—like most Americans—had no idea that there was a naturally caffeinated tea plant native to North America. This fact is astounding when you consider that yaupon tea was the drink of choice for literally thousands of years. This delicious tea is supremely sippable and thanks to plentiful theophylline and theobromine (as well as a host of vitamins minerals amino acids etc.) provides a smooth caffeine boost and focus without the jitteriness that can come from coffee. ...this American wunderkind—which was at one time so popular the British East India Company considered it a threat to their control of the world’s tea market—has been completely forgotten for more than 150 years replaced by coffee and traditional black teas even in regions where it grows wild. What happened?! We reached out to the American Yaupon Association to learn more about yaupon tea and its spectacular comeback.✂️ Ilex vomitoria [The Latin name comes from an incorrect belief by Europeans that the plant caused vomiting in certain ceremonies] or yaupon holly (pronounced “yo-pawn”) is native to the American southeastern coastal plains (yerba mate and Guayusa are its South American cousins). Yaupon is a common evergreen understory tree or shrub distinguished by dense ovular green leaves and bright red berries that ranges from the Eastern Shore of Virginia south to Florida and west to Texas and Oklahoma. This is the most amazing story I’ve read in a very long time. From Good News Network: Described in texts thousands of years old Dhaka muslin is an ultra fine ultra soft fabric made from a potentially extinct species of sorry-looking cotton that grows along the banks of the holy Meghna River. The cotton known locally as phuti karpas was very delicate snapped and frayed easily and could only be finagled under conditions of extreme—sometimes artificially enhanced—humidity. Eventually though somewhere in the mists of time ancient Bangladeshi weavers managed to convert this unseemly plant into the height of luxury fabrics one which adorned Greek statues Mughal emperors the aristocracy of Europe and even the empress of France Josephine Bonaparte. ✂️ However the subjugation of local master weavers ... by the British East India Company resulted in many of the techniques being lost—even to this day and the scraggly cotton no longer needed receded into the wilds. ...One man however is on the path of reestablishing the Dhaka muslin trade as the world’s top textile. Saiful Islam runs Bengal Muslin a heritage crafting enterprise seeking to adapt the ancient techniques and restore the phuki karpas cotton plant. ✂️ Islam had to sequence its DNA from a single pressed specimen from the 19th century kept at the Royal Botanic Gardens. Then sailing up and down the Meghna River a major feeder for the Ganges he snapped up anything that looking like the pressed picture and eventually managed to find a plant that had about three-quarters of the same genetic code—an ancestor perhaps. ...Cultivating it on an island in the middle of the river Islam managed to produce enough to spin a thread using many improvisations to make up for the lack of ancestral knowledge. The next part was finding someone to weave the thread into a fabric. ✂️  From Reuters: The United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) and Venezuelan officials said on Monday they had reached a deal to supply food to school children in the South American country suffering a humanitarian crisis spurred by an economic collapse. The program will reach 185000 children in the crisis-stricken country this year and aims to expand to some 1.5 million by the end of the 2022-2023 school year the WFP said in a statement. Child malnutrition has increased in Venezuela as the once-prosperous country's economy collapsed. "This is the first step toward a series of ambitious projects that will provide food support to all of the Venezuelan people" Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said in an address from the Miraflores presidential palace broadcast on state television where visiting World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley was also present. ✂️ Beasley also met with Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and ambassadors from several European countries according to tweets from Guaido and France's ambassador. The agreement was applauded by Venezuelan aid workers and activists. "This agreement with the WFP to start operations in Venezuela is of vital importance" Feliciano Reyna president of Caracas-based aid group Accion Solidaria which focuses on HIV/AIDS treatment and other medical relief wrote on Twitter. "We hope it will build trust to broaden its areas of action."  From Good News Network: A company that uses gravity to create a ‘giant battery’ has just completed a successful test in Scotland paving the way for its commercial-scale roll out. The firm is called Gravitricity and their device which has a 25-year lifespan could help prevent the mining of rare earth minerals in the creation of lithium-ion batteries while providing a cost-effective alternative for renewable storage. Costing £1 million ($1385 million) to build a 15-meter (49-foot) tower with a 25-ton weight Gravitricity say the prototype can generate 250 kilowatt hours and deliver electricity in less than a second when demand occurs. The device has been designed to go in old mine shafts rather than up in the air and “These tests confirm our modeling and show that gravity energy storage is a serious contender in the global energy storage market” said company managing director Charlie Blair. The technology relies on sending excess power from renewables such as wind power into cable pulleys that slowly hoist a heavy weight up the tower storing potential gravitational energy that is released back into the system as electricity when the weights are lowered.  From Good News Network:  When Arctic gold miners discovered a lost and helpless bear cub whose mother had died it didn’t take long for her to melt their hearts. As the orphaned cub grew to trust the men the furry guest soon felt like a friend to the  workers on remote Severnaya Zemlya archipelago. She even loved bear hugs. But with the crew scheduled to leave the base when their work contract came to an end the vulnerable bear would be left to fend for herself. Between the threat from other predators and her lack of adequate hunting skills she wouldn’t manage to survive without help. ✂️ Having had no means of outside contact while at the base the men reached out to Moscow Zoo for guidance at their earliest opportunity. ✂️ “For right or wrong they fed the endangered animal and through that tamed it” [the zoo director] explained. “The shift workers saved its life the cub had no chance to survive.” So while it was technically against the law for the miners to care for the bear all things considered at least this now-not-so-little cub is receiving the help she needs and is being cared for in the way that suits her circumstances.  Bogdan (not his real name) is now in his second year of working in the [Chernobyl Exclusion Zone] and has got to know the dogs [who live in the zone] well. Some have names some don't. Some stay nearby others remain detached – they come and go as they please. Bogdan and the other guards feed them offer them shelter and occasionally give them medical care. They bury them when they die. All the dogs are in a sense refugees of the 1986 disaster in which Reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded. In the aftermath tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the Ukrainian city of Pripyat. They were told to leave their pets behind. (Read more about the long-term toll of the Chernobyl disaster.) ✂️  Jonathon Turnbull a PhD candidate in geography at the University of Cambridge realised it might be worth collecting [the guards’] stories. "If I wanted to know the dogs" he says "I needed to go to the people who know them best – and that was the guards." What he discovered is a heart-warming story of the guards' relationship with the animals they encounter in this abandoned environment – a tale that provides insights into the deep bond between humans and dogs. ✂️  When Turnbull who lives in Ukraine's capital Kyiv started making regular visits to the zone he met Bogdan and other checkpoint guards. They were reluctant to talk at first so he had to win them over. … His idea was to give the guards disposable cameras and ask them to take pictures of the dogs – not posed portraits but scenes of everyday life. The guards only had one other request - "please please – bring food for the dogs". So Turnbull did. ✂️ Bogdan says he is often asked why the dogs ought to be allowed to stay in the Exclusion Zone. "They give us joy" he replies. "For me personally this is a kind of symbol of the continuation of life in this radioactive post-apocalyptic world.” This is especially good news for Louisianans because the brown pelican is their state bird which almost went extinct from the effects of DDT in the 1960s. From Live Science: A brown pelican rescued from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill 11 years ago has finally returned home. After being found completely covered in oil on June 14 2010 the bird was taken from Louisiana to Georgia to avoid the ongoing spill where it was later rehabilitated and released. Now over a decade after its traumatic ordeal the pelican has finally made the 700-mile (1100 kilometers) journey back home. "It's truly impressive that it made its way back from Georgia" Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) biologist Casey Wright who spotted and photographed the pelican sitting atop a rock on Queen Bess Island in Barataria Bay said in a statement. The bird was identified by the tag that was clipped to its right leg after its rescue from Empire Jetty in Barataria Bay in the aftermath of the spill which smothered the Gulf of Mexico with more than 400000 tons (370000 metric tons) of oil. ✂️  One factor in this particular pelican's remarkable homecoming was the cleanup effort made by the LDWF to restore the animal's nesting area Queen Bess Island which accounts for 15% to 20% of the young brown pelicans that hatch in Louisiana each year Since NNNE and I write the GNR on alternate Tuesdays and since he always includes a gorgeous photo of Pressley I figured I’d better get in the game. As I mentioned in a comment on Sunday I learned only recently that April is Jazz Appreciation Month and I’m both amazed and chagrined that I hadn’t known that already. I was planning to append a collection of my favorite jazz performances to this GNR but it’s quite long enough already! So I’ve settled on a single performance a collaboration among three brilliant Black women musicians: pianist Geri Allen (now sadly decieased) bassist Esperanza Spaulding and drummer Terri Lyne Carrington. I lifted it from the wonderful DK diary that Denise Oliver Velez wrote to celebrate Geri Allen for Jazz Appreciation Month. This performance illustrates some of my favorite aspects of jazz: the generosity of spirit and surrender of ego shown by older musicians putting the young ones in the spotlight the deep respect and love shown to musical forebears and the simultaneous embrace of heritage and innovation that comes through in the music. All of that is represented here not only by the multi-generational trio but also by the fact that they’re putting their own spin on a 1970s composition by Wayne Shorter to celebrate his 80th birthday.  From the CBC: Anna Chojnicka never intended to become a banana artist. But in March 2020 when she became sick with a suspected case of coronavirus and was self-isolating at her London England home she started to go "a little bit stir crazy." "The result was banana art" Chojnicka told As It Happens guest host Nil Koksal. "It's now been almost 400 bananas." ✂️ "I don't use a pen or paint or anything" she said. "It's purely by using the peel of the banana.” Her tool of choice is a seam ripper but she says any pointed implement will do. After she draws by pressing into the banana peel causing it to oxidize or bruise the marks become darker over time and she uses that effect to create different shades. "I don't ... press harder to create a darker line or anything. It's all done in timing" she said. "You start with the parts that you want to be the darkest first and then you wait for that to get darker and then you do the slightly lighter parts next.” www.theatlantic.com/...Navalny Has a Lesson for the World: The Russian opposition leader is showing what courage means.”“Everything will be all right” he told [a journalist friend]. “And even if it isn’t we’ll have the consolation of having lived honest lives.”  www.theatlantic.com/...Return the National Parks to the Tribes. This is an important and enlightening piece.
