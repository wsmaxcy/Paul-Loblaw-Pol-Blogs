L, Fergus's Tale About Fergus's Tail, Aashirs naniforStreet Prophets, 2021-05-01,  Welcome to Street Prophets Coffee Hour at the intersection of religion and politics. I’m going to tell you about Fergus (see the spunky little cat above) and then the thread will be open. As many of you know by now I live on rural acreage in northeastern Kansas. One of the unfortunate truths about rural living is that city people do dump animals leaving them to fend for themselves. That’s often noted. But another unfortunate truth is that many rural people (a vet told me about half of her clients) do not feed their “pets” but let them range free to hunt for food. Many of them do exactly that—hunt for food. At my house. And they find it. About six years ago I had an exceptionally high number of “guests” coming for food and water. There was a huge gray tabby male obviously feral that sometimes had a saucy little female kitten with him. (When I set the traps for TNR I found that there were actually two identical males and the little girl had attached herself to one.) I had a badly injured and emaciated wolf hybrid. I had two Maine coons not yet a year old and almost surely brother and sister and their two kittens. And then there was Fergus. Fergus was bold unlike the feral cats that come around. He didn’t look around but went straight to the food. He had to put his paws on the edge of the large water bowl to boost himself up for a drink. And he wasn’t at all cautious. He was there every day so I assumed he had a home—maybe not a great home but a home so I didn’t try to trap him. He was welcome to the food and water. One morning about 5:30 when it was very dark I heard a cat screaming under my deck. It wasn’t a cat fight; it was just a single cat and it was awful to hear. Fergus didn’t come that day. He showed up two days later looking for food and water. The whole left side of his face was bloody and swollen and his tail was a bloody stump. I thought that if he had had a home he would have already gone there so I set a trap he walked right in and I took him to my vet. I picked him up the next day. The vet had done some work on the torn tail and while Fergus was under anesthesia he gave the little guy a good exam. In addition to what I saw under the fur were deep scratches all along his left side. Our best guess was that a possum had attacked him. I think possum because a raccoon would have finished the job and very thoroughly and a hawk or owl wouldn’t have bitten through his tail. Fergus is now the cat most likely to stomp across my keyboard when I type. The injuries have healed as well as they can but in the picture you can see that his left eye is scrunched down. Sometimes it’s completely closed but most of the time he has use of that eye. And the upper lip on that side is drawn up. The vet thinks it’s nerve damage. But Fergus doesn’t know there’s anything unusual about his appearance. He just knows he loves being cuddled. This is an open thread.
