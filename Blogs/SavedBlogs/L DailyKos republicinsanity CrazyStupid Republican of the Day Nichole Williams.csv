L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Nichole Williams, republicinsanity, 2021-05-01, Welcome to what is the 982nd profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Nichole Williams who was a 2020 candidate for U.S. House of Representatives in Tennessee’s 1st Congressional District looking to fill the shoes of Republican Congressman Phil Roe who was retiring. In September of 2019 she made quote a name for herself by sharing a post of herself at a Civil War re-enactment proudly wearing a Sons of the Confederacy jacket that also featured a “Ride with Forrest” patch referencing specifically the Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest who would go on to found the motherf***ing Ku Klux Klan. Predictably though as Republicans will do Williams insisted that the very racist thing she did wasn’t racist at all:             ”Ride with Forrest isn’t racist. It is recognizing that he was the master of the saddle during the civil war.”       This only was the tip of the iceberg as throughout her candidacy Nichole Williams also was promoting the Qanon conspiracyrepeatedly using hashtags for it in the majority of her posts claiming “We are the news now” and calling herself “the anti-AOC”.Nichole Williams finished eighth out of a possible sixteen candidates who were vying for the seat to represent Tennessee’s 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. It wasn’t because of the Qanon or Neo-Confederate business that hurt her credibility with the Tennessee GOP… it was that she hadn’t voted Republican reliably enough for their tastes because she hadn’t voted in a few prior elections. That’s it. That’s all they took issue with. Not the actual racism or conspiracy-mongering.Because that’s what gets you ahead in today’s GQP.       One Year Ago May 1st 2020: Bobby Jeffries (PA)Two Years Ago May 1st 2019: Lou Barletta (PA)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago May 1st 2018: Lou Barletta (PA)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago May 1st 2017: Lou Barletta (PA)… 2017 UpdateFive Years Ago.
