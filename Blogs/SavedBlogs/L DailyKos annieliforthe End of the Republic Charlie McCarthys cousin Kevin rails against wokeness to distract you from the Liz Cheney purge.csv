L, Charlie McCarthy's cousin Kevin rails against 'wokeness' to distract you from the Liz Cheney purge, annieliforthe End of the Republic, 2021-05-04, GQP the “radical cult that used to be a political party” now attacks “wokeness” to divert attention from their retribution for Liz Cheney’s vote against previous guy during the insurrection. Rep. Kevin McCarthy: "The movement in this country about wokeness has got to stop." pic.twitter.com/Vnrkm0N1bx   That House Republicans appear to stand with serial liar insurrectionist defender Trump lackey Kevin McCarthy over very conservative supporter of truth and the Constitution @Liz_Cheney tells us all we need to know about a radical cult that used to be a political party. #GOPCult  @kadiagoba w/ a great scoop"I've had it with her": McCarthy caught on hot mic trashing Liz Cheney https://t.co/SwGjt249se  What he's saying: "I think she's got real problems" McCarthy told Steve Doocy off-air ahead of a live "Fox and Friends" interview. "I've had it with ... I've had it with her. You know I've lost confidence. ... Well someone just has to bring a motion but I assume that will probably take place." Why it matters: To date McCarthy has left some of his more pointed criticisms to his lieutenants but this firmly puts him on the record — even if it was accidental. www.axios.com/...  Liz Cheney’s impending fall shows us how afraid Republicans are of their base @paulwaldman1 writes https://t.co/ho15nNlBzA  Until a few years ago Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) was known primarily for two things: feuding with her own sister over the issue of gay marriage and being the guardian of her father’s foreign policy legacy especially its conviction that there are few problems in the world that cannot be solved with an invasion by the U.S. military. But today Cheney’s willingness to stand up for a couple of basic principles — principles that in a sane party would be so self-evident as to not even require discussion — has her on the threshold of being purged from the GOP or at least from her position in the House Republican leadership. One need not weep for her fate to understand that it illustrates something very dark about her party something that will continue to characterize it for at least the near future — especially through the 2024 presidential election. While there are other Republicans who acknowledge the fact that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election what distinguishes Cheney is that she has been doing so vocally and voluntarily reiterating not just that undermining U.S. elections is a bad thing but that it’s also bad for Republican officeholders to continually lie to their constituents. That she does this as the third-ranking member of the GOP House leadership is deeply offensive to those of her colleagues most in thrall to Donald Trump. [...] www.washingtonpost.com/...  Senior House Republican member just told me: "Liz is gone. Just a question of how and when." A vote could happen as soon as May 12 - and that seems increasingly likely. https://t.co/Gh1RCNcT8d  "The Republican Party seems to be spending a lot of blood sweat and tears on where they stand and what they stand for and that is their prerogative" -- Psaki on Liz Cheney pic.twitter.com/WsIjBpOqHc  NEW 👀 https://t.co/X2KBZJYBlk   Mr. Barr's DOJ.
