L, Fox News Erases Their Own Promotion Of Sidney Powell's Lies, Frances Langum, 03-25-21, What a difference a multi-million dollar lawsuit makes.   Fox News and their "straight news" division hosted Sidney Powell and her Dominion lies multiple times in the wake of the 2020 election. Don't get me started about loons like Huckabee and the now-canceled Lou Dobbs:   Last night on Fox Bret Baier looked at the camera with a straight-news face and reported that Powell had walked back her “allegations of voter fraud.”   Baier failed to mention Fox's continuous promotion of Powell and her claims throughout the month of December leading up to the January 6 sedition riot.   From the March 23 2021 edition of Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier via Media Matters:   Sidney Powell's defense of "no reasonable person would believe me" essentially throws Fox News NewsMax and OANN—who are also in Dominion's crosshairs—under the bus... since those outlets uncritically repeated many of her claims without performing any sort of due diligence. — Pé (@4everNeverTrump) March 24 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
