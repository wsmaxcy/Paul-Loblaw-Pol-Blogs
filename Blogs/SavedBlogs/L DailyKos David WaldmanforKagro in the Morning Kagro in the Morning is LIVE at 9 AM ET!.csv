L, Kagro in the Morning is LIVE at 9 AM ET!, David WaldmanforKagro in the Morning, 2021-04-29,  Well I understand there was a big speech last night. And that it went pretty much as expected! Which is usually the case with these things except we usually have Greg Dworkin with us the day after in the role of guy-who-watched-the-speech. I couldn’t even watch people watching it on Twitter as I usually do. But luckily for us Twitter more or less repeats itself for anywhere between a couple of hours to a full day so I’m thinking I’ll catch up before too long. Besides there’s always plenty of unexpected fodder out there as well. You never know where the day may lead. Like your home could be raided by the FBI for instance!
