L, Kagro in the Morning is LIVE at 9 AM ET!, David WaldmanforKagro in the Morning, 2021-04-28,  If you were marking the passing of days during the pandemic by measuring time between Greg Dworkin appearances on the show now is the time to stop! Greg is “both sides-ing” the Wednesday issue today. Last week he was on the show on Wednesday. This week he’s not! Both sides! Very centrist! But don’t worry.

So buckle up for what will almost certainly be a disproportionate amount of “optics” reporting tomorrow. Listen right here at 9:00 AM ET! Even more ways to listen live or by podcast below the fold.
