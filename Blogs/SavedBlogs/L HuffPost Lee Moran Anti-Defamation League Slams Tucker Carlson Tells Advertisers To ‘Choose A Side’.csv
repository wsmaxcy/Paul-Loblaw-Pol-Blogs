L, Anti-Defamation League Slams Tucker Carlson Tells Advertisers To ‘Choose A Side’, Lee Moran, 2021-04-21, The Anti-Defamation League is calling on advertisers to “choose a side” when it comes to buying spots on social media “problematic programs” and “networks that don’t respect all people or that repeat baseless conspiracies that endanger all of us.” In a speech Tuesday to the World Federation of Advertisers Jonathan Greenblatt the ADL’s national director singled out Fox News’ Tucker Carlson for particular scorn following Carlson’s pushing of the white supremacist “great replacement” conspiracy theory.   Carlson this month suggested Democrats are trying to replace the electorate with “more obedient voters from the Third World.” Greenblatt at the time called on Fox News to fire Carlson — its most-watched prime time personality. Fox News chiefs dismissed the demand. On Tuesday Greenblatt encouraged advertisers to hit companies that allow hate speech where it hurts — on their bottom lines. “Through your advertising muscle you have a distinct and powerful voice in what information networks like Fox and Facebook will and will not allow on their platforms” Greenblatt told members of the marketing trade group. “You can hold them accountable like few other actors in society because your dollars are the fuel that enables their business model.” The advertising industry was “uniquely positioned to push these networks – whether mass media or social media – to do their utmost to ensure that hatred and conspiracy theories are not amplified” he continued. “Commit to this fight. Choose a side” added Greenblatt. “Choose to pause or even pull your ads not just from problematic programs but altogether from networks that don’t respect all people or that repeat baseless conspiracies that endanger all of us.” Carlson and other Fox News personalities have been the subjects of advertiser boycotts in the past for their hate-filled commentary but Fox News said most of those ads simply moved to other programs on the network.
