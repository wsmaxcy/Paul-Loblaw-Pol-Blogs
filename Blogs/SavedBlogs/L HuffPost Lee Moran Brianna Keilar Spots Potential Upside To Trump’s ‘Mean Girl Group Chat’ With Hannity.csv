L, Brianna Keilar Spots Potential Upside To Trump’s ‘Mean Girl Group Chat’ With Hannity, Lee Moran, 2021-04-20, CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday poked fun at former President Donald Trump for regurgitating his “greatest hits” of complaints during an interview with Fox News personality Sean Hannity. The “New Day” co-anchor slammed Hannity’s show as “propaganda hour” and berated the pair for pushing conspiracy theories. “This is what they discuss literally from a retirement home in Florida” she said. However Keilar did find one possible upside from the conversation. “If there is anything newsworthy from this mean girl group chat it is Donald Trump telling his skeptical supporters whose vaccine hesitancy may prevent the U.S. from reaching herd immunity in the mass casualty way to get vaccinated” she said. Trump and former first lady Melania Trump reportedly quietly got vaccinated in January and were criticized for not talking publicly about getting their shots. Polling has indicated that Republicans are more hesitant to get a COVID-19 vaccine than Democrats.  Watch the video here:
