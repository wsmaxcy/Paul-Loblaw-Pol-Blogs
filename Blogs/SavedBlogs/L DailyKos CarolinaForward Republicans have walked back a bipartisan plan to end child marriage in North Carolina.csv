L, Republicans have walked back a bipartisan plan to end child marriage in North Carolina, CarolinaForward, 2021-04-29, At 14 years old most kids are in 8th or 9th grade. They’re still a solid two years away from driving are just in the midst of puberty and legally drinking a beer is still a distant dream. North Carolina is one of only two states (Alaska being the other) where children as young as 14 can still legally marry. And many do — since 2000 over 4000 marriages involving a minor have been recorded (the country’s #4th highest rate). This year a bipartisan group of state lawmakers came together to change this outdated law and bring the legal age of marriage in our state up to 18. It seemed to have solid support to pass — until Wednesday when one of the bill’s primary sponsors in the State Senate Danny Britt (R-Columbus Robseson) introduced an amendment that largely voided the content of the bill: Under Britt’s amendment children as young as 14 can still marry but only someone four years older or less. The marriage would need to be approved by a parent or guardian with written notice given to the clerk of court unless the minor is emancipated. The bill would also allow children over 14 who become pregnant or have a child to marry the father. A judge must rule however that the marriage is in the best interest of the children. Credit: News & Observer Democratic co-sponsors are livid as are the activist organizations who’ve fought for passage of such a law: “After substantial revisions by Senate leadership the bill in its current form falls far short of progress and will continue to put children in North Carolina and increasingly neighboring states at risk of exploitation under the guise of marriage and other devastating lifelong harms” Casey Carter Swegman with the Tahirih Justice Center which opposes child marriage said in a written statement. Swegman said the amended bill “maintains the most concerning aspects of North Carolina’s current law while simply tinkering around the edges in an attempt to appear meaningful.” Once again this bill was carefully constructed in good faith and had broad bipartisan support. This amendment completely shattered all of that work. The way things work in North Carolina’s state legislature this means that someone in the powerful Senate Leader Phil Berger’s office changed their mind. Orders were sent to kneecap this bill. We’re not sure just who the “child marriage lobby” is who persuaded the Republicans to roll it back — but we’re investigating. Yet another painful setback for North Carolina’s children and families.
