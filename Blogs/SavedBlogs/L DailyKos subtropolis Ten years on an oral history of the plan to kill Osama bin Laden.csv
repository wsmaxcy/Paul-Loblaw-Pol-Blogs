L, Ten years on an oral history of the plan to kill Osama bin Laden, subtropolis, 2021-04-30, On the eve of the ten-year anniversary of the death of bin Laden Politico has published a gripping oral history featuring the words of those who were involved with deliberating planning and conducting the tight-lipped and high-stakes operation which culminated on May 1 2011.   The bin Laden raid that President Obama greenlit that Friday in late April—code-named Operation Neptune’s Spear—was the culmination of months of intricate preparation that reached across the capital and around the globe from full-scale SEAL dress rehearsals in North Carolina to deep Washington legal debates over whether the mission would be “kill or capture” all planned around a small precise physical model of the Abbottabad compound that traveled back and forth from CIA headquarters in suburban Virginia to the West Wing. The tense moments as the raid unfolded half a world away yielded one of the most famous inside-the-room photographs in presidential history Pete Souza’s portrait of 14 people crammed into a White House Situation Room anteroom—a moment of high drama that included Joe Biden Hillary Clinton and two future current Cabinet secretaries. The full story of how and why America’s top security officials decided to pull the trigger that night in May has never been told. This oral history—the story inside the West Wing and U.S. intelligence agencies as Neptune’s Spear coalesced over the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011—is based on extensive original interviews with nearly 30 key intelligence and national security leaders White House staff and presidential aides—including some who have never spoken publicly before and roughly half of those pictured in Souza’s famous photograph. Their accounts from the White House CIA headquarters and Afghanistan itself paint a never-before-seen view of the most momentous decision of Barack Obama’s presidency. I’m not going to say much else nor include any other quotes as there’s simply too much to choose from. Go read.  Garrett M. Graff is a journalist historian and author most recently of the New York Times bestseller The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11. He is now at work on a history of Watergate.  I will add that I’ve read that earlier oral history as well. Much recommended!
