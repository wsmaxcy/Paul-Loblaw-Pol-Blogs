L, Yellowstone Lake, OjibwaforStreet Prophets, 2021-05-08, Welcome to the Street Prophets Coffee Hour cleverly hidden at the intersection of religion and politics. This is an open thread where we can share our thoughts and comments about the day. Let’s start off with by  looking at Yellowstone Lake. Yellowstone Lake is located in the eastern edge of the Yellowstone Caldera the mammoth depression formed by the collapse of ground after a volcanic explosion about 640000 years ago. The lake has 141 miles of shoreline (only a portion is accessible by road) and covers about 131 square miles. It is more than 400 feet deep. For more than 11000 years Native Americans camped on the shores of Yellowstone Lake and used the area as a rendezvous site for Indian people from the Great Plains the Rocky Mountains the Great Basin and the Pacific Northwest.               This is an open thread—all topics are welcome.
