L, Meanwhile Blue State Illinois Is EXPANDING Medicaid Again, Frances Langum, 2021-07-07, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  While Republican governors turn off extra unemployment benefits and refuse Biden's offer on expanding Medicaid Illinois is making Medicaid more generous and easier to get.   Democratic Governor JB Pritzker announced Tuesday that expanded Medicaid benefits will last until he declares the Covid emergency in the state over PLUS one year.   “Healthcare is a human right" said Pritzker at the signing ceremony. "Here in Illinois we won’t stop until everyone can access all aspects of it. In recognition of the pandemic that we continue to live in this legislation expands emergency Medicaid coverage for many months to come. That means Illinoisans who suddenly found themselves in need of Medicaid coverage in the face of COVID-19 won’t find the rug pulled out from under them just because our lives are starting to feel a bit more ‘normal.’”  The Springfield (IL) State Journal-Register (paywall) reports that under this new law Illinois will: Last year at this time Pritzker suspended all premium and co-pays for any Medicaid recipients in the Workers with Disabilities (HBWD) Veterans Care (VC) and All Kids Share and Premium programs until the COVID state of emergency is declared over.   And those children "aging out" of Medicaid at age 19 will stay on the program until further notice.  With all the horrible news coming out of states with Republican Governors it's great to hear that a Democratic governor in the Midwest with a Democratic legislature is expanding healthcare during this time of crisis. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
