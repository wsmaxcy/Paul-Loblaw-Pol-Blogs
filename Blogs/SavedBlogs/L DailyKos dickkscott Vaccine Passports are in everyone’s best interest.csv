L, Vaccine Passports are in everyone’s best interest, dickkscott, 2021-04-26, If I had a physical store I would absolutely require that anyone wanting to enter without a face mask would have to show that they’ve been vaccinated against Covid. (I’m even more strict when it comes to my home: double face mask gloves and shoe covers. Face shield too if you can swing it and/or I have an extra.) I have a moral and ethical obligation to ensure the health well-being and safety of myself my employees and my customers. The same goes for weapons. I don’t care if you have a permit from the State to carry a gun open or concealed. In my store no guns no knives no weapons of any kind are allowed. My store my rules. Also I’m not so selfish that I don’t give a flying flip about anyone else.  I know I’m not the only one. This will be our new reality for quite some time. And anyone who wants to equate Vaccine Passports or whatever we collectively decide to call them as the same thing as in Nazi Germany or Communist countries with their “Show me your papers” bullshit and gold Stars of David needs to get a grip on reality. Proving that you’ve been vaccinated to gain entry into a public space is in no way the same thing as proving your identity ethnicity and religious affiliation to a thug authority. It is however the same banal thing as so many schools require prove that your child has been vaccinated against various serious and deadly diseases otherwise they can’t set foot in the school.  It’s the same thing as showing proof of age to get into bar or buy liquor at the store. We’ve all done it and none of us have been harmed (well accept for the first time in your 30’s when you get ID’ed at the grocery checkout for that handle of Jack). In fact I would bet the majority of people think it’s a good thing completely non-intrusive and at the end of the day gives them all peace of mind.  Do I worry that a Vaccine Passport can be abused? Absolutely but as we are reminded daily anything that is a part of who and what we are from skin color to ethnicity from religious affiliation to sexual orientation from gender identity to job title can and will be used against us especially outside a court of law. On the other hand as with a driver’s license possessing a piece of paper (or a digital version) that shows that I’ve been vaccinated just shows other people that I’ve taken the necessary steps to ensure my and other’s health and safety. And just like a driver’s license a Vaccine Passport indicates that I’m more than likely safe to be around. If you knew someone didn’t have a driver’s license and you saw them get behind the wheel and try to drive off what would you do? Call the cops? Try to stop them? I’d try to stop them if I were able. Barring mitigating circumstances I’d call the cops especially if it were a kid or someone I knew was a danger to themselves and others when behind the wheel. Anything else is just selfish.  My biggest concern especially in the near term is that whatever form these Vaccine Passports take (Vaccine Receipts? Vaccine Guarantees? Vaccine IDs?) be it digital paper or a combination of both it will be easy to fake and easy to hack. I do believe though that just like with driver’s licenses or birth certificates there will be ways to authenticate the legitimacy of a person’s vaccination record. As a 20+ year veteran of the tech world I’m an advocate of an analog solution (thanks Facebook!). I do think and I know this is controversial even in my own mind that there will need to be some sort of government involvement in creating legitimate vaccination records (maybe that’s what we call them Vaccination Records). Possibly like a driver’s license it would be issued by the State. Or the record is issued by a doctor hospital pharmacy or the body that oversaw your vaccination but verified by the State. That said I don’t believe the Federal Government should be involved in this at all. Ok with one exception and that would be if and when the various States (I’m looking at you GOP strongholds) face-plant on the rollout. But again if various States and territories can all get on board with driver’s licenses then I don’t see a logical reason as to why they couldn’t coordinate and get on board with Vaccination Records.  Wherever we find ourselves in the next year or two or more realistically five I firmly believe that right now today tomorrow and the next twelve months will see a hodgepodge of requirements formats and issuers. Be ready for multiple apps fractured regulations and remembering which store airline cruise line and restaurant chain requires your vaccination record before entering or boarding. And remember which one wants you to use their app and only their app and which one will take the paper card (laminated or not). It’s going to be a mess but one I’ll be happy to work with in the near future. That said while patience is a virtue mine will only hold out so long. We will need to get to a cohesive workable efficient place both in verified official vaccine records and regulations around when and where you’ll need to show them relatively quickly. Covid-19 isn’t going away and with so many people both here in the US and abroad reluctant and/or outright refusing to get vaccinated it will be in everyone’s best interest if there is an official way to know who’s been vaccinated and if boosters are needed going forward when those were given. The world has changed and if the scientific hunches are correct that Covid-19 isn’t going away anytime soon the change is irrevocable. It’s a new world now let’s work together to figure out how to navigate the new terrain while keeping ourselves loved ones friends neighbors and strangers alike safe and healthy.
