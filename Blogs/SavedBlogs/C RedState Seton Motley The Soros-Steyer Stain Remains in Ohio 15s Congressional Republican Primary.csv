C, The Soros-Steyer Stain Remains in Ohio 15's Congressional Republican Primary, Seton Motley, 2021-06-02, There is currently underway in Ohio’s 15th Congressional district a special election to replace outgoing Republican Representative Steve Stivers. Stivers quit this gig for a new one – president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to gerrymandering the Ohio 15th is an overwhelmingly Republican district.  The 2020 margin of Republican victory was nearly 27%. So the election that matters isn’t the November 2nd general – it’s the August 3rd primary.  Whoever wins the R primary – skates backwards into Congress in the general. So there is an avalanche of Republicans running.  Twelve according to Wikipedia.  And as often happens in these uber-gerrymandered districts some people who shouldn’t be in the Republican primary run in the Republican primary – because it’s their only chance of ending up in DC. To wit: As we noted a fortnight ago…. George Soros Tom Steyer and Their Fellow Radicals Invade a House Republican Primary: “(Brian) Stewart is an alleged Republican state Rep running to be an alleged Republican US Congressman…. “Stewart is a (George) Soros-(Tom) Steyer Republican…. “George Soros: Godfather of the Left: “‘Say the name George Soros and liberals see dollar signs – literally…. “‘(I)nstead of gaining a mighty reputation for his philanthropy or his investment prowess Soros is reviled abroad and criticized here in his adopted country.  Most everywhere Soros his foundations or his investing have gone trouble has followed. He’s helped foment revolutions undermined national currencies and funded radicals around the world.’ “George Soros Emerges as Major Funder of ‘Global Climate Strike’ Groups…. “Steyerville’: Website Tracks Communities Smothered by Radical Environmentalism: “‘A new website is tracking once-thriving communities fallen on hard times due to environmental activism billionaire Tom Steyer funded The Washington Free Beacon reported. “‘Steyerville.com launched Thursday by Power the Future (PTF) a non-profit that advocates the benefits of fossil fuels. The website holds an interactive map displaying the stories of communities in three states smothered by environmental policies. “‘“We started Steyerville to demonstrate the danger the eco-left poses…” PTF Executive Director Daniel Turner told The Free Beacon.’… “Stewart is leading (the Soros-Steyer funded) environmental group (Ohio Conservative Energy Forum).  Proudly so: Here’s his Tweet proudly announcing it. “Well he was proudly leading it.  He’s no longer listed on the website – and hasn’t been since April 2018. “Perhaps because he realized being a Soros-Steyer Republican isn’t such a good idea when planning to run for higher Republican office.” Well Stewart quit the Soros-Steyer environ-mental gig.  But the Soros-Steyer environ-mental gig didn’t quit him. Meet Tyler Duvelius: “Director of External Affairs @ConsEnergyNet/@CCEF4Energy.” For those of you who don’t speak Twitter: @ConsEnergyNet is the Conservative Energy Network (CEN).  And @CCEF4Energy is Conservatives for a Clean Energy Future. It would seem Stewart was Duvelius’ boss in his Soros-Steyer environ-mental gig.  “CEO” certainly trumps “Director of External Affairs.” Both Duvelius gigs are different branches of the same poisonous Soros-Steyer tree – from which Stewart was picking environ-mental fruit. And still is it would appear. Duvelius has twelve Ohio 15 Republican primary challengers from whom to choose.  And he’s chosen Stewart.  Hmmmm….. Here’s a picture of Duvelius posing with other Stewart door knockers – on Stewart’s Facebook page.  Duvelius is third on the left (oh the irony). I have…issues with Stewart’s continued relationship with Duvelius.  It raises questions like: Is there still a Soros-Steyer-Stewart relationship? Is Soros-Steyer money still supporting Stewart? Will Stewart be a Soros-Steyer environ-mental stooge – as a REPUBLICAN – should he win and go to Washington? There are twelve options from whom to choose in the Ohio 15 August primary. Eleven have not had large public and remunerative relationships with George Soros and Tom Steyer. I would think almost any of these eleven would be a better selection than Stewart.
