L, Jim Jordan's Dishonest 'You Choose' Attack On Biden Spectacularly Backfires, Ed Mazza, 2021-04-15, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) tried to get something going on Twitter on Wednesday but the message didn’t exactly take off as he intended.  Jordan attempted to attack President Joe Biden’s tax proposals in a tweet with a glaring omission:  President Biden wants to raise your taxes. Republicans don’t. You choose. Jordan’s message did not mention that the proposal for tax increases applied only to incomes in excess of $400000.  As the Washington Post reported the White House has sent a mixed message on whether that threshold applies to individuals or households ― a key distinction. However Business Insider reported that 98 percent of U.S. households had incomes below $400000 in 2020 with the average household earning $97973. Jordan was immediately called out for implying the tax hike would apply to everyone ― and his “you choose” comment was met with reminders that American voters already made their choice when they selected Biden in last year’s election:  This is very telling from Jim Jordan.He's talking to the people he really works for: his billionaire backers.Jordan *opposed* tax cuts for working families in the American Rescue Plan... but backed a trillion dollar tax giveaway to billionaires. He's not on our side. You’re shilling for people making over $400000 a year. Jim Jordan’s salary is $174000 per year. Not even his taxes would go up under Biden’s plan as only those who make over $400000 would see an increase. #JimJordanIsUseless https://t.co/r22XmSI18x We literally did choose 5 months ago...and said "no" to you. https://t.co/CZYvDSxMXT I’ll choose Biden.I’m not a big fan of sedition.
