L, Andrew Giuliani Defends Daddy Rudy In Bizarre Parking Lot Video, David Moye, 2021-06-24, New York gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani took to Twitter on Thursday to attack the “partisan” New York judges who suspended his father former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani from practicing law. The younger Giuliani defended his dad passionately claiming he “did everything ultimately by the book.” Earlier this hour 5 Leftist judges decided to suspend my father @rudygiuliani’s law license. Here is my statement: pic.twitter.com/A3O0buL6LG But the impassioned video was mocked by Twitter users for various reasons ― like factual inaccuracy. Who wants to tell Rudy Giuliani's son that New York's 1st Court of Appeals isn't part of the Justice Department? https://t.co/LvcsOXcxiy The state bar disciplined Giuliani for violating its ethics rules. It's not politics & DOJ is not involved. But I'm here to see more of this scenic roadstop in the promised multiple statements later today. Wondering if there's a crossover with 4 Seasons Landscaping? https://t.co/JurGkKtUUk Others made fun of the framing of the video which made the younger Giuliani look tiny compared to the parking lot where he inexplicably decided to mount his father’s defense. Honestly the framing of this video making him look like a very small and bratty child is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. https://t.co/qOSMEBryRk Did he film this by putting his phone on the roof of his car? Top-notch staff work the kid's campaign is firing on all cylinders. https://t.co/9PZKizSDZ2 When you don't have any friends to hold the camera so you mount it on...the roof of your car? https://t.co/Yqzc5IUbUe Was the landscaping place booked? Dude shouting about shit in a parking lot. Get the fuck outta here dummy https://t.co/YX1XEX9tBJ Is this what it means to lack standing? https://t.co/Arx2JjlDvc Some people were surprisingly sympathetic to the gubernatorial candidate. Hey man I don't normally do this for people I hate but I can hear the sizzling and beg you to wear sunblock. https://t.co/aN6AIjc5vM One person did have a valuable suggestion about how Giuliani could make his video even more impactful. Can someone put thought balloons of different sandwiches over his head https://t.co/xjDEBRC0Ir
