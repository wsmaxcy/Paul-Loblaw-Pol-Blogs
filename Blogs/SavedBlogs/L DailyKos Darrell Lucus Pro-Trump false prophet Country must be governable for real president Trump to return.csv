L, Pro-Trump false prophet: Country must be 'governable' for 'real president' Trump to return, Darrell Lucus, 2021-04-30, The religious right has insisted publicly that all it wants is a place at the table for evangelicals and others with “traditional values.” That’s a big reason why the nation’s so-called moral guardians pushed white evangelicals into almost otherworldly support for the Messiah Lord Donald Trump The Most Merciful. But lately a good number of them have dropped any pretense of supporting democracy.  Lest you think that this is just hyperbole consider that a number of rabidly pro-Trump charismatic “prophets” have openly declared that Trump will return to office. In other words they are openly calling for Joe Biden to be overthrown. One of the most vocal of these “prophets” is Johnny Enlow. He openly called for a military coup after the Supreme Court turned back last-ditch challenges by the Trump campaign. In Enlow’s telling Trump not Biden is still commander in chief—so if Trump ordered the tanks to roll so he could fly back to Washington from Mar-a-Lago in triumph the commanders would have to obey him. But don’t call it a coup. After all Enlow claims that they’re trying to stop a coup. Supposedly the real coup happened when Biden was declared president-elect. Is your head spinning yet?  Well Enlow took to Facebook with another “prophetic utterance” about Trump—one that contained a not-so-veiled warning to those who dare to oppose their new messiah. He claimed that we are in the midst of an “extreme societal makeover” that would expose a smorgasbord of “lies and deceit.” Part of it involves preparing the way for Trump—in a way that sounds distinctly undemocratic. The awakening pain is necessary so as to mark our generation for the good of future generations. Everything will be known as "before" and "after" these days. Yes the real president will be officially back in his position soon enough but it is necessary that the nation be governable before he comes back in that way. No more ganging up on him by the blatantly evil media and no more relentless impeachment and other elimination attempts by the wicked cabal in Congress the Senate and the Supreme Court. I hope I misunderstand what you mean by “governable” Johnny. I really do. So you’re saying that if the media holds Trump to account this country won’t be “governable”? So if Congress and the courts exercise their constitutional responsibility to act as checks and balances on the president this nation isn’t “governable”? That doesn’t sound like any country where I’d want to live. If it were up to me Enlow and these other Trumpist “prophets” along with everyone who took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection or stirred up the pot before it would be required to sit down and watch Washington D. C. cop Michael Fanone’s entire interview with CNN’s Don Lemon earlier this week.  Every call for Biden to be overthrown and every suggestion that he stole the election from Trump amount to a giant middle finger in the face of Fanone and every other cop who had to endure the horror of Jan. 6. Indeed Enlow is engaging in the very same kind of rhetoric that led to the insurrection. One has to wonder if Enlow is trying to leave himself an out in case Trump doesn’t get back in the White House. Would he be able to say that it was because this country wasn’t “governable”?
