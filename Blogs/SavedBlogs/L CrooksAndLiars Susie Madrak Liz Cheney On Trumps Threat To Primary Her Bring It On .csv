L, Liz Cheney On Trump's Threat To Primary Her: 'Bring It On' , Susie Madrak, 2021-05-13, Liz Cheney talked with NBC's Savannah Guthrie about the Republican embrace of the Big Lie that the presidential election was stolen.  ‚ÄúIt's a scary thing‚Äù she said. She said the vote to oust her was really about whether the Republican party would embrace the truth. ‚ÄúFor reasons that I don't understand leaders in my party have decided to embrace the former president who launched that attack. And I think you've watched over the course of the last several months the former president get more aggressive more vocal pushing the lie.‚Äù And in the understatement of the year she says Kevin McCarthy has not provided "courageous leadership." She said the election lie is an ongoing threat and silence isn't an option. Cheney did not rule out a White House bid. ‚ÄúRight now I am very focused on making sure that our party becomes again a party that stands for truth and stands for fundamental principles that are conservative‚Äù said Cheney. She came out strong for a bipartisan commission on Jan. 6 that focuses only on the events leading up to the insurrection and not BLM and antifa as Republicans have urged.  "And I think that that kind of intense narrow focus threatens people in my party who may have been playing a role they should not have been playing" she noted. She said Trump ‚Äúmust not ever again be anywhere close to the Oval Office.‚Äù  There's something we can all agree on! Why does Savannah continually called Donald Trump ‚Äú the President‚Äù on this interview while Liz Cheney corrects her by calling him rightfully the former president... ?? ‚Äî Howard Mills (@millslt1) May 13 2021 In an interview with NBC News Cheney said it was necessary for the #DOJ to uncover the full truth about the events leading up to the deadly January 6th riots at the Capitol even if that meant charging the former president with #crimes. https://t.co/XvaKZfT07X ‚Äî CrystalWolfLady üò∑ (@CWL97010129) May 13 2021 Cheney got about 3 weeks of MSM coverage 3 weeks of telling everyone Trump lied & continues to lie. Happily tho MSM never needed to interview Trump - Never appeared on screen. His twitter is cancelled. Cheney accomplished what she intended to accomplish  https://t.co/xJ1gqCFG5X ‚Äî Francis Muldoon (@Francis_Muldoon) May 13 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
