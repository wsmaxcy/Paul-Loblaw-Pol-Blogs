L, IAN:  July 4 2021 -  Please no fireworks, loggersbratforItzl Alert Network, 2021-07-03,   As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos.  It's also so we can find other Kossacks nearby for in-person checks when other methods of communication fail - a buddy system. Members come here to check in.  If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we and your buddy are going to check up on you.  If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here.  We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries.  Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime!  We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group!  Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! ************************* Research is being done on how different diseases affect chances of contracting something else.  Fascinating. There’s a shipwreck been confirmed by archaeologists in Antigua.  It’s a couple hundred years old and may be the only one if its kind in the world. Everybody wants to rule the world.  I’ve always loved this song — this is a really good version though I do think I prefer the original one. The oldest wine in Europe has just been discovered in Greece. Somebody’s burning Catholic churches in Canada.  Evidence is believed to indicate it’s connected to the mass graves being found. A review of a new edition of The Anatomy of Melancholy. Sounds fascinating actually. This is our weatherdude that was.  Of current DAMWeather fame.  An article on measuring temperatures published in Forbes. ************************* Monday was a degree or two hotter than the original forecast.  Tuesday temperatures plunged into the 90s.  I spent last Saturday Sunday and Monday in wet t-shirts.  Don’t laugh — it worked.  Wednesday turned out cloudy and mid-80s if that warm.   My computer still hasn’t entirely recovered from the heat.  It took me about a dozen tries to finally get here to add to this (on Tuesday).  I think I really will have to replace it soon.  I have in fact made plans to replace it next week.  I can afford it — the one I have is getting on for elderly — the new version has the new chip — the one I have can’t cope with the new iteration of Safari — I can afford it.  You get the picture I think.  I’m also getting a new modem; what the tech did when I called in about the one I have apparently solved some problem but still — the one I have is so old it still says Qwest and CenturyLink hasn’t been Qwest for several years. I have discovered that summer is a good time for me to buy cookies.  Heat does a number on my appetite so they last a lot longer. I bought a license for Delicious Monster’s library app a while back.  Something fried the version I had and it wouldn’t let me use the camera to enter any of my new books.  Just got an update and the camera feature is working again.  It’s not letting me use the camera on books I’ve entered by hand which strikes me as weird but anything new no problem. My new mattress was delivered Saturday.  I’ll give you a report on it in a few weeks. ************************* I read some of the science articles on DailyKos.  Fairly regularly actually.  The latest that I read was the July 1st Top Comments which led up to the top comments with some commentary about the science of how planets are detected.   Several years back — exactly how many I’ve forgotten though I do recall I was still working — something came up in the news about several new discoveries in astronomy.  Somebody I knew at work knew I would be enthusiastic and started talking to me about it when we happened across each other.  At some point in the discussion of how marvelous all this was he asked me if it didn’t make me feel insignificant.  No it didn’t.  I never have figured out why it should. ************************* The comments were giving me fits on Saturday so I thought I would address this here.  I was trying to answer the question if you had five minutes to get out what would you take?   Five minutes:  My wallet my computer my box with the REALLY important papers and my best pair of boots.  With ten minutes I’d add a couple changes of clothes a week’s worth of underwear and any hardcopy library books. *************************
