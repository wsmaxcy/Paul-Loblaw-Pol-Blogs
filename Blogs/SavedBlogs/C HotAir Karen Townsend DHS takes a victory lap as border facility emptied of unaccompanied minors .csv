C, DHS takes a victory lap as border facility emptied of unaccompanied minors , Karen Townsend, 2021-05-05, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is touting an empty facility in Donna Texas as proof that the administration has a handle on the border crisis. But the surge of unaccompanied minors being detained at the southern border hasn’t ended and the children are being moved from one detention facility to others. The Biden administration is becoming more adept at moving the children out of temporary custody on the border. Don’t be fooled into thinking that this is a sign that the border is under control. The flood of migrants arriving at the southern border continues. The Biden administration was called out by politicians in March when they were finally able to tour a facility in Donna Texas that was extremely overcrowded with unaccompanied minors. Video filmed during a visit from several Republican lawmakers including Senators Cruz and Cornyn at the facility showed the horror of children crammed together covered with foil emergency blankets. At the time a Biden administration staffer tried to stop the filming inside the facility. How far is Joe Biden going to stop the American people from seeing inside the Donna CBP facility? Biden sent a political operative from DC to block our cameras and even threatened another senator to obstruct legitimate congressional oversight. pic.twitter.com/vHT2U7Nh1z — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 28 2021  DHS Secretary Mayorkas showed photos of empty ‘pods’ that formerly held the children who were packed in shoulder to shoulder.  The Department of Homeland Security announced that as of Saturday there were just 677 children in CBP custody an 88% drop from March 28 when more than 5700 children were in custody. The presentation by DHS included a series of before-and-after photos of a processing facility in Donna Texas. “In March we faced a critical challenge at our border” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “The men and women if DHS have been working tirelessly over the past several weeks to respond and rebuild. Their efforts have produced dramatic results – results that ensure the safety and security of both the migrants we encounter and the American people.” The pods in Donna may be empty now but it is because the children have been moved out of the facility and into ones operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The children are required to be moved from border patrol facilities into HHS facilities and the Biden administration is even moving them onto military bases for housing. DHS is so desperate to move the unaccompanied minors away from the border that it is paying travel expenses for sponsors to come for the children many of whom are illegal migrants themselves.  The numbers continue to increase regardless of what the White House press secretary says and who she blames for the crisis. Jen Psaki continues to gaslight the press corps that it was the Trump administration’s policies that created the flood of migrants rushing to the southern border.  .@PressSec says that the influx of immigrants at the southern border is "something that began during and was something that was exacerbated by the Trump administration." pic.twitter.com/iacLlRwxVg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 4 2021  A quick look at numbers provided by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shows that Psaki is living in an alternative reality. For example in October 2020 while Trump was still in office the number of encounters between border patrol agents and illegal migrants is listed as 71945. In March 2021 the number is listed as 172331. The number of encounters began to rise as migrants took Joe Biden seriously as he declared he would end deportations and deliver on a promise of issuing blanket amnesty for millions of illegal migrants living in the United States. It continues today despite Psaki’s happy talk.  “The amount of time children spend in CBP custody is down 75 percent from 131 hours at the end of March to under 30 hours now” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. “Clearly we’re not done there is a lot of work ahead” she added. Officials at the border encountered more than 172000 migrants in March including a historic number of unaccompanied children. Those numbers appear set to have stayed the same in April. Where’s Kamala? Shouldn’t she have been available to talk about the shift of unaccompanied minors from one large detention facility into other facilities? She is supposed to be the border czar after all. Kamala you may not be surprised to learn is blaming the crisis at the border on climate change. Because of course she is.  Kamala Harris called "the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience" some of the "root causes of migration." pic.twitter.com/gz2LAGRlvC — DaybreakInsider (@DaybreakInsider) May 5 2021  She says she is more concerned with working on the root causes of illegal migration. She is in favor of sending millions of dollars in aid to Northern Triangle countries. That is a status quo solution that was used for decades with little success. Trump ended much of the aid and chose to work with the governments of the countries to help control the flow of people to the border. In order to own Trump the Biden administration wants to go back to what wasn’t working instead of keeping policies and agreements in place that were working especially the Remain-in-Mexico policy.  Noting that the residents of Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala are “our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere” Harris said the US needs to help them.  She said she’s met with cabinet officials including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield and foreign leaders about investing in the Northern Triangle countries.  “So this is the work that we need to do. It will not be fixed overnight. Look if this were easy it would have been fixed a long time ago. It’s not a new issue. But we are prepared to make the investment and to get in there for the long haul to do what is necessary to address the reasons people flee” she said.  When a Democrat talks about investments hold on to your wallet. The solution to every problem is always to throw more taxpayer money at it regardless of the effectiveness of doing so. Kamala even randomly mentioned Ireland and Finland as two countries with whom she has reached out for help with Northern Triangle countries. You can’t make this stuff up. If she is serious about border security and the humanitarian crisis at the border which is questionable she should simply take a trip to border states and see the situation for herself. She should travel to the southern border in Texas and Arizona in particular. Otherwise no one should take her seriously. The illegal migrants do not.
