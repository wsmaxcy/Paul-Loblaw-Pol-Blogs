L, King Floyd 30 Years and What's Changed?, hughwill, 2021-04-21, “Relieved” not “hopeful” seems to be the most widely reported feeling following the Derek Chauvin verdict. With our history why should any of us hope things will now somehow be better? The savage Rodney King beating thirty years ago should have been a wake-up call for those of us who had been raised with the “white privilege” of being actually “served and protected” by our police officers. We may have written that incident off as “a few bad apples” in police ranks. But others of us (poor folk and people of color) for generations have known the truth. The problems with America’s police then (and now) are systemic. It’s far more than just “a few bad apples”. There are so many threads that run together to cause where we are today. Racism and “white supremacy” attitudes in the ranks is one factor. An increased emphasis on recruiting ex-military with their “Shoot first and live to go home” attitude (even if possibly justified in a combat situation) is a problem when people should be “assumed innocent until proven guilty”. Solidarity in the “Thin Blue Line” an unwillingness to speak out against fellow officers’ misbehaviors is yet another. While “Defund the Police” is a nice sound bite it is no real solution. But if not that then what? For starters we need to be able to hold our police officers accountable. And this requires several things: - First eliminating (or at least sharply restricting) “qualified immunity” statutes and related policies so police officers can be held accountable for their actions; - Second dramatically restricting the power of police Unions to keep bad apples on the force; (Just yesterday the Boston “Globe” newspaper reported how “investigators believed one of their officers had sexually abused a child but under pressure from the union the officer was allowed to keep his badge and return to patrol … The officer Patrick M. Rose Sr. who served as head of the police patrolmen’s union would would go on to abuse five more children”). - Third open and accessible data on prior incidents when police officers have behaved badly. With over ten thousand police departments in America who don’t share such information It is all too easy for an officer fired for cause by one department to get employed by another nearby. Perhaps even more important than specific changes such as these to try to change current “police culture” and the systemic problems with policing in America however is the willingness of people like me to be aware that there are real problems that need to be fixed and for us to collectively keep the pressure on our political leaders city managers and police departments to see that the needed changes actually happen. As Denise Oliver Velez notes “www.dailykos.com/…  “Chauvin is convicted but the system is still guilty of killing us — by any means they choose”. Those of us who have actually enjoyed police protection can no longer claim “we didn’t know”.
