L, What are you reading?  April 29 2021, Chitown KevforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-04-30, In WAYR? I note what I’m reading and comment...you note what you are reading and comment. Occasionally I may add a section or a link related to books…been studying for a final in one of my online classes that I will take this weekend...no time to do much reading outside of all of these insanely detailed foreign policy writings (which are very interesting!)  I am reading: Rod Serling: His Life Work and Imagination by Nicholas Parisi  The Jameses: A Family Narrative by R.W.B. Lewis  7:14 am: Well...OK...I changed my mind...I’ll give you the titles of my foreign policy reads to this point. Not liking the white space here. New players New Game? The Impact of Emerging Economies on Global Governance by The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies and TNO- A slightly antiquated study  of “The BRICS.” (BRICS) = Brazil Russia India China South Africa Structural Realism after the Cold War by Kenneth Waltz- Basically structural realist IR theory guru Kenneth Waltz barking back that the structural realist theory of international relations is not obsolete after all. The Promise of Institutionalist Theory by Robert O. Keohane and Lisa L. Martin- Basically a catty response to John J. Mearsheimer’s deriding of global institutions. Bridging the Realist/Constructivist Divide: The Case of the Counterrevolution in Soviet Foreign Policy at the End of the Cold War by Robert Snyder: This is the most fascinating paper of them all: A brilliant narrative of how Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev flipped Soviet domestic and foreign policy on its head.     TIME EST/EDT (LAST SUN OF THE MONTH) 7:30 AM You Can't Read That!    or Paul's Book Reviews
