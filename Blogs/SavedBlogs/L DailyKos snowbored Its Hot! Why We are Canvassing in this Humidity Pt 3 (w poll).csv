L, It's Hot! Why We are Canvassing in this Humidity: Pt 3 (w/ poll), snowbored, 2021-06-30, (this is a third diary in a series about summer make-up field work; the first is here and the second is here) Why would anyone be out in this heat?  We’ve heard that a lot last weekend.  Hope Springs from Field PAC canvassed in five states on Saturday and Sunday:  Florida Georgia North Carolina Pennsylvania and Texas.  Everywhere we went we got comments about the weather.  But there is a lot of work to be done especially in light of re-districting and all the voter suppression laws Republicans are eager to enact. This diary continues to outline the reasons why we are knocking on doors listening to voters and making sure they are in compliance for the new laws that have already been signed into law (hello Georgia (is there a thumbs down emoji?) in the middle of this heat and humidity.  The Democratic electorate is a lot more casual in off-presidential years and this time we really can’t afford them to be.  So we are trying to remind our voters they have good reasons to come out and vote for Democrats up and down the ballot in 2022. We don't know what the final Democratic message will be for 2022 but that doesn't mean we can't leave positive impression and build up the brand.  At the door we talk about Democrats Care! and We Do Big Things!  Every town virtually every block has infrastructure needs as well as other constituent needs to be addressed. But our biggest focus has been on making sure people were registered to vote at their current address and were aware of any other requirements they may face in order to cast their ballot or even request an absentee in 2022.  Helping people understand the photo identification requirements is key.  We want to make sure that voters understand how these new laws effect them. Republicans have used the offer of a free Voter Identification Card (and acceptance of expired driver's licenses) as a reason that their new ID requirements aren't onerous.  But the fact is that people who don't have identification with a photo on it aren't generally aware of these requirements (something I learned in person meaning from a Georgia voter in the Senate special election).  What is more even though Republicans argued that only 3% of current Georgia voters did not have a DL number on file they would not fund a special mailing to those voters (who did not have one on file and thus probably didn't have one) to inform them of the new requirement nor would they include language in their bill (now law) to release that information to the public.  One state House Democrat noted that 89% of those people were African-American. The offer of a free photo ID that would qualify voters to vote (in person or to request an absentee ballot) is used prominently to defend this legislation in court.  It's not an issue they say because anyone can get the required ID at their local county registrar's office.  Think about that.  Because we did. One of our volunteers asked the Dougherty County registrar's office how many Voter Identification Cards they have issued.  The answer was zero.  But that wasn't all.  This young activist (student attending Albany State) also learned that at that time the registrar's office did not have the means or materials to issue any.  We've begun to schedule set days for voters to get free voter id's in the Black Belt of Georgia.  We have already set up a date in Dougherty County and the registrar's office has agreed to 4 more additional dates for this year.  But there is a method to our madness. We don't think the Dougherty County registrar's office is unique here.  And if we can establish a pattern that the promise of a "free Voter Identification Card" is an empty promise we can not only take evidence of this to the Garland Justice Department but that finding can be used to help strike down the law in court. This is why we are canvassing. We aren't just looking for people who need free Voter Identification Cards we are encouraging anyone who cares about this voter suppression law in Georgia to get one.  One of the concerns we have is that the act of asking for a free Voter Identification Card will be stigmatizing set them apart.  Embarrass them and allow public servants to shame them because they can’t fulfill a legal request.  Jim Crow stuff.  In training volunteers to canvass in Georgia we note that the entire process of sending identifying information through the mail is not safe and could open people up to identification theft.  But who could use a free Voter ID Card to obtain a credit card or open a bank account?  We are asking Democratic elected officials in Georgia to get obtain Voter ID cards; we are asking Democratic and progressive activists to get them.  We are asking Black Church congregants to get them -- we are asking everyone to get them! Hope Springs from Field PAC is knocking on doors in a grassroots-led effort to increase awareness of the fact that Democrats care about our voters and are working to protect their rights.  We are thinking how to mitigate Voter Suppression efforts get around them and make sure we have "super compliance" helping our voters meet the requirements and get out and vote.  We are taking those efforts to the doors of the communities most effected (the intended targets or victims) of these new voter suppression laws. Obviously we rely on grassroots support so if you support field/grassroots organizing and our efforts to protect our voters we would certainly appreciate your support: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/voterprotection Hope Springs from Field PAC was started by former Obama Field Organizers because field was the cornerstone of our success.  The approach we adopted was focused on listening on connecting voters and their story to the candidate.  Repeated face to face interactions are critical.  And we are among those who believe that Democrats didn’t do as well in the 2020 Congressional races as expected because we didn’t knock on doors.  We are returning to the old school basics: repeated contacts repeated efforts to remind them of protocols meeting them were they are.  Mentoring those who need it (like first time and newly registered voters). Georgia Republicans argued that they were safe-guarding the integrity of and faith in elections -- even though they claimed to have the safest and most secure elections ever in 2020.  We are testing the validity of that claim. Georgia Republicans also slipped in a little discussed aspect into the new law:   Training provided by the political party political body or candidate designating the poll watcher is a prerequisite for qualifying for or being appointed a poll watcher. Those responsible for designating poll watchers must attest to their training under oath. On it's face this seems to be a no brainer.  Poll watchers should be trained.  And Republicans are already training people to act as aggressive assertive poll watchers for 2022.  True the Vote and the Leadership Institute have already started to train conservatives and Trumpists to qualify as poll watchers.  There is nothing like that on our side.  And campaigns won't tend to think about meeting this new qualification until the few months or so (when they plan out GOTV). But the Obama alumni have a wealth of former staffers who have trained volunteers in Election Protection.  And we are organizing them to provide similar virtual on-demand training videos that will allow Democrats to meet this qualification as well. None of this negates the need to oppose these laws in federal efforts or through the courts.  Contacting voters throughout the election cycle is just good politics and this gives us another reason -- and incentive -- to do so.   If you support grassroots efforts to protect the vote and our voters especially in minority communities please give if you are able: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/voterprotection
