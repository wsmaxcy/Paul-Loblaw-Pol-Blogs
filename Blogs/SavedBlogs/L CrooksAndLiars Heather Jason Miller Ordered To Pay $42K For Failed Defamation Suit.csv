L, Jason Miller Ordered To Pay $42K For Failed Defamation Suit, Heather, 2021-05-23, A US district judge has ordered former Trump aide Jason Miller to pay Gizmodo nearly $42000 in legal expenses from his failed defamation suit. Miller sued Gizmodo over a story published by Splinterwhich alleged that he secretly administered an abortion pill to a with whom woman he was having an affair in a smoothie. As reported by the Daily Beast a federal appeals court rejected his second defamation suit against the parent company "finding that the now-defunct website Splinter had accurately reported a 2018 viral story titled “Court Docs Allege Ex-Trump Staffer Drugged Woman He Got Pregnant With ‘Abortion Pill’” which the Trump spokesperson claimed had cost him his contract as a  paid political commenter for CNN. Miller had argued in his second  attempt that those court documents were out of bounds but last month a  panel of judges on the 11th Circuit ruled that they were protected under  New York fair reporting privilege and upheld the 2019 decision."
