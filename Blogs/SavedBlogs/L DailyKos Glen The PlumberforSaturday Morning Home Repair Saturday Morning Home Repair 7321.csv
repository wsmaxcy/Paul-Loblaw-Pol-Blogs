L, Saturday Morning Home Repair 7/3/21, Glen The PlumberforSaturday Morning Home Repair, 2021-07-03,  Welcome again to Saturday Morning Home Repair blogging where we talk about fixing houses and the things in them that are supposed to work for us. An ad hoc cadre of building professionals and gifted amateurs attempt to answer questions that arise from readers and offer encouragement and advice for those inclined to do things for themselves if they can. We all do a lot of things collectively and can probably help out with insights from our vast experience. Or sometimes we just gab. Have an interesting story or project to share? Contact Glen The Plumber about posting it for Saturday Morning Home Repair.
