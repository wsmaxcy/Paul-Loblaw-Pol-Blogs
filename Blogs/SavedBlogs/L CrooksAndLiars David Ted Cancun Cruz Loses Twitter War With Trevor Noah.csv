L, Ted 'Cancun' Cruz Loses Twitter War With Trevor Noah, David, 04-29-21, Comedy Central host Trevor Noah on Wednesday fired back at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) after he attacked the comedian on Twitter. During his Tuesday Daily Show program Noah highlighted the fact that a newly release U.S. Census reports suggests that New York will lose a House seat while Texas will gain two seats. "This is really unfortunate for New York state because it means that one of its congressional districts disappears" Noah explained. Cruz responded by mocking Noah on Twitter. "Trevor Noah whines that people are fleeing high-tax blue states & moving in droves to low-tax states like Texas where the jobs are" Cruz wrote. "Doesn't understand why people like freedom."
