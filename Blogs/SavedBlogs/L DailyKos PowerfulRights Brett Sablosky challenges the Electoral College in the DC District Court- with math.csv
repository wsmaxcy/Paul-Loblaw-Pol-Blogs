L, Brett Sablosky challenges the Electoral College in the DC District Court- with math, PowerfulRights, 2021-04-20, Plaintiff is a United States citizen a registered voter in the state of Illinois a resident of Cook County Illinois. Plaintiff claims that his vote should be counted with equal value to every other popular vote of every citizen in every state and the District of Columbia. Plaintiff claims that under the United States Constitution and the 13th Amendment 15th Amendment the 19TH Amendment and the 1st Amendment thereof  each popular vote of every voter in all 50 states and the District of Columbia must be valued at 1 unit vote per person.  Plaintiff claims that the national popular vote plurality winner that is the candidate who wins the highest total number of popular votes is the only legal constitutional winner of the presidential election. Plaintiff claims that the value of his vote cast for Hillary Rodham Clinton and the value of all votes cast for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the November 8 2016 presidential election have been illegally devalued by the Electoral College system in violation of the 13th Amendment 15th Amendmentmendment U.S.C.A. the 19th Amendment U.S.C.A. and the 1st Amendment of the U.S. ConstitutionU.S.C.A.   Plaintiff claims that Hillary Rodham Clinton is the legal winner of the 2016 Presidential election. P laintiff claims that Donald John Trump and Mike Pence are the legal losers of the 2016 Presidential election.  Plaintiff asks this U.S. District Court to make findings of law consistent with plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff asks this court for declaratory relief herein asked for in this complaint and plaintiff asks for injunctive permanent relief and orders as well to implement plaintiff’s claims at law should plaintiff be the prevailing party in this lawsuit and should the court agree with claims made by plaintiff and adopt and order implemented the remedies plaintiff asks for. Plaintiff did apply for a preliminary injunction to be issued by this court to maintain the status quo which was denied by this court. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief consistent with plaintiff’s claims in this complaint. Plaintiff realistically expects that this case will be heard on appeal by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and ultimately that the United States Supreme Court will accept the case on certiorari and  rule on the issues of this case on the merits.   Plaintiff claims that Plaintiff’s vote is unconstitutionally reduced in mathematical value to .78 or 78% of the average value of votes of qualified voters who reside in fourteen Southern states. Southern voters living in thirteen Southern states Arkansas Alabama Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Missouri Tennessee Kentucky West Virginia Florida and Texas have a vote which is worth on the average 1.27 times greater than an Illinois voter’s vote in terms of mathematical value.  An Illinois voter’s vote is worth 1.8 X 10 to minus 6 electoral votes.          An average Southern voters vote is worth 2.3 X 10 to minus 6 electoral votes.                 1.8 X 10 -6 electoral votes divided by 2.3 X 10-6 electoral votes equals .78 or 78%. So an Illinois voters vote is worth .78 or 78% of a Southern state voter’s vote.    To fully understand the mathematical comparisons that the plaintiff is making here the reader must understand that our mathematical notation in powers of 10 to the minus 6 is expressed in terms of electoral votes. What the plaintiff is doing here is converting popular votes into an electoral vote value for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia by dividing the number of electoral votes each state is assigned in a given election year and then dividing that number of electoral votes by the population census number for that state.  For example Ohio in 2000 U.S. Census was given 21 electoral votes. We divide the 21 electoral votes in Ohio for that year by the Ohio population in the 2000 U.S. Census which is 11353000 which gives us a value of each Ohio voter’s vote in terms of electoral votes. The numerical results give a solution of approximately 1.6 X 10 to the minus 6 power electoral votes which in decimals is .0000016. On the table 1 the plaintiff show the value of popular votes expressed in terms of electoral votes for all 50 states and the District of Columbia for the 1990 census the 2000 census and the 2010 census.   Since presidential elections occur every 4 years each population census figures are usually used for 2 elections based on the fact that House of Representative districts are redistricted every 10 years after a new census has been taken.       Note that the 2000 election was an election in which the winner of the popular vote plurality total in the entire United States Al Gore did not win the electoral vote majority of 270 electoral votes. Al Gore won the national popular vote plurality total by over 500000 popular votes. George W. Bush Jr. won the majority of electoral votes because the United States Supreme Court interfered with the Florida Supreme Court’s orders for County Boards of Elections to do recounts if they wished to do so. The actual real totals for Al Gore Jr. and George W. Bush Jr. were never found out. This was because the United States Supreme Court ordered an end to the recounts in Florida and picked George W. Bush as the winner of the presidential election.   Table #4 gives the value of popular votes in terms of electoral votes based on the 2010 census figures and the 2010 numbers of electoral votes given to each state. The 2010 census figures were used to calculate the number of electoral votes in 2012 and 2016 presidential election.  Table #5 shows the value of popular votes in terms of electoral votes that Hillary Clinton won and that Donald Trump won for each state in which each candidate won the popular vote plurality.  In the 2016 election Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote plurality total with a total of 65432202 popular votes. In the 2016 election Donald Trump lost the national popular vote plurality total when Trump won 62793872. Donald Trump came in second in the total number of popular votes received for president. In the 2016 presidential election Donald Trump won 303 electoral votes far more than the 270 electoral vote minimum constituting a majority of electoral votes needed to win the presidency. So Donald Trump came in second in the number of popular votes won but won the presidency by winning more than a majority of electoral votes. Trump won exactly 303 electoral votes. A minimum of 270 electoral votes constitutes the majority number of electoral votes required to win the presidency.  Plaintiff claims that a wide variation in mathematical values exists from the value of popular votes in Northern liberal/moderate states to Midwestern farming/ great plains states. Such wide variation in mathematical value of votes runs from. 1.8 X10-6 in New York Pennsylvania Massachusetts Illinois to 2.2 X 10-6 in Kansas 2.9 x 10-6 in Nebraska 6.0 X 10-6 in Wyoming 3.0 X 10-6 in Idaho and 3.3 X 10-6 in Montana. Easily we can see here that a conservative vote in farming/great plains states on the average is worth 1.27  times the value of a vote in the  liberal/moderate states block. That is a conservative vote in the following states Kansas Nebraska Wyoming Idaho Montana Colorado Utah North Dakota South Dakota is worth mathematically on the average 1.27 times more than the average value of a liberal/moderate vote in New York Pennsylvania Delaware Maryland Illinois Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Wisconsin New Jersey California Connecticut Hawaii Oregon Rhode Island Maine Vermont Washington and the District of Columbia.  In terms of our Constitution looking at the content and legislative intent of the 13th 15th and 19th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution something is very wrong with the Electoral College method of electing a president of the U.S.  Something is very wrong with this system that assigns a wide range of different mathematical values to popular votes of people who live in different states and have different ideologies. Prior to 1829 state legislatures decided for whom they wished to cast electoral votes for president. By 1836 every state gave the right to vote for electors in the electoral college to qualified voters who at that time were only white males. Examining the value of votes in states where the majority of voters have conservative ideology and seeing that the value of votes in conservative states equals 1.27 times the value of a liberal vote in liberal/moderate states a shrewd observer sees that the Electoral College system give a distinct mathematical advantage to the middle population Southern states and the low population farm/great plains states in terms of mathematical values of votes. Voters of conservative ideology have a substantial built in advantage of winning elections for the conservative republican candidates for whom they usually vote. Plaintiff voter claims that this major mathematical inequality that gives conservative voters in middle population and low population states such substantial mathematical advantage in choosing a president is a major violation of the guarantees of the 19th Amendment 15th Amendment and 13th Amendment and 1st Amendment  of the United States Constitution. A close examination of the 2016 Hillary Clinton v. Donald Trump and the 2000 George W. Bush v. Al Gore Jr. gives us the mathematical data to clearly see how when the Southern conservative states vote with the farm/great plains conservative states the increased mathematical values of popular votes converted to electoral votes which are cast for conservative presidential candidates who consistently are Republicans clearly destroy diminish and violate the 19th Amendment and the 15th Amendment voting rights of liberal/moderate black and liberal moderate white voters in the high population liberal/moderate Northern states and Western states. That is the Illinois New York Pennsylvania Delaware Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Wisconsin New Jersey California Connecticut New Mexico Hawaii Oregon Rhode Island Maine Vermont Washington Virginia and the District of Columbia which is the block of liberal/moderate states. There are swing states. Ohio Florida Colorado Iowa North Carolina    There are two basic voting blocks of states and a third group of swing states The Northern Liberal/Moderate block of states votes primarily for liberal democratic presidential candidates. This block consists of the following states: New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Illinois Wisconsin District of Columbia Michigan Rhode Island Connecticut Massachusetts Maine Vermont Delaware Maryland Minnesota Washington Oregon California New Mexico Virginia and Hawaii. The Conservative block of states usually vote for the Republican Conservative candidate for president. This block consists of two groups of states. The Southern block consisting of  West Virginia Indiana Tennessee Kentucky North Carolina South Carolina Georgia Arkansas Missouri Louisiana Alabama Mississippi Texas New Hampshire and Alaska. The Great Plains block of Conservative state consist of North Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Oklahoma Kansas Wyoming Colorado Utah Montana Idaho Nevada Arizona. The following states can go either way Democratic or Republican in presidential races:  Iowa Ohio Colorado North Carolina and Florida [2000 election was deliberately stolen in Florida by improper counting refusal to count ballots clearly marked in which the intent of the voter to vote for a particular candidate Al Gore Jr. was very clear Deliberate ballot destruction and fraudulent marking of ballots was committed by insider clerks working for the Republican Party and the Bush campaign. Duval County had 22000 ballots most of which were double punched and ruined deliberately by insider clerks at the Board of Elections in Jacksonville who were working for the Bush campaign and the Republican Party of Florida plaintiff alleges. In multiple counties of Florida there were approximately 15000 ballots marked for Gore and had Al Gore’s name written in on the write in space additionally. Because the name of Al Gore was written in on the write in space provided for a write in candidate to be written in by voters who wished to vote for any write candidate in addition to the space for Al Gore being punched or marked these ballots were never counted for Al Gore].  In clear violation of case law from the Florida Supreme Court these ballots marked 2 times for Al Gore Jr. once with the round circle marked with a pen for Al Gore Jr. and then these ballots had the name Al Gore written in in ink on the line that said write in name of candidate which was actually supposed to be only for write in candidates.  These ballots were set aside as over votes and these ballots were never counted for Al Gore Jr. These so called over votes were ignored. The intent of the voters who cast these ballots were never determined by visual inspection which is what Florida law commanded clerks at the Boards of Election to do and Al Gore wrongly was deprived of about 15000 votes and lost the election.     TABLE #4 COMPARATIVE VALUE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULAR VOTES IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL VOTES IN THE 50 STATES AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ELECTORAL VOTES ARE DIVIDED BY 2010 U.S. CENSUS POPULATION IN EACH STATE AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA These 2010 Census population vote values were used in the 2016 Hillary Clinton v.
