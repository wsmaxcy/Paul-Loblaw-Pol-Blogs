L, Caitlyn Jenner Pleads For People To Think Of The Private Plane Hangar Owners, David Moye, 2021-05-06, It remains to be seen whether voters want Caitlyn Jenner to be the next governor of California but the GOP candidate trying to unseat Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom just tried to deepen her appeal to the owners of private airplane hangars who hate seeing homeless people. During a Wednesday interview Fox News’ Sean Hannity the Olympic champion and reality TV star lamented California’s burgeoning population of homeless people.  But rather than sympathize with those on the edges of society or suggest how government could help Jenner bemoaned the effect on a fellow airplane owner who uses a hangar near hers. “My friends are leaving California. My hangar the guy right across he was packing up his hangar” Jenner told Hannity. “And I said where are you going? And he says ‘I’m moving to Sedona Arizona. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t walk down the streets and see the homeless.’” “I don’t want to leave” Jenner continued. “Either I stay and fight or I get out of here.” Caitlyn Jenner to Hannity: "My friends are leaving California. My hangar the guy right across he was packing up his hangar and I said where are you going? And he says 'I'm moving to Sedona Arizona I can't take it anymore. I can't walk down the streets and see the homeless'" pic.twitter.com/Z1WbBBQXq7 Jenner’s campaign pitch shows she “wants to fight people who are homeless” but she’s not “saying she wants to make the lives of all people in California better including those who are experiencing homelessness” RawStory pointed out. Not surprisingly the callous campaign comments inspired some Grade-A Twitter mockery. What a world. What a world. Imagine the dread of having to pack up your hangar for your private jet and move out of California to Sedona because you don't like to see the homeless . . .The horror.The horror. https://t.co/pG5kucZsLe “It’s so bad in California people are forced to pack up their hangars to avoid the poors”Not quite the sales pitch she thinks it is... https://t.co/WYt81IgOGc When you lost the private airplane hanger crowd... https://t.co/PkLPXZ7VwA Discussions with your airline hangar neighbors are very relatable to the average voter https://t.co/m4HOLV94Df Exactly Caitlyn. Private jet owners are the victims. Because they are subjected to the specter of homelessness through the tinted windows of their limousines. You’re a great humanitarian. https://t.co/9Jlzv9tmYA Clearly she's a natural politician with razor-keen instincts for how to relate to the common folk https://t.co/tq9sSWWBSz Dear @Caitlyn_Jenner: California grew by 2.4 million people the last 10 years. Also unlike you Dems are focused on the 99% of people who don’t own planes or hangars. And you know what’s going to help reduce homelessness? The #AmericanRescuePlan which your party opposed. https://t.co/xRRiiDMb0l Who amongst us *hasn’t* lamented with our neighbors over the inability to keep our private airplane hangers safe from the homeless these days? 🤦🏻‍♀️ #CancelCaitlyn https://t.co/8CtZWnufQO This lady is at least 13 different kinds of ridiculous https://t.co/aswijOMRum Reminder Trumps tax bailout which ballooned the deficit for the rich included deductions for private planes. https://t.co/XIsh1YwaPg The voters want someone you can share a Gulfstream with. https://t.co/QsYdLqf1dk Polling very high among the coveted “people with private hangars who think the poors are gross” demographic https://t.co/DETCXkF10a It's not like Fox would ever get behind a wealthy out-of-touch reality show television personality trying to become a politician. https://t.co/PUyi9m7ITD
