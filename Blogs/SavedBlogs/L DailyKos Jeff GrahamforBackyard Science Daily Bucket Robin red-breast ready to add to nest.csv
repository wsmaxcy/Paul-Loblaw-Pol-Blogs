L, Daily Bucket: Robin red-breast ready to add to nest, Jeff GrahamforBackyard Science, 2021-04-23, Robins are only one bird that is getting ready to nest this spring. The following photos are not only of birds making nests but are of bird and animals that I have seen this spring.  I have so many photos of some birds that I will save them for a separate Bucket. Hummingbirds feeding young Pied-billed grebe on a nest with 4 eggs and mating Cooper’s hawks incubating eggs in their nests Ospreys on nests (at least four nests in our area) Bald eagles on nests and nuthatches in nest cavities. Here are some birds and other animals in the past couple of weeks.                            My style is photos first and some text. I would love it if you added to this Bucker with either some of your photos or just text letting us know what’s happening in your part of the world.
