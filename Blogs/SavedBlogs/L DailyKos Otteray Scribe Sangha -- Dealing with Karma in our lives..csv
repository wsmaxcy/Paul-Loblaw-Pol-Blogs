L, Sangha -- Dealing with Karma in our lives., Otteray Scribe, 2021-05-09, Welcome to members of the Daily Kos Sangha* and all interested visitors who happen by. Each of us has our own path; we come here by way of many different traditions and of no particular tradition. While the language we use may differ depending on the traditions teachers practices and teachings that have shaped our journeys we find in common generally a search for who we truly are our true nature and to bring the peace and compassion born of that search into the greater world of which we area part. If you wish to share or if you seek support or if you simply want to say hello please do as this space is for you Whether one believes in karma or not fortune follows us. In order to shake the dross of our past life there are some basic practices which may help.  Alan Watts explains:  Concentrating on the Root Chakra while meditating along with this music can be helpful. Good speakers or headphones are recommended in order to properly reproduce the basic 396 Hz tones.  Nemaste Peace this day and every day.  Take this time to sit and quietly take in your surroundings in a comfortable place.  Do not dwell on thoughts that enter your mind for long as the need to empty the mind while sitting is what is to be realized all the while concentrating on your breath:  Breath in and exhale out and truly realize the moment of this time that is just for you it is your place your time you are at home. This is an open thread. Please add your thoughts meditations and reflections as you wish.  *Attribution: Creator of Dkos Sangha Weekly Thread Brother “davehouck”.
