L, CLASSIC POETRY On Shakespeare's Birth/Death Day: "When I consider everything that grows" (Sonnet 15), Clio2, 2021-04-23, Holds in perfection but a little moment; That this huge stage presenteth naught but shows Whereon the Stars in secret influence comment;                                  When I observe how men and plants increase                                 Cheered and checked each by the selfsame sky                                  Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease                                  And wear their brave state out of memory; Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight Where wasteful time debateth with decay To change your day of youth to sullied night;  .    Good frend for Jesus’ sake forbeareTo digg the dust encloased heareBlest be the man that spares thes stonesAnd curst be he that moves my bones  . . .  The lives of individuals pass; but love is ever-living.
