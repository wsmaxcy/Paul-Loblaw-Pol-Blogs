L, I really feel Mass protesting and public media outcry will ensure Manchin/Sinema bends., sreeizzle2012, 2021-07-03, Also even when I feel Gavin Newsom and Biden are wrong on certain things (other oil pipelines) they are responsive to public outry/criticism.  I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt they are responsive to protesting and correcting wrongs.  I have faith the people will win both in reconciliation AND breaking the filibuster.
