L, Citing a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity FAA slows Boeing 777X cert., DButch, 2021-06-27,  Boeing is back on  the front page of the Seattle Times — now it’s about problems with the Boeing 777X program.   In a sternly worded letter dated May 13 which was reviewed by The Seattle Times the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out probably in late 2023. This will delay the jet’s entry into service to early 2024 (four years later than planned). Among the problems: A lot of pretty interesting stuff and a definitely non-deferential attitude towards Boeing by the FAA that’s pretty overdue. From the FAA letter: The letter concludes by requesting that Galantowicz’s unit “close these gaps” before submitting any further requests for TIA approval and that “based on the information from Boeing” 777X certification is realistically more than two years out in “mid to late 2023.” Dominic Gates the Seattle Times main person on the Boeing beat does close with some good news: because of the pandemic’s destruction of international air travel demand — no airline in the world wants a 777X right now. ETA — “the” in the first link
