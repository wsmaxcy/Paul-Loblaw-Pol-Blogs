C, Super Bowl End Times Notes, Steven Hayward, 2021-02-07, Well that Super Bowl was a throwback to the lopsided boring games of the 1980s. But it might not be over. Even though the NFL stopped counting points when the clock ran out I am reliably informed that there will be 12 mail-in touchdowns for the Chiefs coming in tomorrow morning at 4 am putting the Chiefs over the top. Meanwhile other signs that the End Times are indeed upon us—quelle horreur:  French people eating at their desks! Dogs and cats living together can’t be far behind. It gets worse:  Happy Monday everybody. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
