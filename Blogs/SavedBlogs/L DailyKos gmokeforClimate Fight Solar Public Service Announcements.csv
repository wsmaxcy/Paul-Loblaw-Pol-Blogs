L, Solar Public Service Announcements, gmokeforClimate Fight, 2021-04-22, The first solar video I produced was for the Urban Solar Energy Association [USEA] back in the early 1980s. One of the 10 second public service announcements was “A south-facing window is already a solar collector. Learn how to use it.” with the contact information for USEA. Another was “A south-facing porch can become a solar greenhouse. Learn how to build one.” We got a few hundred dollars in a grant from a group that was refusing to pay war taxes to make 3 inch tape copies and I took them around to the TV stations. Even saw the spot once late at night I think on Channel Five. Unfortunately when I took these solar PSAs to the local TV stations they had no time available. Only one local UHF station (remember UHF?) Channel 56 took a copy but I’m not sure that it ever made air.Since then I’ve made some of my own short Youtube videos on simple solar principles as I have always believed that you can teach the basics of practical solar energy at least for emergency/survival electricity and heat in a half hour or less.Recently I compiled a playlist on Youtube of all my simple solar stuff at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_NN__fS5pM&list=PLkauPyDTdD2A9t4w-ZVMytJS8MpE2dB7NSome of the products mentioned are no longer available but I believe the basic solar information is still good.
