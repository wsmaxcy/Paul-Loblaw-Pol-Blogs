L, Owls, michelewln, 2021-05-09, Welcome to Street Prophets Sunday Coffee Hour an open thread conveniently located at the intersection of Religion and Politics. Owls fascinate me. Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance a large broad head binocular vision binaural hearing sharp talons and feathers adapted for silent flight.  Many owl species have asymmetrical ears. The eyes of an owl are not true “eyeballs.” Their tube-shaped eyes are completely immobile providing binocular vision which fully focuses on their prey and boosts depth perception. Owls can rotate their necks 270 degrees. A group of owls is called a parliament. This originates from C.S. Lewis’ description of a meeting of owls in The Chronicles of Narnia. I love doing the adult color books and look for the owl pictures to do first.
