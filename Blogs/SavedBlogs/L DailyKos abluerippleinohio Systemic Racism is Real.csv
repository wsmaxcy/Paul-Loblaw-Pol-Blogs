L, Systemic Racism is Real, abluerippleinohio, 2021-05-01,  No amount of backward bigotry will shake my faith in the goodness of America. I meant what I said on Wednesday night and I’m glad Joe Biden and Kamala Harris agreed with me: America is not a racist country. pic.twitter.com/exKyRfmnrl I will respectfully disagree with you Senator Tim Scott. Systemic racism is very real. Please keep in mind when you don’t address systemic racism you are the face voice and embodiment of white denial. "I want a bill that's passed that specifically speaks to racism and discrimination and white supremacy in policing. And I want that bill to trickle down to police policy and reform. We have a broken system" Joanne Sabir a Milwaukee voter says. https://t.co/QrUrWeo4jw   Black voters especially Black voters in the Midwest want these policies.  There are Black voters that need accountability from the police departments. Black parents that have lost a child to police brutality or have to care for a disabled loved one because of excessive force are bearing the cost having to hear about “compliance with the police department” each time we see a video of excessive force or police brutality. Each time you deny the existence of systemic racism Senator Tim Scott you assist in helping people like Governor Tate Reeves to say systemic racism isn't real. You are also helping Senate Minority Leader Addison Mitchell McConnell deny federal funding for the 1619 Project to be taught in our schools because "it's evil". In this Post and Courier article A Black disabled man would not have received $546000 in wages from his former employer for enslaving him. In fact his employer would have gotten away with his enslavement instead of doing 10 years in prison.  In this Complex article a White man is facing ethnic intimidation after a Black Door Dash driver drove around him to deliver food to someone in his apartment complex in Stow Ohio. The Door Dash driver had her 3 year old child in the car. Because of systemic racism being recognized it is possible for this lady to receive justice.  However this incident happened because he felt emboldened to do what he did and he felt he would be left off the hook. In fact I’m leaving this tweet here. It has all the denial you choose to stand. Democrats want to teach white kids that they're racist and minority kids that the deck is stacked against them. Wokeism and 1619 are causing more division. We must stand up to stop them now.
