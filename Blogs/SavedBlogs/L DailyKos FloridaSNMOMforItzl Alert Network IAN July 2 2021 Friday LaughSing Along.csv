L, IAN: July 2 2021 Friday Laugh/Sing Along, FloridaSNMOMforItzl Alert Network, 2021-07-01, Happy Friday! Today is grocery day. We’re going to be stocking up a bit on non-perishable things because Elsa may be affecting us later next week unless of course she changes course. But I’d rather be ready than not. We’ve already gotten ‘side swiped’ by two systems. Just enough to give us some rain a little bit of wind and really mess with my fibro and FND. As of this writing (Thursday) I feel a bit better hopefully that carries through into Friday because we have to go out.   As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos. If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we are going to check up on you. If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here. We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries. Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime! We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news!

This is the desktop “Laugh out Loud Jokes” calendar for 2021. What do cats put in their tea?Mice cubes. What kind of cat likes to swim? A Platy-puss. Why was the cat afraid to climb the tree? It was scared of the bark! Why did the farmer plant his phone in the garden? He wanted to grow a call-iflower. Why did the little boy have so many vegetables?He was a kinder-gardener!Here is a funny little song/video that my daughter likes and often gets stuck in my head:   And then of course there’s the Muppets..   The kids and I used to ‘sing’ this one while we were waiting for the bus. A lot of people probably thought we were nuts but it kept the kids occupied.  This one actually this whole album was another one the kids and I used to sing while waiting for the bus.
