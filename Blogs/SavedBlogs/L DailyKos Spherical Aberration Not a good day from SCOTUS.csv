L, Not a good day from SCOTUS, Spherical Aberration, 2021-07-01, Two rulings from the Supreme Court today both with 6-3 toplines (all 6 conservative Justices vs. all three liberal ones) although admittedly the majority in Americans for Prosperity is sort of a cobbled-together mess. The first of the two cases is a(nother) significant weakening of the VRA. I imagine this one’s going to get the most attention here so I’ll leave it to other writers to examine in detail. Executive level summary: It isn’t good. But the second case is probably going to cause bigger problems down the road. This is Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta. AFPF is part of a complication network of organizations established by the Koch brothers. Readers here are probably far more familiar with Americans for Prosperity (no “Foundation”) which is their 501(c)(4) nonprofit social welfare organization which is legally required to be non-partisan (although that’s easily gamed via its legal definitions) and with limits on the percent of its expenditures that are for political purposes. In practice the AFP is an important source of conservative dark money funding. Meanwhile the AFPF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity organization which is essentially prohibited from political activity. Of course the two share the same offices and have identical staff. So you do the math there. But this case isn’t about whether the Koch Empire cheats on their 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) requirements and obligations. Rather this is about a California law that mandated charities reveal their list of donors. Today the majority opinion from the Supreme Court declared this “facially invalid” under the 1st Amendment’s right to free association. Frankly having the California law struck down in some manner wasn’t surprising and the AFPF had an unusual set of bipartisan supporters in the case. Liberal-friendly (and far more legitimate) charity organizations have motivation to keep individual private low-dollar donors private just as the AFPF does have motivation to keep its big money sources secret albeit for different reasons. As a result the AFPF position actually had support from the ACLU NAACP and CAIR here. Okay fine. Law isn’t easy. But here’s the problem. It’s almost certainly not going to stop with 501(c)(3) donor lists. The majority ruling explicitly says that per other controlling law this ruling doesn’t apply in the context of campaign finance or election funding. But Roberts writing for the majority then went on to give us this (emphasis mine): While exacting scrutiny does not require that disclosure regimes be the least restrictive means of achieving their ends it does require that they be narrowly tailored to the government's asserted interest. Anyone who thinks this isn’t a preface to an attack on all funding disclosures isn’t paying very close attention.
