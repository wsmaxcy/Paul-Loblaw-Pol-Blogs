C, Good News Bad News, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-04, First the bad news—we may not have reached Peak Insanity yet but we’re getting closer every day: eBay removing all listings of six canceled Dr. Seuss books Online retailer eBay is removing several Dr. Seuss books from its website that are no longer being published. A spokeswoman for the website told the Washington Examiner on Thursday that it would no longer be allowing sellers to list six books that have been deemed by Dr. Seuss Enterprises the company that preserves Theodor Seuss “Ted” Geisel’s legacy as containing racially insensitive imagery. “At eBay we have a strict policy against hate and discrimination to ensure our platform remains a safe trusted and inclusive environment for our global community of buyers and sellers” eBay Corporate Communications Specialist Parmita Choudhury said. “We’re currently sweeping our marketplace to remove these items. It can take some time to review all existing listings and provide education to impacted users. We’re also monitoring the newly published list to be reviewed.” All right how about some good news: The United States suspends tariffs on Scotch whisky and other British products. The tariff suspension is expected to help several types of British exporters especially the Scotch whisky industry. In October 2019 a 25 percent tariff was placed on Scotch whisky and exports to the United States have since dropped 35 percent costing companies more than £500 million (about $700 million) the industry’s trade group said. Cashmere and Stilton cheese producers will also benefit the government said. Finally here’s the Tweet of the day:  Boom! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
