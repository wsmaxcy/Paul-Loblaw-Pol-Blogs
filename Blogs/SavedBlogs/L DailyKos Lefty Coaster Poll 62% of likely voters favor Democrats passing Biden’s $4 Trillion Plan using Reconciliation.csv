L, Poll: 62% of likely voters favor Democrats passing Biden’s $4 Trillion Plan using Reconciliation, Lefty Coaster, 2021-06-29, We got this! BY MORGAN CHALFANT A majority of likely voters in a new poll supports Democrats passing President Biden’s $4 trillion agenda using the budget reconciliation process without needing Republican support according to new data from a progressive polling firm obtained by The Hill. The poll conducted by the progressive think tank and polling firm Data for Progress for the group Invest in America found that 62 percent of those surveyed somewhat or strongly support passing Biden’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan together using budget reconciliation. There are considerable differences across party lines with 86 percent of Democrats supporting the use of the reconciliation process 59 percent of Independents supporting it and only 36 percent of Republicans supporting it.  Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed said they would be somewhat or much more likely to support a lawmaker who votes to spend $400 billion on long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities “even if it’s passed on a partisan basis.” The poll also found that 55 percent of respondents would be less likely to support a lawmaker who blocks the passage of a bill including $400 billion for long-term care in order to pass a bipartisan infrastructure package. This Progressive poll sampled 1183 likely voters with a 3% MOE. Both Biden’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan are popular with voters at a time when the only thing Republicans can think of is going back to their more tax cuts for the wealthy well.  And their increasingly tiresome culture wars.
