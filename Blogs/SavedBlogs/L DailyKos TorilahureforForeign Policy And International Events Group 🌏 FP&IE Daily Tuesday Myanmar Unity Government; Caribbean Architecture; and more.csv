Myanmar: Starting off at Myanmar in the latest developements where the resistance to military junta has arrived at a resistance led National Unity Government (Delwar Hossain at Modern Diplomacy 11 may 2021  The National Unity Government in Myanmar: Role and Challenges) via  The Diplomat (10 May 2021) where Sebastian Strangio writes Myanmar Junta Labels Shadow Government ‘Terrorists’ The designation never bodes well for the possibility of peaceful resolution to a crisis. On Saturday Myanmar’s military junta officially labeled the country’s shadow National Unity Government (NUG) and its nearly announced armed wing as “terrorist organizations.” The NUG was established last month by the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw Representative Committee (CRPH) a group of elected legislators who were barred from taking their seats when the military seized power on February 1. Last week the National Unity Government announced the establishment of it’s a People’s Defense Force (PDF) a possible precursor to an ethnically inclusive nationwide federal army. On Saturday evening state television announced that the NUG and PDF as well as the CRPH had been added to the junta’s list of “terrorist organizations.” China - Hong Kong based SCMP (10 May 2021) Zhou Xin has some thoughts one what is driving the change in Chinese economic planning  Xi Jinping’s grand economic strategy was born out of China’s new perception of the world a A man’s behaviour is often shaped by his perceptions of the world around him. He may feel relaxed in a safe and comfortable environment but turn alert and defensive in a hostile one. A country’s chosen strategies and decisions to some extent are also a reflection of policymakers’ impression of the world. China’s inward-looking economic strategy known as dual circulation emerged as China’s reading of the world changed. According to the transcript of a speech by President Xi Jinping in January that was recently published the coronavirus’ disruption of cross-border trade flows directly contributed to Beijing’s new economic strategy. In Xi’s own words he found that “the global supply chain witnessed a partial breakdown” in early 2020 when he toured the coastal province of Zhejiang as the coronavirus was spreading throughout the world. As a result part of China’s domestic economy stopped functioning as “many local companies couldn’t source much-needed materials from abroad overseas personnel couldn’t get into China and cargos couldn’t be shipped out”.

It is a satire account although the replies might lead you to conclude some people think otherwise. Pakistan: Over at Modern Diplomacy (11 May 2021) Hemza Mehmood has some advice from Machiavelli to the Prime Minister in this article where he looks at how a particular group is affecting the nation.  Pakistani Fanatics and their Foreign Policy Overtures A prudent leader ought to have regard not only for present troubles but also for future ones. They must prepare with every energy because when foreseen it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach the medicine is no longer in time. Through not having been foreseen they have been permitted to grow in a way that everyone can see them there is no longer a remedy. These words are famously attributed to 16th-century Italian Philosopher Machiavelli advising the ruler about statecraft in his Magnus Opus The Prince. A similar kind of ignorance and obliviousness against which Machiavelli was warning to the ruler of the state was reflected by the government of Imran Khan when protests by a radical religious organization (TLP) shook the country from 11-20 April. Previous to this latest episode TLP has also staged various sit-in and violent protests by which they effectively froze all life in twin cities as well as in various cities of Punjab. Caribbean: At Global Voices In her own words Janine Mendes-Franco  (“I'm constantly trying to define [...] a Caribbean aesthetic'”) takes a look at Nichilas Huggins and his latest project  Imagining the Caribbean's architectural alphabet  (Tori Note:There are some amazing pictures there which I am unable to produce here due to having forgotten to ask permission in time. Instragram link for artist Instagram Nicholas Huggins   )  Trinidadian artist and graphic designer Nicholas Huggins recently completed an interesting experiment. There's an annual online project called 36 Days of Type which “invites designers illustrators and graphic artists to express their particular interpretation of the letters and numbers of the Latin alphabet” for 36 consecutive days. Having observed the submissions over the past few years Huggins decided to take up the challenge by doing something different—creating an architectural alphabet of the Caribbean. In an email interview Huggins admitted that because it was “a bit daunting to create something new every single day for 36 days” he wanted to set additional parameters to his interpretation of the letters: “That's how I came up with the idea of trying to make [them] in the shapes of local architectural forms.” The result is a series that captures the vernacular of Caribbean architecture as well as its vibrant spirit and history a process that began with observation. “I have a collection of photographs on my phone that I take when stopped at red lights or when I go on walks” Huggins says “and these form the basis of where I pull certain elements from. Sometimes I may be driving or I'll be without my phone so if I see something I make a mental note of what I've seen and I use different techniques to help me remember and once I'm at home I make a sketch of whatever it was.” Brazil: Over at Folha de S. Paulo something that had baffled why for some reason Biden had thanked Modi for lifting the export control during Trump era. Even at that actual time in April 2020 thanks poured in from Trump Bolsonaro and Netanyahu. I could understand why export control was lifted. It is not as if India could afford to upset anyone. Anyway  here is something that might add to the constant bewilderment on my part.  Telegrams Show that Former Foreign Minister Mobilized Itamaraty to Promote Chloroquine  Former foreign minister Ernesto Araújo mobilized Brazil's diplomatic apparatus to guarantee the supply of chloroquine in the country even after the World Health Organization interrupted clinical trials with the drug and after medical associations warned of the ineffectiveness and risk of side effects. This is what diplomatic telegrams obtained by Folha and information from people involved in the negotiations revealed. The former minister who resigned at the end of March will give a deposition at the Covid CPI next Thursday (13) to explain whether Brazil suffered in the purchase of supplies and vaccines because of the foreign policy of this administration. Itamaraty's race for chloroquine began shortly after President Jair Bolsonaro (no party) spoke of "a possible cure for the disease" on his social networks on March 21 last year. Uganda: I close off with this from Daily Monitor (11 May 2021) Uganda is preparing for the swearing in ceremony for the next term (6th) of president Musevini. Seven heads of state to attend Museveni swearing-in (Tori notes: the list is longer and contains plenty prime ministers and vice-presidents.) I assume enough pre-cautions to prevent this being a superspreader event. Highly-placed government sources Tuesday said at least seven heads of state will be attending President Museveni’s May 12 swearing-in ceremony.A list which was sent to Daily Monitor shows that heads of state who will not make it have sent their representatives. The Minister for the Presidency Ms Esther Mbayo last week told the media that the government had sent out invitations to at least 42 heads of state.President Museveni will be sworn in for his sixth elective term at Kololo Independence Grounds having been declared winner of the January 14 polls. The heads of state are Alpha Condé (Guinea) Emmerson Mnangagwa (Zimbabwe) Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed (Somalia) Salva Kiir (South Sudan) Evariste Ndayishimiye (Burundi) Nana Akufo-Addo (Ghana) and Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi (Democratic Republic of Congo) who is also the chairperson of the African Union.
