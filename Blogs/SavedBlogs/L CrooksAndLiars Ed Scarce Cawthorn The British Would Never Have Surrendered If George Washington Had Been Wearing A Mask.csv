L, Cawthorn: 'The British Would Never Have Surrendered If George Washington Had Been Wearing A Mask', Ed Scarce, 2021-05-23, The youngest and perhaps the dumbest member of Congress came out with this one yesterday on some rightwing program I can't be bothered to mention. And perhaps it's something he's said before some trite delusional slogan these halfwits like to impress other halfwits with namely that real men project an image of "strength" at all costs even if that means spreading deadly disease. I guess that's the "logic." Maurizio Valsania a scholar and professor of  American History Università di Torino who's written extensively on George Washington gives his opinion. The 18th century was an age of paradoxes for sure but also of high republican standards and even higher humanitarian goals. Males themselves embraced high ideals. A humble self-effacing forgiving cooperative magnanimous benevolent and “feminine” man would have been immediately deciphered as both successful and strong back then. Especially a public leader. Especially a president. Those who wear masks project strength. They show self-awareness self-control patience perseverance and many other Washingtonian virtues. Washington would have definitely worn his mask. He would have done so out of respect for his community out of respect for those who had suffered and died and out of respect for all the manly roles he played. Madison Cawthorn says that the British would not have surrendered at Yorktown if George Washington was wearing a mask. pic.twitter.com/CIVAdtpwaQ — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) May 21 2021 And of course... George Washington also made all American troops get a smallpox vaccine in the first state funded immunization campaign ... https://t.co/grLOgf4L0p — Eugene Daniels (@EugeneDaniels2) May 22 2021 In Feb. 1777 while at Morristown Washington became convinced only inoculation would prevent the destruction of his Army. Washington ordered the inoculation of all troops without haste. Therefore reason dictates he was pro science pro mask and pro vaccination. @DrEricDing pic.twitter.com/Sy0wXPawTn — Vincent J.
