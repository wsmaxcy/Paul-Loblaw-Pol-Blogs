L, Oh nothing. Just Donald Trump still bragging about passing a dementia test, Aldous J Pennyfarthing, 2021-06-30, Donald Trump was in Texas today June 30. Something-something about the border. Who knows why he was there really? Maybe he wanted to brag about the wall you can breach in a few minutes with a $100 reciprocating saw from Home Depot. Or maybe he wanted to remind Americans about his child-separation policy which simply everyone loved. Ah the good old days. But what stuck out was this: Person Woman Man Camera TV: It's 2021 and Trump is still bragging about that easy cognitive test. pic.twitter.com/o2EenwQmUy  TRUMP: “They did a test. Did I ace it? I aced it and I’d like to see Biden ace it. He won’t ace it. He’ll get the first two. There are 35 questions and the first two or three are pretty easy. They’re the animals. Is this a lion a giraffe? When he gets to around 20 he’s going to have a little hard time. I think he’s going to have a hard time with the first few actually.” Yup that’s Donald Trump still bragging about the dementia test he passed months after the fact. Honestly I’m more embarrassed for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott than for Trump. Trump does this shit all the time. It’s expected. But it must be horrifying to sit next to him and have to pretend he’s not the saddest salmagundi of insensate protoplasm and ear hair clippings in the known universe. Seriously who looks at a guy bragging about passing a dementia test—a test doctors give to people they suspect of having erm dementia—and thinks “Yup. That’s my hero. Let’s follow him into the breach. If he leads us astray well at least we know he passed a dementia test a year ago. Can’t say we didn’t do our due diligence.” It’s good to know our former pr*sident knows the difference between a lion and a giraffe. That’s heartening and it certainly was never a given. But even if he isn’t showing signs of dementia—a big if—I’d argue it’s still pretty horrifying that he thinks this is some sort of feather in his cap. After all if he thinks acing a dementia test is a big deal how fucking stupid is he really?  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter that is). What is it? The viral letter that launched four hilarious Trump-trolling books. Get them all including the finale Goodbye Asshat: 101 Farewell Letters to Donald Trump at this link. Just $12.96 for the pack of 4!
