L, Texas FAIL: Freeze Death Toll MUCH Higher Than Reported, Frances Langum, 2021-05-27, Brian Williams closed out his show "The 11th Hour" Thursday night with this item from Buzzfeed News:  "The true number of people killed by the disastrous winter storm and power outages that devastated Texas in February is likely four or five times with the state has acknowledged so far." While the State of Texas run by Republicans contends that 151 people died as a result of the freeze and its subsequent predictable power outage the real death toll is more like over seven hundred people.  "This astonishing toll exposes the full consequences of officials' neglect and preventing the power grid's collapse despite repeated warnings of its vulnerability to cold weather as well as the state's failure to reckon with the magnitude of the crisis that followed" says BuzzFeed News. Brian Williams didn't sugarcoat it:   Indeed the Texas legislature has decided on its priorities.  They've passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.  They've passed a measure restricting the teaching of critical race theory... ...and as we mentioned earlier they've passed this "no permit no problem" measure basically meaning any adult in the state who wants a handgun should be able to get one without training or registration.  They are in other words doubling down on the Red fearing that their state is turning purple politically. Then Brian Williams showed a picture of Ted Cruz flying to Cancun during the disaster: The article "The Graveyard Doesn't Lie" is well-worth the click. Most of the uncounted victims of the storm and power outages were already medically vulnerable with chronic conditions. But without the intense cold and stress they experienced during the crisis many of these people would likely still be alive today. pic.twitter.com/p4gtB1QPiF â€” BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) May 26 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
