L, IAN:Thursday 4/29/2021 Mostly Recipes, art ah zenforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-28, We have been boxed up for so long and now we all want to fly away.  I am staying put for a while longer but may go to Gold Beach Oregon in the late fall to see family.  Beyond that the rest of this diary is dedicated to recipes.  Enjoy. As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos. If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we are going to check up on you. If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here. We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries. Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime! We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news!

Potato Chip Cookies 1 lb salted butter 1 c granulated sugar 3 ½ c sifted flour 2 tsp vanilla 1 ½ - 2 c crushed plain potato chips Cream together butter and sugar.  Add remainder ingredients.  Drop by tablespoons full on cookie sheet and criss cross with fork.  Bake @ 350 for 15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Let cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes before moving to cooling racks. Makes 4 ½ dozen  Stinky Bread from the Sweet Potato Queens 1 cup butter smooshed 1-2 cloves garlic 1 tsp dried basil 2 tablespoons capers chopped tiny mix this stuff.  take loaf French bread cut crust off top and sides but not bottom.  cut slices 1 inch thick but not thru bottom. put loaf into foil “boat” bringing up sides but not covering top.  put mozzarella cheese between each slice.  slather loaf with butter mixture top and sides and bake under broiler til crispy and brown. now I only used half that much butter it was just way too much.  I also didn’t use capers didn’t have them.  use any herb that makes your sneakers squeak.  use any cheese you like.  it’s a very versatile idea.  And this is my sister in law’s recipe for fruit salsa and chips.  It is really good!  I have made it with a bag of mixed frozen fruit as well as a variety of fresh fruits.  The berries sugar and preserves meld everything together.  Fruit Salsa and Tortilla Chips Ingredients: 2 kiwis peeled and diced 2 Golden Delicious apples - peeled cored and diced 8 ounces raspberries 1 pound strawberries 2 tablespoons white sugar 1 tablespoon brown sugar 3 tablespoons fruit preserves any flavor  10 (10 inch) flour tortillas butter flavored cooking spray 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar Directions: 1. In a large bowl thoroughly mix kiwis Golden Delicious apples raspberries strawberries white sugar brown sugar and fruit preserves. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 3. Coat one side of each flour tortilla with butter flavored cooking spray. Cut into wedges and arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle wedges with desired amount of cinnamon sugar. Spray again with cooking spray. 4. Bake in the preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with any remaining tortilla wedges. Allow to cool approximately 15 minutes. Serve with chilled fruit mixture
