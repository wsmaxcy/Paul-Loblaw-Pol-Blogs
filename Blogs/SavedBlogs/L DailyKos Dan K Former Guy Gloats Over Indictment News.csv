L, Former Guy Gloats Over Indictment News, Dan K, 2021-07-01, The indictment hasn’t been unsealed yet though we do know for sure that Weisselberg will be charged; he surrendered this morning. And while it is still possible that Former Guy will be also be charged FG himself doesn’t think so — which of course is all that matters to him. Playbook is reporting his reaction when he got the news about the indictment on Monday: He would not be personally indicted Trump was told — only Weisselberg and the Trump Organization would be. Trump was thrilled by what he saw as light charges and according to one of the advisers on the call his mind raced to 2024. “Just wait until 2024 you’ll see” Trump said. The former president implied that the legal case would be seen as a political witch hunt that would backfire on Democrats. “This is going to hurt Sleepy Joe.” Not a word about his uber-loyal CFO facing years of prison. Not even a thought for the organization he’d built up (and down!) all these years. Even though this is purely a state action FG immediately thought it would hurt the president. And it would also help him in 2024. He wants to run again. The adviser had the impression that Trump who was already coming off a high from the large crowd at his rally in Ohio last weekend was emboldened by the news. “Now he’s definitely going to run for president” again the person said. It’s going to be a loooooong four years.
