L, Trump Cult Whiteboard Goes Viral Documents The Insanity, Frances Langum, 2021-07-07, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Someone spent a lot of time putting all of this "information" on an erasable whiteboard.   Right-wing podcaster Clay Clark explains (in a video from April) this truly phenomenal conspiracist-laden whiteboard entitled "the Path to Trump."  A large Trump head in the center and arrows! arrows! arrows! show everyone from Lin Wood to Sydney Powell and all the wannabes "connected" to Donald Trump.  Jesus is Lord of course and there's apparently a smaller picture of Jesus directly above Trump's head.  Yes this is Glenn Beck on steroids but it's also a brag book for Clay Clark.  There are red asterisks next to the "Trump connected" people denoting those he has had on his podcast.  Clark even says the purpose of this is to get "the message" to Trump via his "connections."   The unidentified man in the video says "The thing is is that I think Clay almost every single one of these people that is on this board almost every single one we've had on the podcast we called them we've talked to them because we're trying to get the message to Trump."  And obviously the "message" is "Come on my podcast Donald Trump!" As the popular tweeter Patriot Takes shared an image of the whiteboard Tuesday night it went viral.  And the answer is: What does a cult look like? https://t.co/vF1ZaAATf5 — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) July 7 2021 might be the single best image of the state of the party in 2021 https://t.co/HDJcxyoi5d — Allahpundit (@allahpundit) July 7 2021 first thing I thought of https://t.co/tvAD8OA25K pic.twitter.com/ZUWe5nRksm — Spencer Rothbell (@srothbell) July 7 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
