L, Supreme Court won't hear dispute over bathrooms for transgender students, eeff, 2021-06-28, Supreme Court won't hear dispute over bathrooms for transgender students The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up the issue of whether the nation's schools must allow students to use the bathroom that match their gender identities. The court declined without comment to hear the case of Gavin Grimm who has been at the center of a long legal battle with the school board in Gloucester County Virginia. Grimm was born female but identified as male after his freshman year in high school legally changing his name and beginning hormone therapy. The principal at first gave him permission to use the boys' bathroom but the school board later adopted a policy saying restrooms were "limited to the corresponding biological genders." Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said the Supreme Court should have taken the case. This case started in 2015 the 4th circuit ruled in his favor. So this has been a long battle. Grimm is happy the legal fight is over. CNN Supreme Court gives victory to transgender student who sued to use bathroom
