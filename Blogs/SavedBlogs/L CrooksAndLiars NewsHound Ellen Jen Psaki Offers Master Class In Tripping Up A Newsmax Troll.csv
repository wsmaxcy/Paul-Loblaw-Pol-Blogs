L, Jen Psaki Offers Master Class In Tripping Up A Newsmax Troll, NewsHound Ellen, 2021-05-08, The Newsmax troll playing a reporter on TV Friday was Emerald Robinson. She tried – and repeatedly failed – to ensnare Psaki into a defensive posture over the right-wing fantasy that Biden is too feeble to be in charge of his own administration. Unfortunately for Robinson she never seemed to think of a Plan B in case Psaki didn’t provide the deer-in-the headlights moment Robinson hoped for. PSAKI:  Who were saying that?  Who’s saying that? ROBINSON: You’ve heard that a lot in the media. MS. PSAKI:  Who in the media? ROBINSON:   Different people. MS. PSAKI:  Like? Obviously Robinson couldn’t think of a single person other than maybe bigger right-wing trolls she models herself after so she tried to deflect with a different topic but with the same messaging. Not surprisingly she got the same result: MS. PSAKI:  Well it’s hard to react when I don’t know what people you’re talking about.  I will say that the president met with the prime minister as you know and had a full meeting a full press conference afterwards and they even shared a meal. So — and the president has had dozens of conversations and calls with world leaders and should be no surprise that the vice president is also playing an important role engaging with and having discussions with foreign leaders. At that point the floundering Robinson claimed Harris is doing more than other vice presidents have (wink wink). That didn’t work out either. “How so?” Psaki asked with a straight face. “I’d love to see the data if you want to give me — “ Robinson promised to “provide you with that sometime” meaning she had no idea whether the talking point she had just spouted was true.  You can mark on your calendar as “never” for the day that data gets presented to Psaki. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
