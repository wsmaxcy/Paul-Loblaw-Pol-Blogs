C, The Week in Pictures: Gee-Whiz 7 Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-19, The G7 summit is over but it certainly seemed more like the Gee Whiz summit. Of course the most important news of the week was Victoria’s Secret giving up its least secretive secret by deciding as someone put in on Twitter to switch from models with eating disorders to models with mental disorders. Which is par for the course these days. Oh and happy Juneteenth—the day Republicans freed the slaves from their Democrat masters.                                                Headlines of the week—and might as well start off with one of the classics from the archives:                           In honor of Pride Month.                             And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
