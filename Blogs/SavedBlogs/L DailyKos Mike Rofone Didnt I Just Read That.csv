L, Didn't I Just Read That?, Mike Rofone, 2021-06-29, This is my rant about the comments I see on KOS. Let me say  I’m not against comments at all I spend (I’m sure as do many) more time in reading and making comments than I do on most of the diaries themselves. While these comments can provide Insights additional information and some great humor and witty snarks I don’t see the value in some types of comments I frequently see. For instance I don’t understand why some people’s comments are just a requote of a paragraph or a line from the article they are commenting on. They do it without any further addition of their own and I fail to see what value those kinds of “comments” add.  Personally I don’t see value in rereading something in bits and pieces that I have just read in full. Add something new to the conversation if you’re making a comment don’t just repeat what someone else said word for word. While it’s great to gain insights from others’ opinions or additions to the information given or useful links to articles related to the subject many times I see the discussion go way too far down the rabbit hole of comments about subjects far from the original. One commenter goes off subject and  a whole string of comments start about a completely different topic. Stay on subject comment about the topic. If you want to say something on a different subject then start your own diary to talk about that. I’m trying to follow my own example here as I originally was going to make this a lengthy comment in the comment section about an article on a completely different subject. And on a similar note  If you have so much to say  that your comment gets longer than what you are commenting on perhaps it’s time to write your own journal instead. OK I expect backlash for this one. but I’ve had enough grammar lessons and I don’t need them in the  comments. Personal dislike cuz I are as gud in englesh as I care to bee. While it may be important to point out a word used in an incorrect context or meaning don’t feel compelled to give a citation of all of Webster’s alternate definitions. And why correct the way someone spells it. If they wanted to put in the effort to get it right they would pay attention to the spell checker before  they publish it. I know what they intended.  A personal grievance  for me is with those who don’t know the difference between the meaning of effect and affect But I don’t point it out every time I see it happen. If your main interest is in grammar consider starting your own diary about  that and those with a similar interest will seek it out. The spelling and punctuation police strike me as showing off  their education instead of trying to add to the conversation. And lastly snark is snark and there’s way too many times I see others take offense by reading their own personal slant into what is (in mast cases obviously) an attempt at humor or sarcasm. And I see people do this about snark that  even has a (/s) snark tag on it. Yes there’s a lot of edgy humor in some of the comments but it is meant as HUMOR and I would bet most of us find that entertaining. I would find the comments much less enjoyable without them. And yet it gets serious responses from people who I would guess most of the time get the joke. But they see it as an invitation to get on their own soapbox. I don’t usually attach a snark tag to my snarks because I feel if I need to then I’m not doing it right. People make jokes and snide remarks because they’re trying to inject a little humor into a conversation not everything is meant to be taken seriously. LIGHTEN UP ALREADY!    I expect some of what I just said will be commentroversial so if you agree or disagree with me let me have it!
