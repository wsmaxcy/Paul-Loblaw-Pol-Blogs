L, VA-Gov: Trump's GOP Candidate Got Rich By Killing Jobs & Driving People Out Of Their Homes, poopdogcomedy, 2021-07-01, Can’t say that I’m surprised: Newly retired Judy Pavlick was among hundreds of seniors who enjoyed the low cost-of-living and friendly atmosphere at Plaza Del Rey a sprawling mobile home park in Sunnyvale California. Then the Carlyle Group acquired the property and things began to change. Pavlick’s rent surged by more than 7%. Additional increases followed. She said the unexpected jump forced her and her neighbors many on fixed incomes and unable to relocate to sometimes choose between food and medicine. The 2015 acquisition and subsequent sale of Pavlick’s mobile home park is a core business practice for private equity firms such as Carlyle which buy and restructure private companies to build value for their investors sometimes cutting jobs and services in the process. But the deal one of hundreds Carlyle executed in recent years could become a political liability for the company’s former co-CEO Glenn Youngkin who is now running as the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia and highlighting his experience “building businesses and creating jobs.” “They don’t realize that these are peoples’ homes. We’re not just numbers on a spreadsheet” said Pavlick now 74 years old. “They have no conscience.” There are no allegations of illegality or wrongdoing but Youngkin’s political aspirations have drawn new scrutiny to his dealings at the Washington-based investment firm where he generated a net worth estimated at over $300 million before retiring as co-CEO last summer. Folks here’s a friendly reminder about why we have to keep Virginia Blue: While @vademocrats are celebrating a HUGE victory for voting rights in the Commonwealth the conservative-led Supreme Court is gutting the Voting Rights Act. This is what's at stake folks. Protecting the right to vote is going to come down to states and who we elect as Governor.  Voting rights are at stake in this election. Let’s get ready to keep Virginia Blue. Click below to donate and get involved with McAuliffe and his fellow Virginia Democrats campaigns: Virginia Democratic Party Governor Terry McAuliffe Lt.
