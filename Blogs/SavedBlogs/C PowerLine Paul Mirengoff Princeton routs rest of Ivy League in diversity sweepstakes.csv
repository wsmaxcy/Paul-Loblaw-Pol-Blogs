C, Princeton routs rest of Ivy League in diversity sweepstakes, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-04-11,  Tech Gate USA has compiled a partial breakdown by race of the students offered admission by six of the eight Ivy League schools (all Ivies except Yale and Columbia). The breakdown is only partial because with the exception of Harvard the data released by the schools differentiate only between Whites and “persons of color” — an interesting fact in itself. The Tech Gate numbers purport to encompass all accepted applicants including international students although that doesn’t seem to be the case for Princeton at least. Here they are: 
Princeton  68% students of color 32% white Harvard 60% students of color 40% white  Cornell  59% students of color 41% white  Penn 56% students of color 44% white  Brown  55% students of color 45% white  Dartmouth 48% students of color 52% white
 So depending on one’s point of view Dartmouth is either winning or losing the race to the bottom. A few notes on these numbers. First I don’t know the racial composition of the applicant pool for these colleges. Approximately half of high school students in American these days are White but White representation among Ivy League applicants may be larger than that. Second in most cases we don’t know what the racial/ethic breakdown is among accepted applicants “of color” at these colleges. If hypothetically every accepted applicant of color is Asian then a high percentage of persons “of color” in the ranks of the admitted probably makes for an exceptionally well-qualified class. Data from the Harvard and Yale litigation show that Asians have somewhat better credentials — grades and test scores — than Whites.  But we know that Blacks and Latinos make up a considerable percentage of persons of color admitted by Ivy League schools. In the case of Harvard which provided these numbers 18 percent of admittees are Black and 13 percent are Latino.  We also know from the  Yale litigation that the credentials of admitted Blacks and Latinos lag far behind those of Whites and Asians. Thus the numbers reported by Tech Gate almost certainly reflect the dispensing to a huge degree of racial preferences to Blacks and Latinos.  Third although I found the Tech Gate article a bit confusing on this point it appears that “person of color” representation among those admitted to Ivy League schools or at least to Harvard and Princeton increased this year. This probably means that the amount of racial discrimination also increased.  One would expect this to be the case given the boost the BLM movement received following the death of George Floyd last May. Harvard’s victory at the district court and appellate levels in a discrimination suit (albeit by rejected Asian applicants) coupled with the Biden administration’s voluntary dismissal of a similar suit against Yale might also have contributed to the decrease in admission of Whites. Ivy League schools may regard themselves increasingly as bullet proof I suspect that some if not all Ivies are competing to see which one can admit the smallest percentage of Whites. That’s the off-the-record view provided by a college admissions counselor. If so Harvard will be disappointed to have finished second to Princeton in the competition. But if Harvard survives Supreme Court review in the case referred to above (or avoids review altogether) I expect it to move aggressively to overtake the school’s New Jersey rivals in the race to the top — or as I see it to the bottom.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
