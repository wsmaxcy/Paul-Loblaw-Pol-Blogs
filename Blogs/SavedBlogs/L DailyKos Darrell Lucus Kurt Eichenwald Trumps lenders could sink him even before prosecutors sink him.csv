L, Kurt Eichenwald: Trump's lenders could sink him even before prosecutors sink him, Darrell Lucus, 2021-07-01, Most observers looked at Thursday’s indictment of the Trump Organization and concluded that Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James have Donald Trump by the balls. But journalist and NYT bestselling-author Kurt Eichenwald peered into the guts of the indictment and discovered something else. Apparently even if Vance and James don’t bring Trump down his lenders could. As we all know Trump’s real estate empire survives almost entirely on borrowed money—according to Forbes he’s at least $1 billion in debt. Moreover according to Politico certain large loans include clauses that give a lender the right to call the loan if the borrower is indicted. While experts told Politico that it’s a near-certainty at least some of his loans include such a stipulation David Einrich of The New York Times reported that the loans with Trump’s favorite bank include no such stipulation. For those wondering what effect the Trump Org criminal charges will have on its @DeutscheBank debt the answer is basically nothing.Charges don't trigger repayment under the loan terms. Conviction of bank fraud might have an impact but doesnt sound like that's in the cards. But when Eichenwald looked at the indictment he discovered that even in the cases where Trump’s loan docs don’t trigger repayment it may not be enough to save Trump. In a long Twitter thread Eichenwald explained what most of us already know—the Trump Organization’s very existence depends on loans and Trump’s attempted self-coup made him so toxic that he can’t rely on Moscow or Riyadh to bail him out anymore. ...would fix any cash flow problems. He now has huge amounts of debt against assets that are plummeting in value because of January 6 and his toxic brand name. He *needed* the presidency to survive financially. I have always believed that is why he is so desperate to keep it...7  ....because if he was president he could hit up the Russians Saudis etc to bail him out. Now with him toxic and a threat to the country those nations know that any secret payments they make to him run a huge risk of being discovered.Which brings us to today's charges...8 That led him to take a close look at count 12 of today’s indictment which charges the Trump Organization with falsifying business records. ...all bank loans with a business come with "lending covenants." These are basically a series of requirements some of which include "you'll behave" in minor character. But *the most important part* of any loan covenant is the "books and records" portion. It is included in.../9  ...it's all or nothing like pregnancy: You either are or you arent. The books and records either are truthful or they aren't. Which brings us to count 12 which I think you can now understand the significance of: pic.twitter.com/xSJkwvimmR  ...they turn over every relevant book and record pertaining to these issues. If they refuse...BOOM. Loans pulled. If they do and the banks don't like what they see...BOOM. Loans pulled. If the loans come due (which 100s of millions do next year) no way they get refinanced..../13  ......and given that those of us who covered his business for decades - back when he was a democrat/reform party/whoever would have him - and always knew he was a crook all I can say is what the hell took so long? In other words—the minute the indictment dropped it’s a near certainty that the phones at Trump Tower were ringing off the hook with lenders demanding a full accounting. If Trump doesn’t turn over the records or he does so and they don’t add up THE LENDERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO CALL THE LOANS IN. And if enough of them do so the Trump Organization goes bye-bye. Earlier Thursday Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and tax law expert David Cay Johnston told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace that if Vance and James were so inclined they could use New York’s version of RICO to force Trump into receivership. But if Eichenwald is right—and given his experience covering corporate malfeasance he probably is—Trump’s real estate empire could be toast even before the prosecutors do their worst.
