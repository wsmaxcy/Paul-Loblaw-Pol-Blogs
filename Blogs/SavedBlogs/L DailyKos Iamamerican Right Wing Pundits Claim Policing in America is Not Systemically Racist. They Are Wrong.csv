L, Right Wing Pundits Claim Policing in America is Not Systemically Racist. They Are Wrong, Iamamerican, 2021-04-19, I came across an article this week published by Dan O'Donnell Daunte Wright for the MacIver Institute dated April 14 2021 and titled “The Truth About Police Shootings in America.” In the article the authors state emphatically that “The evidence is clear: Policing in America is not systemically racist.” In an attempt to bolster their position they use data from the Washington Post which actually does just the opposite: “The Washington Post has created a database of every known deadly police shooting in America since 2015.  As of this writing 6211 people have been shot and killed by law enforcement officers.  46% of them—2883 to be exact—were white while 24% (1496 total) were black.”   Let’s break that down shall we?  According to the US Census Bureau white Americans account for just over 76% of the total population in this country; and according to the WaPo piece they make up 46% of those killed by cops. Using my handy calculator I see that white folks are killed by cops at a rate equal to sixty percent or just over half of their population percentage.   Black Americans on the other hand according to the Census Bureau make up just 13% of the total population and the WaPo report says 24% of those killed by cops.   Check my math but that looks like Black Americans are killed by cops at a rate of almost twice their total population percentage. According to right wing media however there’s nothing to see here folks. USA Today in an effort to justify the racial imbalance in police shootings says that the Black Americans are to blame. They’re downright dangerous and need to be kept in line the thinking goes. Here’s how they put it: “Much of modern policing is driven by crime data and community demands for help. The African American community tends to be policed more heavily because that is where people are disproportionately hurt by violent street crime...”     Oh so that’s it? Just like missionaries cops are simply going where the need is the greatest! It’s not only the cops who are biased however. Racial bias extends to every part of our nation so much so that it literally defines who we are as a country. In a study titled “Race and Punishment: Racial Perceptions of Crime and Support for Punitive Policies” published in 2014 (that’s 7 years ago for those keeping score) Nazgol Ghandnoosh Ph.D. writes “Coming on the heels of the tragic events in Ferguson Missouri this report demonstrates that the consequences of white Americans’ strong association of crime with blacks and Latinos extend far beyond policing.”   In his study Dr. Ghandnoosh raises several issues to drive home his point: •Whites misjudge how much crime is committed by African Americans and Latinos. •Whites who more strongly associate crime with racial minorities are more supportive of punitive policies. •Media crime coverage fuels racial perceptions of crime. •Policymakers’ actions and statements amplify the public’s racial associations of crime. •Criminal justice practitioners also operate with and reinforce racial perceptions of crime. •Racial perceptions of crime have distorted the criminal justice system. •Racial perceptions of crime have undermined public safety.  Back to the “go where the crime is” mentality that’s used to justify more strict policing in neighborhoods or color: Let me tell you about a large non-profit organization in I worked for a few years ago in Palm Beach Florida. The board is comprised of the wealthiest part-time residents and every month during the “season” they meet. The job of the CEO’s assistant is to make sure there is a good selection of high-end booze for the members to enjoy before and after the meeting. And he has to make sure the booze is out and available before the 11 a.m. start of each gathering. I do not recall a single meeting where half of the members didn’t leave sloshed. If the cops really wanted to clamp down on drunk driving the valet exit would be akin to fishing in a stock tank.   Then there are the annual galas all over town where the champagne flows all night (along with other top -shelf booze) and hardly a soul leaves sober. Again if the cops really want to make a statement about impaired driving they could have had a field day. In Palm Beach County the Sherriff is an elected official and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out who funds the political campaigns so why in the world would he hold the rich folks accountable for anything? The point I’m making is that cops can find crime anywhere but they choose to find it in communities of color.  But no there’s no systemic racism. It’s just those Black crimers doing all that criming.
