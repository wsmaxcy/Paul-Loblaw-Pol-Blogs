L, Minerva @ Midnight: tragedy versus cynicism because Tucker Carlson calls mask-wearing child abuse, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-04-26, Peak cynicism has arrived. Tucker Carlson pimps a version of the nanny-state with more police confrontations because he thinks cops should stop children from wearing masks by enforcing child abuse laws. Apparently making a child wear a mask is like punching them in the face or the equivalent of exhibitionism. Someone is going to meet a tragic end because of these cynical calls for performative outrage and possible violence.   Tucker Carlson is now telling his audience to harass people who wear face masks outside.If they see children wearing masks Tucker says the response should be no different than when you see a kid being abused -- "call the police immediately contact child protective services" pic.twitter.com/4svVH0JY3s On the Monday night's Tucker Carlson Tonight the host referenced statements made by Dr. Mary Harrow. Harrow a general practitioner told the Colorado Springs School District 11 Board of Education last week that face masks can "cause low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels shortness of breath toxicity inflammation increased stress hormones and sugar in the body and create fear anxiety headaches compromised cognitive performance and other problems."  Commenting on this Carlson said: "Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid at Walmart. Call the police. Immediately contact Child Protective Services. Keep calling until someone arrives. What you're looking at is abuse it's child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it." www.newsweek.com/... Tucker Carlson urges viewers to oppose masks as child abuse: "Call the police" https://t.co/MEAVskNL6u  This is really really dangerous. Listen to his tone of voice and what he’s instructing. He’s moving from his viewers passively consuming his propaganda to having them act on it — against their neighbors. He’s testing his audience’s compliance. https://t.co/ZxqFMsboAW  A person who intentionally communicates to a law enforcement agency or the Department of Child Services a knowingly false report of child abuse or neglect commits a class A misdemeanorhttps://t.co/qimQiv6syn    These are strange times when Thomas Sowell a Black conservative and former marxist can be called a cynic however understandable. No doubt Sowell’s cynical vision was honestly come by. But it is not a tragic vision. It is bitter rather than sad and focuses on human folly rather than grace. According to Sowell any effort to change things for the better will perversely make things worse because we simply cannot know enough to bring about improvement—he does not even acknowledge that unintended consequences can sometimes be beneficial rather than corrosive. Progressive efforts to improve the lot of the poor have either amounted to nothing according to Sowell or have come at too high a price for the rest of society. By putting progressives in power we jeopardize the fragile accomplishments we’ve managed to bring about so far—better to roll the dice on a postmodern billionaire whose disdain for democratic institutions that took centuries to build was well documented even before he became president. So I say let us have the tragic vision of Tolstoy Harper Lee and King over the cynicism of Sowell. areomagazine.com/… Here is the piece for those interested https://t.co/xGR77Md3Q4  It was a cynical play For Israel to attack them while the US Secretary of Defense was visiting Israel.  Iran's Zarif says Israel made 'very bad gamble' by sabotaging Natanz site https://t.co/9zOjMZnLji pic.twitter.com/cot0QOxnc0 Iran said on Tuesday it will start enriching uranium to 60% purity a move bringing the fissile material closer to levels suitable for a bomb after accusing Israel of sabotaging a key nuclear installation. The disclosure came soon before the resumption of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers an accord Israel fiercely opposed after former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned it three years ago. A fissile purity of 90% is suitable for a nuclear bomb. Announcing 60% enrichment chief nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi also said Iran would activate 1000 advanced centrifuge machines at Natanz a nuclear plant hit by an explosion on Sunday that Tehran called an act of sabotage by its arch-foe Israel. However an Iranian official told Reuters later that "60% enrichment will be in small quantity" only. "From tonight practical preparations for 60% enrichment will begin in Natanz; 60% uranium is used to make a variety of radiopharmaceuticals" the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iranian nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying. The International Atomic Energy Agency the U.N. nuclear watchdog said it had been informed of Iran's decision. In Washington White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Iran's announcement "provocative" and said the Biden administration was concerned adding that it called into question Tehran's seriousness on nuclear talks. www.reuters.com/...

Capitalists are the only surplus-appropriating class in history to tolerate electoral democracy based on a broad franchise that embraces a significant proportion of the exploited class. Because of their peculiar position in relations of surplus extraction capitalists can tolerate both an alternation of governing teams and the presence of non-capitalists in the state. However their tolerance of electoral democracy is strictly limited and conditional. There are no historical cases of capitalists tolerating the outcome of elections that might threaten capitalist property relations. What’s more as the world economy becomes increasingly stagnant and as rates of investment in plant and equipment decline across the board a zero-sum struggle is beginning to emerge both among capitalists and between capitalists and producers. Whatever else might be implied by a resurgent democratic socialism and a capitalism in crisis they do not augur well for the future of competitive elitism. Whether they might lead to the establishment of a socialist democracy beyond capitalism is an entirely different matter. jacobinmag.com/... Capitalists are sometimes accommodating of electoral democracy. But at no point in history have capitalists ever accepted the outcome of elections that might threaten capitalist property relations. https://t.co/ITwlLojDAX
