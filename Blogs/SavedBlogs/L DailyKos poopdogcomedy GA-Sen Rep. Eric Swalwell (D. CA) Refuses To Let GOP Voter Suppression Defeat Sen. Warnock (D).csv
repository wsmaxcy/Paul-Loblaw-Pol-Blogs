L, GA-Sen: Rep. Eric Swalwell (D. CA) Refuses To Let GOP Voter Suppression Defeat Sen. Warnock (D), poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-28, Received this e-mail today from former presidential candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell (D. CA-15) in support of U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock’s (D. GA) re-election campaign:  It’s clearer now more than ever that Democrats need strong majorities in both the House and the Senate so that we can continue to pass meaningful legislation that makes a difference in Americans’ lives. That means it’s critical that we keep every seat that Democrats currently hold and pick some up along the way.  I’m teaming up with my good friend and colleague Senator Raphael Warnock to ensure he has the funds necessary to keep his seat come 2022.  We are just days away from the FEC’s End-of-Quarter deadline and both of our campaigns are closing in on our fundraising goals — so we need your help. Rev. Warnock’s seat is on the GOP’s target list for 2022 and in order to show the strength Democrats are ready to bring to the table this cycle we need all hands on deck. Can you split a $10 or $20 donation between Team Swalwell and Rev. Warnock’s campaign to help us both crush our EOQ fundraising goals?  This past January we asked Team Swalwell to fight like hell to turn Georgia blue. And thanks to grassroots supporters like you we were able to help turn out Democrats and undecided voters for both Senators Ossoff and Warnock. Replicating the results that turned Georgia out for Joe Biden in November wasn’t going to be easy in that unpredictable runoff election — but we fought hard and we got it done. Senator Warnock and I are both up for reelection in 2022 making this deadline even more important. Strong showings for our End-of-Quarter FEC filings will send a message to the GOP that we have the grassroots support necessary to hold our seats and grow our majorities in the House and Senate. Chip in $10 $20 or whatever you can afford to help Sen. Warnock and me reach our End-of-Quarter fundraising goals and give the GOP a hard fight ahead of the midterms.  I appreciate your support always Eric Swalwell Click here to donate to Warnock’s re-election campaign.
