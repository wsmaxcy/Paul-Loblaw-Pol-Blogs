L, Rep. Tim Ryan launches long-awaited campaign for Ohio Senate seat, Jeff SingerforDaily Kos Elections, 2021-04-26, It’s really happened: Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan has launched a campaign for Ohio’s open U.S. Senate seat. Ryan who is close to labor and had $1 million in the bank at the end of March is the first major candidate to announce a bid for Team Blue and he’ll likely be the frontrunner in a primary. He’d face a tough general election battle though in a former swing state that supported Donald Trump by a wide 53-45 margin last year.  Still the congressman and his allies are hoping that Ryan who has represented the Youngstown area in Congress since 2003 will be able to win back the type of working class voters who backed the Democratic ticket until the Trump era. He very much seemed to be aiming his opening message at this demographic declaring “Ohioans are working harder than ever they’re doing everything right and they’re still falling behind.” Ryan himself has also managed to decisively hold the 13th Congressional District which backed Barack Obama 63-35 in 2012 but only supported Joe Biden 51-48 despite its ugly trend to the right. Still his 52-45 showing last cycle was by far the narrowest victory in his 10 House campaigns. Ryan has until now explored running for statewide office numerous times only to stay in the House but his congressional district may not exist for much longer. Ryan made his announcement hours before the Census confirmed that Ohio would be losing a seat. Ohio Republicans also will more or less have free rein to draw the new congressional maps as they please despite the passage in 2018 of a supposedly reform-minded constitutional amendment and they very well could leave Ryan’s would-be Democratic successors without a friendly constituency to campaign for.
