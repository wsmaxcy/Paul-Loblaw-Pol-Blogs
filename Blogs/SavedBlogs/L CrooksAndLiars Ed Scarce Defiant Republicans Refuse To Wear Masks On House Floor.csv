Lauren Boebert Marjorie Taylor Greene Louie Gohmert Thomas Massie Chip Roy Bob Good Mary Miller Brian Mast Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Beth Van Duyne flouted the rules by Nancy Pelosi. Three of them were fined $500 for their first offense others received warnings. They also took selfies on the House Floor also a no-no. Source: Politico Around a dozen Republicans refused to wear masks during the evening vote series and strategically stood at the well of the chamber which appears on the C-SPAN cameras and seemed to encourage other members to join in. Lawmakers face hefty fines if they don't wear masks on the House floor: $500 for the first offense and $2500 for the second offense. The money is deducted from their salaries. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) snapped a selfie with a few other maskless members and posted it to social media. Taking pictures on the House floor is against longstanding rules due to security concerns. #FreeYourFace Masks are oppressive and nothing but a political tool.End the oppression! pic.twitter.com/EBvCtBpE6u â€” Marjorie Taylor Greene ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@mtgreenee) May 18 2021 These patriots stood up to @SpeakerPelosi and said no longer will we go against the science and perpetuate a culture of fear.
