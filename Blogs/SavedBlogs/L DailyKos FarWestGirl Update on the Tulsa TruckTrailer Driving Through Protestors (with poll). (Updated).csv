L, Update on the Tulsa Truck/Trailer Driving Through Protestors (with poll). (Updated), FarWestGirl, 2021-04-22, I just saw the video in Lefty Coaster’s diary about the new Oklahoma law that indemnifies drivers in riot situations and I need to qualify and defend this particular driver’s actions. This is a four horse trailer with a living area you can see in this other footage that protestors are throwing things at the trailer bouncing things (exploding water bottles?) off of it as he comes forward. All that noise and crap is scaring the hell out of the horses inside. They were probably spooked and kicking because they were scared of what was going on and had no way to do anything about it. But the big thing- that you only see as it goes past- is that someone has unlatched the loading ramp on the trailer and was trying to access the horses! You can see the ramp dragging on the ground. He’s not trying to hit anyone he’s just felt the horses shifting around and ramp drop and is getting his horses the hell out of danger before some idiot gets them loose on the road. He pulls over and stops in front of the cops and when the camera swings back you can see one of the cops is re-latching the ramp. Then the driver moves on out of danger.  I can tell you if it’d been me you’re goddamned right I would have done the exact same thing to protect those horses! New and more complete coverage with video shows a combination of people being stupid and scared and very aggressive. It turns out that two young children were in the vehicle but no horses were so pick who it’s better or more acceptable to terrify. It also shows the people hanging off the back of the trailer and unhooking the ramp. h/t to marleycat for the link to the updated news coverage.
