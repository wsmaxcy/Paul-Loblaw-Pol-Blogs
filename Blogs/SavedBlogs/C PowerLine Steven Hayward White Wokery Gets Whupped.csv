C, White Wokery Gets Whupped, Steven Hayward, 2021-05-03, This is the most sublime 70 seconds of video you’re likely to see today:  And Democrats wonder why Trump increased his share of the minority vote last fall. (Aside: while the initial speculation was that Trump’s increased share of the Hispanic vote came from “macho” Hispanic men the data show he actually increased his vote share more among Hispanic women.) Meanwhile an update on our previous story about Braden Ellis the Cypress College student who stood up for the police in class only to be berated by an idiot college professor. Young Mr. Ellis appeared on Fox News (below). Ellis has decided not to identify the professor (nor is it clear just how this clip made its way to YouTube in the first place) though it is reported separately that the professor apparently an adjunct is now “on leave.” I believe I have identified the professor but will await further reporting.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
