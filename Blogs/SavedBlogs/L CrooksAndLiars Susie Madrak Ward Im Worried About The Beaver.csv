L, 'Ward I'm Worried About The Beaver', Susie Madrak, 04-22-21, Despite Tucker Carlson's well-honed "golly gee I'm just asking questions" Theodore Cleaver persona there's a little bit of cray-cray seeping out around the edges lately. The maniacal laugh is new -- and Tucker's stress seems to date back to Matt Gaetz's last appearance on his show. You know the one where he talked about double-dating with Tucker? Is Tucker now a witness in the Gaetz investigation? Look federal investigations are expensive and becoming a witness however peripheral is costly. So maybe Tucker's worried about money? Unlikely. The self-appointed protector of the working-class has a net worth of $30 million and he makes $6 million a year at Fox. If nothing else I'm sure his wealthy parents could float him a loan. Is he medicated in some way? He does seems to have a Trump Jr. edge lately but without the red eyes. Who knows?

What human makes a sound like that?!” https://t.co/qXlfJjVvRo — The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) April 22 2021 Maybe it's the Chauvin verdict and he's having a tantrum over not getting the riots and burning cities he was hoping for. He wants a race war so bad he can taste it. Don’t ever forget that last night @TuckerCarlson accused those 12 Americans on that jury of not being smart enough decent enough or American enough to follow their oaths & arrive at a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. The evidence.What an elite twit Tucker is. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) April 21 2021 But something does seem to be going on. And it couldn't happen to a nicer white nationalist!
