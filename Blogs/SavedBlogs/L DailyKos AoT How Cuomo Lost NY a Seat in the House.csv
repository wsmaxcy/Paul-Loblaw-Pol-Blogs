L, How Cuomo Lost NY a Seat in the House, AoT, 2021-04-27,  In all honesty it’s getting rather hard to believe some of the things Cuomo has been responsible for. He helped maintain Republican control of the State Senate. He delayed shutting down at the beginning of the pandemic out of spite because the mayor had called for a shut down. He intentionally reported false numbers of nursing home deaths. He used state resources to write a book he made millions on. And of course there’s also the sexual harassment which he’s admitted to and the sexual assault. I’d assumed that this level of incompetency and corruption would get anyone kicked out of the party and hopefully of office but somehow there are people here who still love the corrupt bastard. Well here’s his latest escapade:  This a thread of Census receipts. The state failed us.In April of 2019 the budget allocated $20 million for Census outreach. It wasn't nearly enough but we knew how important this Census would be and made a down payment to get New Yorkers counted. 1/13 https://t.co/Q9vRT9cBCe  I recommend reading the whole thread. It’s a story of Cuomo’s contempt for NYC. a contempt that has now cost New York State a seat in the House of representatives.  If just 89 more people had been counted in New York and no other states counted more residents it would have held on to all 27 of its current seats in congress according to Kristin Koslap senior technical expert for 2020 Census Apportionment.  Yep that’s right we were 89 people short of keeping on of New York’s seats in the house and Cuomo’s refusal to disburse funds allocated to make up for the shenanigans we knew would come from the federal government is largely responsible for that shortfall.  We have a Democratic Governor who is aiding the Trump agenda and there’s still people supporting him. I just can’t understand this.
