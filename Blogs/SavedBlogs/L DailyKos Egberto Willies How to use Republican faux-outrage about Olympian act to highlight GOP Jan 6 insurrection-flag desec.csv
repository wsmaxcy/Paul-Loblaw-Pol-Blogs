L, How to use Republican faux-outrage about Olympian act to highlight GOP Jan 6 insurrection-flag desec, Egberto Willies, 2021-06-29, Republican leaders' faux-outrage over Olympian Gwen Berry's protest at the trials must be used to point out that they are the unpatriotic immoral ones. See full episodes here. Republicans are trying to get the upper hand as their continued policy and moral blunders accumulate. They are trying to use the Gwen Berry story to rehabilitate their un-patriotism. But that does not hold water. Berry is trying to make a better America with her protest. They are trying to create an oppressive America for most. A hammer thrower who will represent the U.S. next month at the Olympics and who turned her back to the American flag during the playing of the national anthem this weekend says she feels "set up" by U.S. Track & Field. Gwen Berry turned away from the flag Saturday while the anthem played as she received her third-place medal during the Olympic trials in Oregon. She later draped a T-shirt that read "activist athlete" over her head.

Democrats and Progressives must use Republican faux-outrage about the Olympian's act to highlight GOP Jan 6 insurrection & flag desecration and much more. We must lean into the fight. Morality empathy humanity and patriotism are on our side.
