L, Why are public health agencies BLOCKING health-protective measures for Covid-19?, Yogi Dan, 2021-07-06, Whenever there’s even a slight chance that human lives could be at risk the universal convention is to go to great lengths to safeguard those lives. There are countless familiar examples like safety belt and helmet laws safety factors for the strength of buildings and bridges and child-proof lids for medications. It’s well-known that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common and the groups who are known to be most deficient are among the groups most at risk for Covid–19. There’s also strong and steadily growing evidence that improved vitamin D levels cause improved Covid–19 outcomes. This evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency represents a major health risk during this pandemic but fortunately the efforts and resources involved to reduce it would be very small. Why have our health agencies gone against all conventional norms of safety by pretending that reducing this major risk to public health isn’t worth the tiny expense thereby blocking any campaign to eradicate this deficiency? Isn’t reducing health risks and thereby safeguarding human lives always worth doing especially in a pandemic? A strong majority of scientists have long been in favor of playing it safe with vitamin D including experts like Dr. Fauci. Why have our health agencies also gone against this majority opinion while effectively endorsing a “pro-risk” policy causing needless deaths? In the realm of scientific investigation it’s rarely convincing if a single team of scientists comes up with a result. It’s more convincing if a second team confirms the same result. The greater the number of independent confirmations the greater the certainty that something real is being measured. It’s also more convincing if the methods and results are peer-reviewed. A group of dedicated scientists has been regularly updating a meta-analysis of the published studies on the link between vitamin D and Covid–19. As of June 25th their 67th version includes 87 published studies based on the efforts of over 780 scientists & authors and recorded outcomes from over 57000 patients. Out of the 87 studies 80 of them (92.0%) found evidence of this link including 54 out of 59 sufficiency studies (91.5%) confirming that vitamin D deficiency leads to more severe Covid–19 outcomes frequently including death. Another 26 out of 28 treatment studies (92.9%) again confirmed the link further finding that improved vitamin D levels cause improved Covid–19 outcomes including reduced severity and fewer deaths. So far all but 3 of these 26 positive findings have been peer reviewed. Random errors can easily account for the few studies with negative findings but no error can adequately explain 80 out of 87 consistently positive findings. This scientific verdict is approaching near certainty indicating that vitamin D deficiency is a major risk and adequately correcting that deficiency is an effective protective measure against Covid-19. If it weren’t for the vitamin D deniers and their government-sanctioned authority this verdict would likely have been accepted many months ago. These studies substantiate the pre-pandemic findings that vitamin D is crucial to activating our immune defenses making anyone in vitamin D deficiency more susceptible to a wide range of illnesses including Covid-19 colds and flus the 1918 “Spanish flu” bone diseases tuberculosis cancers and more. These studies explain why those who are known to be more deficient in vitamin D (Blacks Latinos the obese etc.) have suffered higher death rates in this pandemic.  These findings imply that if we had followed many experts’ advice to eradicate this deficiency early in this pandemic that would very likely have saved hundreds of thousands of lives in America alone. These findings imply that a campaign to eradicate the wide-spread vitamin D deficiencies could still save many hundreds of thousands because only around 12% of the world population have been fully vaccinated and many countries and republican states will probably never reach herd immunity.  These findings imply that such a campaign would almost certainly reduce the number of vaccine breakthrough cases ending in severe symptoms or death making fully vaccinated people safer also. On the other hand these studies do not imply that we should slow down on our other efforts to protect people. As the authors of the meta-analysis put it: “While many treatments have some level of efficacy they do not replace vaccines and other measures to avoid infection. Only 7% of vitamin D treatment studies show zero events in the treatment arm.” A strong majority of scientists have long agreed that there’s more than enough evidence to warrant correcting people’s vitamin D levels to be on the safe side. This was clearly noted in Linda Benskin’s preliminary review of articles published over a year ago. A year later now that over 780 scientists have personally witnessed the effects of vitamin D in their own experiments the number of scientists agreeing with this opinion has surely increased. Dr. JoAnn Manson is the lead investigator on the largest and longest study ever undertaken on vitamin D. Last July she published A Call to Action stating: “…eliminating vitamin D deficiency will improve public health during the current pandemic and after the threat subsides.” Dr. Anthony Fauci made a similar recommendation last September:  "If you’re deficient in vitamin D that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection. I would not mind recommending and I do it myself taking vitamin D supplements.” With so many experts agreeing that eradicating vitamin D deficiency is a good idea and that it could save lives why hasn’t it happened? What’s so controversial about safeguarding human lives during a pandemic especially with something so obviously safe as getting people out of a vitamin deficiency with something our own bodies make from sunshine? Who could possibly be against a measure that would so clearly be beneficial to public health? Those in charge of our health agencies were hired by our governments to protect our lives not endanger them. And yet they’re the only voices I’m aware of who are insisting that there’s “not enough evidence” to justify taking action on vitamin D. But how much evidence is enough? The closest they’ve come to an answer was in a June 2020 “evidence review summary” (reviewed here and here) in which they claimed there wasn’t enough evidence because there were no intervention studies such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Once the first RCT came out they quickly issued a new statement to move the goal posts claiming there still wasn’t enough evidence. Now there are 25 peer-reviewed intervention studies including 5 RCT’s but there’s no sign they’re ever going to do anything more than continue moving their goal posts as many times as needed. This is not how scientists argue their views. These actions have more in common with Mitch McConnell’s conveniently fluctuating political standards than anything relating to the actual scientific merits of the evidence. I believe they’re only considering the evidence long enough to occasionally update their excuses in order to to continue blocking any action on vitamin D keeping people at risk for more severe Covid–19 outcomes and death. Since every national and international health agency is denying the evidence on vitamin D it appears that every key decision-making role within them has been staffed by health officials holding this minority “pro-risk” viewpoint. Given the large number of health-agencies around the world and their intended mission to reduce rather than maintain health risks it seems highly unlikely that people with such contrarian views would have ended up in control of all these agencies merely by chance. Economics suggests that Big Pharma may be somehow involved in backing these vitamin D deniers just as Big Oil has been repeatedly caught backing the climate change deniers. If Big Pharma is in fact behind this it would fit well with a repeating pattern of profit-motivated science denial that we’ve seen over and over. The dangers of smoking were “successfully” suppressed by the tobacco industry for over 40 years primarily through “sophisticated public relations … to undermine and distort the emerging science”. A more recent tactic in Big Oil’s “successful” campaign to delay climate action was placing insider spokesmen within the government or buying influence with them to promote their malevolent agenda behind a facade of apparent government legitimacy and authority. Ted Cruz and other corrupt politicians eagerly embraced their disinformation effort along with the campaign donations that came with it. In the case of vitamin D I believe that Big Pharma is following in the footsteps of the tobacco and oil industries by engaging in “sophisticated public relations … to undermine and distort the emerging science”. I believe that one of their public relations tricks was getting our health agencies to promote and enforce their “pro-risk” agenda for them which is to keep as many of us as possible in vitamin D deficiency as long as possible to help protect their profits. I don’t think this would be difficult for them because our health agencies are led by politicians and politics is driven by money and Big Pharma is by far the biggest financial force in health-related politics. To the best of my knowledge no other industry has the financial motivation to deny vitamin D combined with the influence and willingly malicious greed to do it. That influence and greed were both clearly demonstrated when they created a profitable but deadly opioid crisis and also clearly evident in Katie Porter’s recent questioning of AbbVie’s CEO. Getting back to all those officials in all those health agencies: regardless of their reasons blocking the reduction of health risks is effectively causing needless deaths and the only motive I can think of is to protect Big Pharma’s profits. This kind of corrupt behavior usually involves some form(s) of quid pro quo and who would pay for that if not Big Pharma? I could be missing something but I don’t see any other explanation that makes sense.  Regardless of who’s really behind this “pro-risk” agenda it’s an insane policy for any government to be following in a pandemic. These officials have been deceiving us: the vitamin D science never needed to reach 100% certainty in order for it to be worth minimizing this major health risk because it’s always worth minimizing health risks especially in a pandemic. The only substance these officials’ arguments ever had is the authority our governments gave them based on the authority that we the people gave our governments. Our health officials have betrayed us abusing their authority by keeping us at risk rather than protecting us. Regardless of why all our health officials are behaving this way we’re not paying their salaries so that they can play Russian roulette with our lives. All officials involved in this should be fired and prosecuted for their respective roles in ruthlessly keeping the immune systems of billions in a compromised less-effective state during a pandemic tragically causing countless deaths. Unfortunately until we start actively campaigning to correct the widespread vitamin D deficiencies we’ll effectively be ensuring that they’ll continue. The modern lifestyles that most of us have adopted are almost always indoors out of the sun meaning a lot of us just aren’t getting enough vitamin D. Minorities living by modern lifestyles in northern climates have paid an especially high price in this regard. We should have a public campaign to educate people on the importance of getting out of vitamin D deficiency starting with all the groups who are most at risk for it. We should go beyond the current standards of deficiency which were only intended for maintaining bone health and target higher levels that will better  ensure a healthy immune response. There’s every indication that we can still save a lot of lives with this. Saving lives by any means possible is the right thing to do and the more people we can protect the less time and opportunity Covid–19 will have to mutate into even deadlier forms than we’re facing now.  Let’s listen to the science and bring an end to this “pro-risk” insanity.
