L, Biden’s ‘skinny budget’ Proposes Support for Senior Housing, arthorfong, 2021-04-23, Seniors facing housing challenges in the United States may soon be in for a bit of welcome relief which should sound like good news to any well-meaning citizen. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) the population of seniors is expected to grow pretty quickly in upcoming years. It is pretty normal for seniors when they get to a certain age to want to stay in their homes for as long as they physically can. However challenges that hinder this possibility can also be quite normal especially when you consider accessibility and amenities for the elderly that are not really a concern for those who are fit and healthy. Typically the challenges relate to affordability accessibility and the elderly need for close proximity to health care services. In order to address these needs the HUD notes that what is needed is an increase in housing alternatives that cater to the aged and elderly. Some members of the aging population may also need access to rental aid in order to be able to afford properties once they become available. They will also need some type of support in maintaining their property. Of course one of the most obvious solutions that will be needed is a firm and accessible connection between housing and healthcare and this will actually help seniors to age peacefully and more comfortably in neighborhoods designed to meet their needs. These noted solutions may soon receive support from the Biden administration. On Friday some details of the President’s discretionary funding request to Congress were revealed. In regard to senior housing it includes provisions to address the affordability challenge seniors might face. Over $500 million in additional funding is to be provided to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program which is a form of federal assistance offered to states by HUD in order to provide decent and affordable housing especially housing for low and extremely low-income Americans. The program has not received such a high level of assistance since 2009.  Specific assistance has also been provided for the elderly and persons with disabilities in the form of a $180 million dollar support grant. It is supposed to help promote independent living for the elderly and also for persons who have disabilities. Another program the Social Security Administration (SSA) has also received additional funding amounting to a 9.7% increase. The increase is attributed to more efforts to help seniors since in addition to the elderly the program is already dedicated to assisting retirees survivors disabled people and elderly Americans with reduced income and wealth. This particular program will help vulnerable populations because it will improve the timely handling of disability applications extend outreach to disadvantaged communities and also make some effort to modernize information systems to an extent where seniors and persons with disabilities can actually use it properly. The additional funding towards these programs is expected to have a largely positive impact on the elderly population since it will increase their access and overall opportunities in providing housing for themselves. The administration has clearly demonstrated that this demographic of the population is an actual priority and will aid them in very demonstrable ways.
