C, Asking For ID Violates the Constitution?, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-02, America’s institutions have gone mad with organizations like Delta and Major League Baseball lining up to oppose sensible election integrity measures in particular identification requirements that can help prevent voter fraud. Of course if you pick up tickets at a major league will-call window you will have to present identification. And no one can board a Delta flight without a driver’s license passport or other ID. But no one has ever accused liberals of being consistent. The Babylon Bee is as InstaPundit puts it America’s Paper of Record. The Bee takes seriously liberals’ claim that requiring identification is a civil rights violation: “Gun Shop Asks For ID In Clear Case Of 2nd Amendment Suppression.” MACON GA—In a clear case of targeted 2nd Amendment suppression the clerk behind the counter at Yippee Kay Yay Firearms has asked a gun purchaser to show his identification. “You don’t need to see my identification” said store patron Willard VonCarlton who was trying to purchase a shotgun and a revolver. “I’m an American! It’s my God-given right to own a firearm!” The clerk was unmoved. “Yeah I get all that I just need to verify you are the same guy written on this paperwork” he said. “RACISM!” said VonCarlton. “You assumed I have an ID just from looking at me? Stereotype much? How are you even sure I know how to get an ID?” “I’ll tell you what this is– SUPPRESSION!” he continued. “You don’t want me to be able to defend myself! My 2nd Amendment will not be infringed! This is a HATE CRIME!” That argument is at least as good as the ones Delta MLB and others have made against the Georgia election integrity law. But gun buyers unlike lefties are generally sane. Thus: According to witnesses the clerk sighed and said: “Please just show me your driver’s license sir.” “OK fine.” But leftists have never said “OK fine” to anything. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
