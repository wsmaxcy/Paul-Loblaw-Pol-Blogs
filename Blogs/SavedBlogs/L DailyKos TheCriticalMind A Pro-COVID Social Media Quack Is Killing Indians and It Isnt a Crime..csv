L, A Pro-COVID Social Media Quack Is Killing Indians and It Isn't a Crime., TheCriticalMind, 2021-05-05, It seems it isn’t a crime to give people absurd and discredited guidance that can lead to sickness and death. Which allows charlatans such as Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury to make money off ignorance paranoia and wishful thinking. Chowdhury is an Indian with a large and devoted social media following in the sub-continent. Despite any formal training in medicine or nutrition he is the prime guidance for millions of trusting souls deeply suspicious of the scientific method. Opportunistic cynics like Chowdhury — and a whole horde of like-minded Americans — use religion’s strategy of fear to keep the superstitiously weak-minded eagerly throwing cash into the collection plate. They call COVID a hoax and then insist it’s "just like normal flu". They warn of Big Government using tracking-chipped vaccines to steal liberty. While they assert that Big Pharma pads its profits with useless nostrums. Or worse as Chowdhury claims     "Most deaths are not because of coronavirus itself but because of its treatment" And just in case you missed the point he tells the BBC "Drugs do not help in curing any illness. I strongly believe that humans do not need vaccines at all." And this despite the evidence of the efficacy of vaccines in the near eradication of polio smallpox diphtheria tetanus rubella and measles. And who dies of rabies anymore? It is mind-boggling how one of the great medical successes of human history has become a lightning rod for ignorance superstition and sheer stupidity. This raises the question of what medical expertise Chowdhury brings to the conversation? In short none. His sole academic credential is an honorary degree in ‘diabetes science’ from Zambia’s unaccredited Alliance International University - which is actually based in the Caribbean. Chowdhury’s money-grubbing vaccine-denial is not his first foray into fraudulent medical practice for profit. His claim that he can cure diabetes — both types 1 & 2 — in 72 hours was judged by the Advertising Standards Council of India to be “false and grossly misleading”. Indian health authorities have filed a criminal complaint against him for falsely claiming to be a medical practitioner offering fraudulent treatments and failing to provide emergency care at courses he has run. And it’s not just diabetes. In his videos he claims his diet plans rich in fruits and vegetables will cure COVID and AIDs as well. At his events he tells the audience: "I've got a box with me it is called the medical orange box... All the medicines we will put here and put a lock [on it].” He says he will give the medicines back if asked — but any psychologist will tell you that peer pressure will make that request unlikely.  It is one thing to claim some useless supplement has magical powers. It is quite another to demand that people walk away from proven treatments and substitute fantastical tommyrot. Is Chowdry a sadist does he have a messiah complex is he deluded - or is he just a cheap sociopathic hustler? India is a country steeped in the tradition of Ayurvedic medicine which uses food and herbal treatments to alleviate ailments. So Chowdhury speaks to an audience primed for his nonsense. But the US shows that even countries that embrace the Western pharmacological medical tradition have large populations eager to believe the most ludicrous nonsense. And as further proof that the human mind has universal faults Chowdhury has co-opted the Urdu word ‘azaadi’ meaning "freedom" - a rallying cry that resonates with many oppressed communities in India - for his slogan "masks se azaadi" ("freedom from masks"). Sound familiar? When science is proven wrong it is no longer science. When a fact is abnegated it is no longer a fact. But in the precincts of science-denial lack of proof is considered evidence that the truth is being covered up. The more facts produced illuminating the idiocy of the belief the more the believer digs in.  It is why religion despite millenia of wrong claims and unfulfilled predictions is as aggressive a cancer on the human psyche as it ever was. And why the apocryphal snake-oil salesman is not a historical symbol of psychopathic avarice but a clear and present danger.
