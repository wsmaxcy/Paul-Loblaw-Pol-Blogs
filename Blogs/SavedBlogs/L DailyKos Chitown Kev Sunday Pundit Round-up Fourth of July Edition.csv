L, Sunday Pundit Round-up: Fourth of July Edition, Chitown Kev, 2021-07-04, Good morning everyone! Some descendants of Mr. Frederick Douglass would like to say a word. Or two. Lindsay M. Chervinsky of CNN says that the United States should offer “full and complete statehood or independence”...and full citizenship...to the residents of the territories of Puerto Rico Guam the American Samoan Islands and the Virgin Islands. July 4th is always a moment to consider what it means to be an American -- and who counts as a citizen -- but this year also offers a unique opportunity to consider the holiday's legacy and how we might live up to its potential. As the country continues to grapple with the systemic racism inherent in so many of our political and social institutions we cannot overlook the persistent second-class status of Puerto Rico Guam the American Virgin Islands and other US territories. From 1898 to 1917 the United States acquired territory in Puerto Rico Guam the American Samoan islands and the Virgin Islands through peace settlements ending the Spanish-American War military conquest and a purchase from the Kingdom of Denmark. Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands and Guam all remain unincorporated territories. Adam Harris of The Atlantic writes about the only thing it seems that makes racial integration possible. According to their new report 81 percent of metropolitan regions in the United States with more than 200000 residents were more segregated in 2019 than they were in 1990. Rust Belt cities—Detroit Cleveland Milwaukee—made up a majority of the top 10 most segregated cities. And of the communities that were systematically redlined in the 1930s through federal housing policy 83 percent remain highly segregated. Housing segregation continues to influence school segregation disparities in policing health care and the racial wealth gap. “Racial residential segregation is the glue that holds all these forms of systemic racism together” Menendian told me. “You can’t solve extreme racial inequality in a segregated society.” Does anything seem to work to encourage integration? I asked him. One trend from the project in particular stood out to Menendian. The two most integrated cities they found in the study were Colorado Springs Colorado and Port St. Lucie Florida: two cities with large military presences. The military has long been one of the most integrated institutions in American society. “In those cities—it’s not whether they’re Republican or Democrats blue or red—it just has to do with the fact that there is a deliberate force that creates integration in those communities that breaks down these historical patterns. Tristan Snell asserts in the Washington Post that the papers and documents themselves are more important to the case against the Trump Organization and ultimately Donald Trump himself than the Trump Organization’s CFO Alan Weisselberg. The last time the People of the State of New York took the Trump Organization to court it was in the Trump University case filed in 2013 a civil prosecution I helped lead. Our case featured testimony from Trump University’s executives to be sure — plus the often-heart-rending stories of dozens of defrauded victims — but at its core our case was built on a foundation of documents. In our initial filings alone we attached multiple boxes’ worth of exhibits most importantly the transcripts of Trump University “seminars” as well as the playbook used by its “instructors” financial and human resources records and a large number of internal emails including from people who are now household names like Weisselberg Jeff McConney and Michael Cohen. In the current case there is a veritable feast of documents likely to be available. Emails are only the most obvious example but we also know from Cohen Trump’s former personal attorney that the Trump team frequently kept recorded meetings; there could be audio files (like the now-famous one Cohen recorded regarding hush money for Stormy Daniels) or transcripts or both. Business teleconferences are frequently recorded and archived. If any attendees of a meeting kept notes at the time and that time can be proved — via the metadata showing the time a file was created for example — then those notes can potentially be admissible as evidence.  Ben Casselman of the New York Times reports that automation in some cases has accelerated in some industries die to the Covid-19 pandemic.  An increase in automation especially in service industries may prove to be an economic legacy of the pandemic. Businesses from factories to fast-food outlets to hotels turned to technology last year to keep operations running amid social distancing requirements and contagion fears. Now the outbreak is ebbing in the United States but the difficulty in hiring workers — at least at the wages that employers are used to paying — is providing new momentum for automation. Technological investments that were made in response to the crisis may contribute to a post-pandemic productivity boom allowing for higher wages and faster growth. But some economists say the latest wave of automation could eliminate jobs and erode bargaining power particularly for the lowest-paid workers in a lasting way. “Once a job is automated it’s pretty hard to turn back” said Casey Warman an economist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has studied automation in the pandemic. The trend toward automation predates the pandemic but it has accelerated at what is proving to be a critical moment. The rapid reopening of the economy has led to a surge in demand for waiters hotel maids retail sales clerks and other workers in service industries that had cut their staffs. At the same time government benefits have allowed many people to be selective in the jobs they take. Together those forces have given low-wage workers a rare moment of leverage leading to higher pay more generous benefits and other perks. Vince Beiser of WIRED on the dangers of utilizing concrete in building in light of the collapse of the Surfside Florida condominium complex. Concrete which is essentially just sand and gravel glued together with cement is by far the most widely used building material on earth. We pour enough each year to build a wall 88 feet high and 88 feet wide right around the equator. That’s largely because the number and size of cities is exploding. The number of urban dwellers has more than quadrupled since 1960 to more than 4 billion and it’s still rising. We’re adding the equivalent of 10 New York Cities to the planet every single year.  But none of those structures will last forever. Concrete fails and fractures in dozens of ways. Heat cold chemicals salt and moisture all attack that seemingly solid artificial rock working to weaken and shatter it from within. (Rising temperatures and atmospheric carbon levels are expected to make things worse.) Amy McKinnon and Robbie Gramer of Foreign Policy report that according to a recent survey low morale and attrition continues at the State Department. The survey taken by some 20 percent of the foreign service found that the top concerns driving people to leave were related to their families assignments promotions and bias. Among the perceived drivers of attrition “bias ranked in the top five for all race and ethnicity classifications. Furthermore when looking at African American and American Indian officers bias ranked as the second most important driver for FSO attrition and fourth most important for Hispanic officers” the report states. The report’s analysis of data from the Government Accountability Office shows that between 2003 and 2020 the attrition rate of women and racial and ethnic minorities was roughly on par with that of their white and male counterparts. In April Foreign Policy reported that Blinken appointed career foreign service officer Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Malta to the newly created post of chief diversity and inclusion officer which will report to him directly. Finally today Jana Puglierin of Internationale Politik Quarterly begins to chisel in the legacy of Angela Merkel as a leader of the European Union. Among the things Merkel has most often been accused of is her insistence on maintaining the status quo. Unlike Macron she has never publicly sketched out great visions about the further direction of the European project. Her European policy has been about small predictable steps to manage the many challenges—in other words about changing just enough to keep things as they are. Her reflex was always to prevent the EU from falling apart but without a clear idea about how to move it forward. She successfully adapted the EU to external conditions instead of shaping them. And yet the chancellor has always been aware that the differences in competitiveness within the EU and the eurozone the shortcomings in the construction of the Economic and Monetary Union and the architecture of the Schengen area are unsustainable. In 2012 in a remarkable speech she came  out in favor of a political union—"a European Union with a commission that acts as a European government with the competences we delegate as nation states with a strong European Parliament—which has always grown stronger in the course of European integration—with a Council of Heads of State and Government as a second chamber and with a European Court of Justice as the supreme European authority to which we must then also submit." However since the political reforms that the EU would have needed looked politically impossible to achieve she instead focused on what was acceptable to the majority—in Germany and Europe. At the end of her tenure what stands out is that Merkel was able like no other to bring the European heads of state and government to the table and negotiate with them until a viable solution was found for all. She was the EU’s first crisis manager who steered the EU through the global financial crisis the eurozone crisis the migration crisis through Brexit Trumpism and the COVID-19 pandemic—as a beacon of stability in an ever-more polarized Europe. No other EU leader can credibly fill this void after she is gone at least for now. Everyone have a good morning!
