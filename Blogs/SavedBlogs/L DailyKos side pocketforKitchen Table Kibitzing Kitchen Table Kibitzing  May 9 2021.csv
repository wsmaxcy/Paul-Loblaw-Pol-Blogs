I saw occasional palm trees in arboretums but never in the local environment. After moving to Northern California they became more common; many homes would have a few in their yards and sometimes they would grow along city streets.  When we bought our farm I was determined to have some so I planted six two each of different varieties. They wouldn’t look natural near our old fashioned (1877) farmhouse so I made my palm garden about 1000 feet away. Within a year gophers had dug up and destroyed five of the six. I tended watered and trimmed my dear little palm tree and it survives to this day only about 10 feet tall. Any watering during our dry summers was by gallon jugs carried down into the valley. Our condo complex has palm trees. Some residents love them and I was surprised to discover some hate them. A group of three grows just behind our patio and they are what I see from my window and from the patio. They had never been trimmed.  I visualized how they would look with all the shaggy dead fronds removed. Each frond is heavy and very sharp. Our HOA never has much money so after receiving permission I decided to get it done at my expense. The first bid was outrageous; I said I’d think about it. He called the next day and reduced the bid 80%. I said I’d think about it. Two days later he said “we’d be in the area anyway” (a common ploy) and reduced the bid another 50%. “Go for it” I said. Two young men showed up the next day with proper protective equipment and did a fabulous job.  Now they look the way I think palm trees should look and a few residents complemented the job. Oddly most folks didn’t even notice which surprised me. I couldn’t be more pleased with the results. Speaking of trees on our trip up to Trinidad we hiked through the forest on the Lady Bird Johnson Grove Trail. It includes second-growth trees but segues into the huge old growth areas. I chose this photo of Mrs. side pocket to illustrate the size of the giants which are as wide as the two trees without the space between.
