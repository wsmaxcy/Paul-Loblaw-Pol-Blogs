C, Dictators Gotta Dictate!, Dana Pico, 2020-11-18, When state Governors get away with dictatorial actions once they’ll keep doing it until someone stops them. It is no surprise that those once drunk with power would again imbibe when there were no consequences for the previous drunken spells. As we have previously noted Governor Andy Beshear (D-KY) has gotten away with unconstitutional restrictions on people’s freedoms because the sheeple allowed him to do so. And now proclaiming that COVID-19 is rising too fast he is doing it again. From the Louisville Courier-Journal: By Grace Schneider and Emma Austin | November 18 2020 | 4:19 PM EST | Updated: 4:42 PM EST Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced multiple new restrictions Wednesday as the state continues to see a surge in coronavirus cases including:  Uhhh since when does the state have authority over private schools? Beginning on Friday and lasting until Dec. 13: If the situation is so dire I have to ask why are gyms being allowed to open at all? After all if dining inside a restaurant is too hazardous to be allowed why isn’t working out inside a gymnasium? Outdoor dining is still allowed albeit with restrictions? The low for tonight in Lexington is forecast to drop to 36º F. While Friday Saturday and Sunday have forecast highs in the low sixties starting Monday it gets colder again with daytime highs in the low fifties and nightly lows in the thirties and beginning Saturday the 28th dropping below freezing. Might as well just close ’em down for everything other than take-out. “Indoor gatherings should be limited to two families not exceeding a total of eight people.” If the Governor is stating that gatherings should be limited then he is simply exercising his freedom of speech to ask Kentuckians to do this. If there are some sort of executive orders mandating this then they are in violation of our First Amendment rights of peaceable assembly. And sorry but weddings and funerals are (normally) religious events and no Governor no state no President and no government at any level have the power to prohibit the free exercise of religion. The General Assembly must in its next session this January pass strict limits on the Governor’s emergency powers under KRS 39A. The Governor must never be allowed to attempt to restrict our constitutional rights and in other emergency decrees must have his authority limited to only fourteen days without calling a special session of the state legislature to either pass laws to extend them or revoke the orders. The Governor intoxicated with power as he is had no intention of meeting with the legislature over his decrees: Beshear was asked at Friday’s (July 10 2020 — Editor) news conference on COVID-19 why he has not included the legislature in coming up with his orders. He said many state lawmakers refuse to wear masks and noted that 26 legislators in Mississippi have tested positive for the virus. Translation: he did not believe the General Assembly would give him his way so he was not going to allow them any say in the matter at all.¹ Fortunately the 2020 elections expanded the already strong Republican control in the legislature; the GOP will have veto-proof margins in both houses of the General Assembly. But we really cannot simply wait for the legislature to act; Kentuckians need to protest now to show the legislators that we are opposed to the Governor’s actions.
