L, Live from the GNR Newsroom its the Monday Good News Roundup, JessiestafforGood News, 2021-04-26, Welcome again friends to the Monday Good News Roundup brought to you by the three person team of myself Killer300 and Bhu who are working hard to bring you the good news to start your week off right. So lets jump right into the good news without delay. Once again special thanks to Killer300 and Bhu for getting the stories this week.  t’s not surprising that many of those who best understand the need for court reform are the ones most frustrated by these halting baby steps. As Elie Mystal my colleague Mark Joseph Stern and Ian Millhiser all note it sure feels like the people tasked with taking structural court reform seriously are doing the very opposite. But putting aside the pros and cons of swift and decisive court expansion the persistent fury that the Biden administration isn’t taking the onrushing tyranny of the Trump judiciary seriously may be missing one crucial factor: Court reform doesn’t come exclusively from changing the size and structure of the bench. It can also come informally from the people exerting pressure on the current justices—and there’s good evidence that’s already happening. Indeed even if the Biden administration isn’t taking the steps we would hope they would take to fix the Supreme court doesn’t mean changes aren’t happening. Just be patient.  Like most conservatives I’ve scoffed at the idea of reparations or a formal apology for slavery. I did not own slaves so why would I support my government using my tax dollars for reparations or issuing an apology? Further no one in the United States has been legally enslaved since 1865 so why are Black people today owed anything more than the same freedoms and opportunities that I enjoy?I remain unconvinced that an apology would have much real value but the more substantive notion of reparations is worth discussing. In fact it could be argued that the idea fits within the conservative philosophy. We’ll come back to that. But it is undeniable that White people have disproportionately benefitted from both the labor and the legacy of slavery and — crucially — will continue to do so for generations to come.   So Killer300 thinks this is significant because this guy is a notorious conservative columnist and now he’s coming out in favor of reparations which seems rather significant. I’m inclined to agree.  There are a lot of ways in which complaints about “cancel culture” are insincere or overheated. It is true though that the left is much better at leveraging cultural power to influence corporate actors. Part of that is because key marketing demographics tend to skew younger than Trump’s base of support. Part of it is the changing corporate leadership.But a lot of it is that the left unlike the right has decades of experience in trying to pressure corporations to make change. It understands that doing so takes more than three days of tweets.There is more to talking than just words as Humphrey Bogart once said.   Yeah we’re much better and more committed at boycotting than the other side is which is why we get results and they don’t corporations can see the writing on the wall.  The popularity of the relief bill is a full-on disaster for Republicans. It portends the rise of what the legendary pollster Stanley Greenberg has dubbed “Biden Republicans.” In a profile/interview of Greenberg Politico’s Zack Stanton puts it this way: Like the Reagan Democrats they’re heavily white and live in suburbs. But where the Reagan Dems are blue-collar and culturally conservative Greenberg sees the Biden Republicans as more affluent highly educated and supportive of diversity. Historically they identified with the Republican Party as their political home. But the leaders who were supposed to fight for them seem to care more about white grievance and keeping out immigrants; seem to care more about social issues and “owning the libs” than about child-care payments and college tuition. They don’t consider themselves Democrats—at least not yet—but they are voting for them delivering them majorities in the House and Senate and making Joe Biden just the fourth candidate in the past century to defeat an incumbent president.  Yeah as it turns out “Owning the Libs” is no longer the big winner the GOP thinks it is voters even Republican ones want results. Especially during a crisis. And Biden is giving them just that.  hile the world was distracted with President Donald Trump leaving office on Jan. 20 an obscure Florida company discreetly announced to the world’s computer networks a startling development: It now was managing a huge unused swath of the Internet that for several decades had been owned by the U.S. military.What happened next was stranger still.The company Global Resource Systems LLC kept adding to its zone of control. Soon it had claimed 56 million IP addresses owned by the Pentagon. Three months later the total was nearly 175 million. That’s almost 6 percent of a coveted traditional section of Internet real estate — called IPv4 — where such large chunks are worth billions of dollars on the open market.The entities controlling the largest swaths of the Internet generally are telecommunications giants whose names are familiar: AT&T China Telecom Verizon. But now at the top of the list was Global Resource Systems — a company founded only in September that has no publicly reported federal contracts and no obvious public-facing website.  The greater takeaway is that with Trump gone the DoD is now taking cyberterrorism and internet trouble seriously which is a good thing.  That does it for this week I wish you all a happy healthy Monday and rest of your week.
