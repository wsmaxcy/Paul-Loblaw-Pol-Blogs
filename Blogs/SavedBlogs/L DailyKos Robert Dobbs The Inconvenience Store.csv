L, The Inconvenience Store, Robert Dobbs, 2021-04-30, “We’re out of oatmeal” my wife tells me about every third morning  before breakfast. “And I need more paper towels and the dish soap is  running low so…” “I’ll get it all. Anything else?” She thinks for a moment and adds  another item or two. And then I’m out the front door to our tiny garage.  It holds plenty of junk but has never held a car and lately has become… …our Inconvenience Store. Ignore the t-shirts the disassembled store  fixtures unlabeled plastic tubs cardboard boxes waiting to be  recycled and so much more. Because the left-hand wall is now our go-to resource for all our  domestic needs. One the rude shelving sits pasta oatmeal grains  a great deal of canned food boxes of cocoa jars of peanut butter  and apple sauce powdered milk bottled water household cleaning  supplies and of course toilet paper. The vast oversupply of paper towels? We will not speak of it. It’s  leaving soon. I swear. TP supply is holding at a 60-roll surplus. We’ll  keep it there awhile. We are no doomsday preppers. The Inconvenience Store is a  pass-through surplus not a cache. We restock our kitchen from it daily  making sure each week that the lumbering truck from the supermarket  leaves just a little more than we require. And thus the surplus grows. Someday we’ll let the stock dwindle. Someday the Inconvenience Store  will close. But not today. We’ve needed it this past year. The coming  year will require it as well. You know about the pandemic — let’s just call it a plague. Supply  chain disruption panic buying hoarding: many types of food were  difficult to get especially if you were old and wanted to avoid crowds  of people who didn’t all wear masks. Beyond that our state continues to suffer severe drought. The drought  brought power cutoffs designed to avoid forest fires and finally the  forest fire itself: a giant that burned 80000 acres and licked at the  edge of town. It turned the sky the color of blood oranges. Life wasn’t great even if your house didn’t burn down; you could  always sit in the dark for a days-long power outage while your food  spoiled. Actually life was frightening. We stayed in our house but we had to  set up contingencies to evacuate beyond the river. The fire couldn’t  jump the river — right? In the end we were fine. But the drought and fire risk remain. Even  COVID-19 now in retreat in this country rages elsewhere in the world. A plague’s not unlike a forest fire: if you don’t extinguish it  everywhere it could well roar back. All those mutant COVID-19 strains:  they could learn to evade the vaccines. Who knows what they can do? It was when some journo published the phrase “the mutants will soon  invade the United States…” that I knew we were living in a bad science  fiction novel. The mutants are invading! Actual mutants! That they’re  microscopic is of no consequence. So life will remain science fictional and dangerous — inconvenient.  The Inconvenience Store is here to stay: in the end for  who-knows-how-long. I confess that all my wife and I have suffered so  far is fear and inconvenience. For others it has been much much worse. And the author of this disaster novel is… civilization itself. For  building a world where a world wide plague was absolutely going to  happen and not preparing for it. For spawning global warming and  droughts and famines. For not allowing forests to burn naturally so  that when fires do take hold they are fierce and fast merciless and  deadly. And for favoring the privileged and leaving the poor in danger.  I  admit that I am  privileged compared to many: white college-educated a  homeowner a boomer retired. We built monsters or allowed them to be  built — and took no responsibility. Last August Cedar Rapids IA was devastated by tornadoes — and nobody  cared. The media ignored the suffering of a town of 130000. Because  it’s Cedar Rapids — important to no one on the coasts. I sent a donation  to the Cedar Rapids community foundation with the dedication “From  your fellow disaster survivors in California.” Because we’d been  through a few already. And four days later we were on fire. And the fires will burn until  we all realize that our self interest lies first and foremost in the  well-being of others and of our planet.
