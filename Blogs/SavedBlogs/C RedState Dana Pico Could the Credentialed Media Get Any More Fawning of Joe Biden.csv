C, Could the Credentialed Media Get Any More Fawning of Joe Biden?, Dana Pico, 2020-11-17, The Democrats and their willing allies in the media have attacked President Trump every way of which they could possibly think reasonable or otherwise and I suppose that it worked: they defeated Mr Trump in the 2020 election. Now The Philadelphia Inquirer is praising Joe Biden and slamming the President because Mr Biden has pets while Mr Trump does not: Major and Champ Biden are about to make the White House warm and furry again
by Alfred Lubrano | November 16 2020 Of the more than 500 million Americans who’ve ever lived fewer than four dozen have ascended to the presidency. It’s hard to relate to a group that exclusive. But pets that dig up the Rose Garden chew tassled loafers in the West Wing and have accidents under the Resolute Desk are the great equalizer: There are more Americans who live with animal friends — around 66% studies show — than those who don’t. “Pets humanize presidential figures who seem remote” said Andrew Hager historian-in-residence at the Presidential Pet Museum formerly in Williamsburg Va. now awaiting a new home. “Seeing the most powerful person in the free world romping on the floor with a dog looks so much more like you or I — a very different image than a person in a suit behind a podium.” When he moves into the White House in January the already avuncular President-elect Joe Biden will morph into Romper-in-Chief cavorting with two German shepherds 12-year-old Champ and nearly 3-year-old Major who will become the first shelter animal to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Biden and his grandchildren picked out Major at the no-kill Delaware Humane Association in Wilmington in 2018. For the last four years the White House has been a kibble-free zone. Although President Donald Trump has been accused of emitting racist-rousing dog whistles he hasn’t owned an actual dog. Yeah no bias there huh? My family have pets. We have had cats around for as long as I can remember but until we moved to the farm we never had a dog. Why? Dogs require a lot more room to run around and until we moved here we never had what I thought to be enough room. Now we have the room and my wife brought home a puppy in May of 2019. This summer another dog just moved in. No we didn’t seek him but he just moved in on his own. We have an outdoor feeder for the cats and that has meant that we’ve had ‘visitor’ cats show up to eat as well. Floyd our 21-toed polydactyl cat just showed up skinny as a rail charged in the house when I opened the door and immediately attached himself to my wife. Right now we have four cats two dogs and two chickens plus any other critters which just show up. Living on the border of the Daniel Boone National Forest animals abound here; we see deer on the property frequently and I’ve found bobcat tracks. There are bears and coyotes in the forest and the dogs regularly growl and bark when they sense creatures I cannot see in the National Forest. So I’m not exactly an anti-pet person. Yet President Trump is.  “Donald was not a dog fan” wrote the outgoing president’s first wife Ivana in her memoir Raising Trump. “And Chappy [her poodle] had an equal dislike of Donald.”  Trump is believed to be the only president other than James Polk (in office from 1845 to 1849) not to have a pet Hager said adding “Even the impeached sad racist drunk Andrew Johnson fed flour to mice friends he kept.” To which I say “So what?” Mr Trump long before he became President moved around a lot. He had his suite in Trump Tower in Manhattan his golf course digs in New Jersey and his resort home in Mar-A-Lago in Florida. Believe me it was no fun at all moving four cats from Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania to the farm in Kentucky and we only had to do that once; what would it be like having to move pets around between New York New Jersey and Florida several times a year?  Pets are simply not part of Mr Trump’s lifestyle and he recognized that apparently early on. If he wouldn’t be a good ‘father’ for pets then he shouldn’t have them and chose wisely enough not to do so even though it might have helped him politically. In 2017 Trump reportedly said he was “embarrassed” by the cats snake and rabbit (Marlon Bundo subject of two children’s books) living with Vice President Mike Pence and his family. The Atlantic reported that the menagerie inspired Trump to label the Pences “low-class” and “yokels.” “Animals are so against the Trump Fifth Avenue brand” said Hager who credits Trump for being “self-aware enough” to realize it’s best he avoid bonding with all creatures great and small. In February 2019 the famously germaphobic president said his getting a pet “feels a little phony.” And he apparently wasn’t phony. So now the media are fawning over Mr Biden’s dogs. He adopted from a rescue shelter! He might have named a dog in honor of his late son Beau!  The Inquirer article wasn’t listed as “Lifestyle” or “Human Interest” or “Opinion.” It was presented as a straight news story. Mr Biden hasn’t even taken office yet but The Philadelphia Inquirer is already working on his 2024 re-election campaign.
