L, New Day Cafe:  Wednesday Whimsy, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-06-30, Good morning Cafe!  Hope your day is going well so far. Have a cuppa and a nosh before we begin our whimsical ways this morning!     All are welcome to join the fun the silliness the conversations. If you don’t know...just ask! Some things really do require a bit of explanation. There will be a few surprises along the way all good ones we hope. We are here to keep building the Daily Kos Community. We post Mon-Sun at 10:30 a.m. Eastern. Pie fights will be met with outrageous ridicule and insults. Trolls will be incinerated and served at the next group BBQ.  As briquettes.
