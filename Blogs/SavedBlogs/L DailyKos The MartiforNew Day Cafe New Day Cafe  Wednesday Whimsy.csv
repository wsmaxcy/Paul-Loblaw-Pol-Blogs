L, New Day Cafe:  Wednesday Whimsy, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-07-07, Good Morning Cafe!!  Hope everyone is doing well.  Let’s have a cuppa and something nice to eat before we start.  All are welcome to join the fun the silliness the conversations. If you don’t know...just ask! Some things really do require a bit of explanation. There will be a few surprises along the way all good ones we hope. We are here to keep building the Daily Kos Community. We post Mon-Sun at 10:30 a.m. Eastern. Pie fights will be met with outrageous ridicule and insults. Trolls will be incinerated and served at the next group BBQ.  As briquettes.   This news item came across my desk over the weekend and all I could think was “It just bloody figures!”  On the 2nd of July 1843 (on Sunday) an alligator appeared in downtown Charleston South Carolina. The alligator rained down from the sky according to the Times-Picayune's newspaper clipping in New Orleans. What IS it about Charleston and these danged ‘gators??  They either swim up out of their ponds and go walkabout through the local drive-through restaurants or they wander up on the porch mooching a meal.  And now...Gatornados!  I’m tellin’ yez...it’s a plot! . Happy Anniversary to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.  They’ve been married for 75 years!!!  They are an inspiration!
