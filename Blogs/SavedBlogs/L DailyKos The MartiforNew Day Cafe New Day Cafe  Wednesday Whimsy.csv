L, New Day Cafe:  Wednesday Whimsy, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-04-28, Good morning Cafe! Yesterday I treated you to some freshly minted ‘awwww’ pics.  Today...I got somethin’ diffrunt! First though…  OOPsie!  That’s tea and sandwitches.  My bad.  We get choices this morning!  Toast of the French variety….or those tasty little numbers from the French Quarter!  OK so I heard an old Nat King Cole song that is being used in a commercial.  And it reminded me how many great songs he did that we just don’t hear these days. So in the interests of “mellow” I give you the original “King.” / It was only a Pink Moon last night!
