L, New Day Cafe:  Wednesday Whimsy, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-05-05, Good morning Cafe!   I’m doing this in the early early of the morning because I can….and because I fell asleep last night before I could even think about doing it!  SLEEP!!! Oh blessed sleep!!!  After months of wrestling with insomnia I cannot express how wonderful it has been to be sleepy...and to be able to sleep! So let’s get some coffee and noms and see what’s shakin’! We haz a issue here….we’re out of cat fud.  Shadow First Of His Name has had to contend with toona chickin and rice cooked in salmon.  Since he et alllll the leftovers and such a run to the pet store is on tap for the moment they open.  If I’m late this morning...that’s why.  He has made his displeasure known!  Hongry?  Me too!  So what’s our whimsy for today?  I think I’ve mentioned my love of Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes cartoons from time to time.  These days on MeTV (Memorable Entertainment TV) there is a new programme in the mornings that shows classice Bugs Bunny Popeye and Tom and Jerry cartoons.  (It’s better on the weekends when each one gets a whole hour to themselves!!)  This week they’re showing The Best Of Bugs...all of the best and some interesting trivia about the beginnings of the iconic wascally wabbit and his nemesis Elmer Fudd. Did you know the origin of Bugs?  Well….though a similar character first appeared in the WB cartoon Porky's Hare Hunt (1938) and a few subsequent shorts the definitive characterization of Bugs Bunny is widely credited to have debuted in director Tex Avery's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare (1940).[1]  Both of those cartoons were shown on Tuesday morning’s show.  They also solved the mystery of how Bugs got his name: The rabbit's third appearance comes in Hare-um Scare-um (1939).  Charlie Thorson lead animator on the film gave the character a name. He had written "Bugs' Bunny" on the model sheet that he drew for Hardaway.[10][13] In promotional material for the cartoon including a surviving 1939 presskit the name on the model sheet was altered to become the rabbit's own name: "Bugs" Bunny (quotation marks only used on and off until 1944).  So thanks to a scrawled note on a sketch….Bugs Bunny got his name.  Also of note is that Bob Clampett worked in the same studio.  Clampett was later famous for his own “Beany and Cecil”  Beany and Cecil is a 1962 animated television series created by Bob Clampett for the American Broadcasting Company.[1] The cartoon was based on the television puppet show Time for Beany which Clampett produced for Paramount Pictures company and its Paramount Television Network beginning 1949.  The series I remember began in January 1962.  I was a mere moppet but was just nutz for Cecil the seasick sea serpent!  This morning they did some of the classic musical toons including one of the very best….enjoy!
