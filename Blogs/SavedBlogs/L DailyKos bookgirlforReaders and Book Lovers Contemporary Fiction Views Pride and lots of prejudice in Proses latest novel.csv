L, Contemporary Fiction Views: Pride and lots of prejudice in Prose's latest novel, bookgirlforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-06-29, One of the stranger plots which shouldn't work but mostly does is the plot of Francine Prose's 22nd novel The Vixen which was published today. The young narrator is working at his first job out of college as a slush pile reader for a prestigious publisher in the 1950s. Simon receives the most conflicting assignment he can imagine. His mother was a schoolmate of Ethel Rosenberg. The book begins with the Rosenbergs being executed and Simon watching the live TV converage with his parents. Not recommended for grad school by the professor whose work he adores our Harvard grad is able to get on at the publishing house because of his uncle a horrible man and feared literary critic. For months Simon toils in obscurity reading slush pile rejects with titles such as The Igloo Lover Herod's Daughter The Laboratory Mice's Revenge and I Barbarian. His boss the charismatic Warren assigns him to edit a novel in utter secrecy. Its title is little better than the slush piles ones. It's The Vixen the Patriot and the Fanatic. It's a thinly disguised rewrite of the actual Rosenbergs now named Esther and Junius Rosenstein. Esther is a sex fiend and Mata Hari. No man can resist her including the prosecutor assigned to her case. Warren wants to publish the novel because he's certain it will make a mint and save the publishing house. Simon is going to have to decide what he will and will not do and whether he has any integrity. He also has to decide if he has any loyalty left to his parents who revere the Rosenbergs even though the American public caught up in McCarthyism seem determined to revile the couple even in death. Not that Simon was ever in charge of what's going on but the longer he works on the novel the more out of control he becomes. The Vixen swings back and forth between a satire of the 1950s publishing industry including all the Mad Men tropes one would expect from the height of the three-martini lunch era to Simon's belated coming-of-age. Prose is able to do both. The bad advice Simon gets from older men of the world is depicted in particularly striking passages. Perhaps this duality works best if one reads Simon's first-person narration in Mark Linn-Baker's voice as the character he played in My Favorite Year. In that Peter O'Toole movie Linn-Baker plays the earnest young man who wants a career in television and gets the dreaded assignment of keeping the hard-drinking movie star sober for a live TV show appearance. The sensibilities of the novel and the movie are similar with both poking fun but also wanting to tell a more heartfelt story. The suspension of disbelief that is shaky is the use of the Rosenbergs. It's hard to balance using them as symbols of the anti-Communist hysteria of the era who become a sex maniac and impotent husband with the way the main character's mother idolized her schoolmate. It's not that the two ideas cannot exist in the same story. It's the two tones living together in harmony that is more difficult to achieve. That isn't Prose's focus however. She is using the idea of the Rosenbergs and the idea of whether a decent novel can be crafted out of a sleazy one designed to make a lot of quick bucks as a way for a young man to question pride. Pride in family pride in professional ability pride in editing a person or a book pride in becoming one's own person pride in having integrity. Simon’s college days focused on old Viking sagas ancient folklore stories of monsters and creatures that changed their appearance.  When Simon is finally told a crucial piece of information — one that will probably not surprise the reader — he realizes that those old stories he loves so much “were lessons about how little we know each other.” And let’s face it ourselves. Also with Florida’s governor now demanding to know the political views of those at colleges in the state reading a book that deals with McCarthyism is timely. The way various characters in this novel are adamant to condemn the executed Rosenbergs shows how well groupthink works for authoritarians.
