L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Dan Severson, republicinsanity, 2021-05-05, Welcome to what is the 984th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Dan Severson a 2020 Republican candidate for Florida’s 19th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives resurfacing in American politics for the first time since 2014. After serving for 8 years in the Minnesota state legislature after first winning office in the 2002 elections Severson managed to somehow buck the trend of the GOP storming into office in the 2010 Tea Party Wave while Republicans won that year up and down the ballot. He lost  his attempt that year to be elected Minnesota Secretary of State completely floundered in a bid for U.S. Senate in 2012 and lost again in 2014 in his second attempt to be elected Minnesota Secretary of State. He gave up on winning office in the Land of 10000 Lakes instead working as a member of the Trump 2016 campaign team in Ohio before traveling thousands of miles further south to Florida in 2017 and hoping he could restart a career in politics in 2020 completely rebranding himself in Trump’s xenophobic brand whether it be calling for his stupid border wall to be built along the U.S./Mexico border grousing about “bird-killing wind turbines” and blaming the woes of the country on “ANTIFA”. More importantly Severson was but the latest in a far-too-long line of Republicans who were trying to ride the Qanon conspiracy theory to a win in a Congressional race in 2020 linking posts on Twitter with the Qanon hashtag as late as March of 2020. Not that it helped him much.Dan Severson’s campaign would see him spend six figure sums of his own money trying to succeed Congressman Francis Rooney for his seat in FL-19 but he finished 7th out of a possible nine candidates in the GOP Primary for the seat. It is unsure if we’ve seen the last of him in American politics at this time or not but for now he’s been kept out of power.       One Year Ago May 4th 2020: Monica Youngblood (NM)Two Years Ago May 4th 2019: Christy Perry (ID)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago May 4th 2018: Christy Perry (ID)… 2018 Update  Four Years Ago May 4th 2017: Christy Perry (ID)… 2017 Update Five Years Ago.
