L, Crazed White-wing Mom claims CRT will make "Antifa Kids" attack her children, Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-07-07, Sometimes you think the cake has been taken and then you experience things like this.  During an interview with anti-critical race theory activist Elana Fishbein Reeve asked why she was so fearful about her children being taught about racism in the United States. "This is my taxpayer money I don't want it to go to indoctrinate kids that will hate my kids because of the color of their skin and attack them!" she said. "It twisted the minds of all kids -- my kids can be attacked by Antifa kids or BLM kids if they are not Black!" Reeve then asked her if any "Antifa kids" had actually physically assaulted her children. "Were your children beat up by Antifa kids?" she asked. "I beg your pardon?" replied Fishbein. "I'm talking it's going to happen if we are not going to stop it!" she replied. "But we are going to stop it. We are the great majority of this country!" Not that shockingly this isn't Dr. Fishbein’s only trip around the crazy bush. Here is Dr. Fishbein who has formed a “grassroots” organization called “No Left Turn in Eduation” talking to an equally stable personality Dana Loesch of NRA Tv which she scored after an appearance on Tucker. Dr. Fishbein argues that she received a “cultural proficiency” notice regarding her grade-school age children which she considered to be “Marxist indoctrination” and when she brought it up before the school board she was — shockingly — called “all the names they call Conservatives - like Racist.” Wow. Imagine that. Fishbein states “It doesn't make sense base on my professional background that this kind of learning is in our public schools.”  After this she contacted other parents who apparently supported her hair-brained ideas and started a Facebook group.    She claims in her talk with Loesch that Planned Parenthood and comprehensive sex education is dangerous “because they are undermining the very foundation of human existence.” Seriously? This is from her introduction to the group. This past Spring I decided to withdraw my children from the local public school and transfer them to a private school for the Fall.  In June shortly after the death of George Floyd and the protests rioting and looting that ensued the principal of my children’s elementary school issued a message to parents that shocked me.  It described a hastily drawn up plan by a “Cultural Proficiency Committee” at the school “to offer explicit lessons on equity and race for our students.”  Despite the fact that the school already offers a robust curriculum that includes five distinct programs (plus Black History Month) to help foster empathy understanding and compassion in students they felt an urgent need to execute additional lessons in “cultural proficiency” to children starting in kindergarten two days before the conclusion of the school year.  These lessons included topics such as “diversity” “racism” “justice” “equity” and “privilege”.  But instead of reaffirming and fostering the wholesome teaching of MLK Jr. the lessons in this new “cultural proficiency” unit incorporated specific books that described “whiteness” as an entitlement to steal land garner riches and get special treatment.  I opted my children out of these classes as well. Although our children will not be returning to the public school I feel strongly that progressive indoctrination in the education system is having a devastating impact on our community and our nation.  When the school year concluded I wrote a letter to the superintendent of our school district (Lower Merion School District - LMSD) to the school board and the school principal.  In it I expressed my indignation that the school is purposefully programming impressionable young children into the “woke” culture and I questioned the validity of such teaching (see copy in the About section).  To date I’m still awaiting a reply.  Five weeks later I posted that letter to the group FB page of the school’s parents and expected to generate a serious and thoughtful discussion.  Instead I was met with derision from a handful - but vocal - liberal parents.  More importantly though I found a significantly large groundswell of support from families within my immediate community and beyond.  They reached out to me privately alarmed by the infiltration of progressive ideology into public education.  So many of them shared their stories how liberal friends colleagues and even family members shunned them for rejecting the leftist wave determined to take over the country.  So they stayed low. Silent. Fearful of the social occupational and economic consequences that might result from expressing opposing values.   It was then that I realized that we needed a voice.  I created the No Left Turn Movement to be that voice.  A voice to push back on the Progressive agenda sweeping into public education and to underscore the ideals and values that make our country exceptional. There are thousands in our community and surely millions in our country who feel as we do and are willing to win back our schools from those who try to poison young minds.  For the record. none of this is Critical Race Theory because that isn't taught in grade school it’s a course in graduate and law schools.  I do have a concern that many schools may indeed be over-reacting and pushing these types of cultural issues on children that are far too young to fully comprehend them.  That’s a fair point but the level and depth of her reaction is also completely out of whack with that issue. Does she know that Dr. King stated that "A riot is the language of the unheard?” He also said that the “Cry of Black Power is at bottom a reaction to the reluctance of White Power to make the kind of changes necessary to make justice a reality for the Negro.  A riot is the language of the unheard and what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the economic plight of the Negro has worsened over the last few years.” Her problem is essentially that they were teaching that whiteness is a privilege and has been a privilege for centuries.  She didn’t want not just her children but ANY children to learn the actual accurate history of white people in the country.  Sorry but slavery didn't just magically happen without people — yes white people — implementing it for their own financial benefit.  They didn't keep it going after the Civil War and through reconstruction using the Black Codes in defiance of the 14th and 15th Amendments.  They wouldn't have implemented Jim Crow or let KKK Terrorists pillage and murder for the next century. The Trail of Tears wasn't a mistake. The Internment of Japanese Americans and the Tuskegee experiment didn't happen in the 19th Century — it was in the 20th. They wouldn't have blocked access to the vote implemented racial red-lines discriminated in housing lending and in the Justice System where hundreds of unarmed black men have been shoot down and choked out in the streets. She thinks learned this will turn “Antifa Kids” against her children.  She thinks that they’ll be ridiculed and attacked — the way the Jewish people have been attacked following the latest violence in Gaza and the way that Asian people have been attacked following the complaints about the "China Virus.” She’s afraid that her kids will get treated the exact same way that every other minority in this nation is treated. I'm glad that doesn't happen.  I’m glad that her kids don't have to carry the burden of the worst examples of their race or of their history.  I mean who would even think it's reasonable or appropriate to do such a thing to someone else? Oh wait.  I remember. Privileged white people. White kids are being taught that they aren't perfect? White kids are being told that their ancestors made mistakes? Well to me that sounds like everything that minority kids are taught each and every day.  That sounds like leveling the playing field. History is not a limit on what the future can bring.   It can teach things to emulate but it can also teach things NOT TO DO.  I’ve said this before but you can learn from more than just the slavers you can learn from the abolitionists — who were also white.  You can learn from those who fought Jim Crow and segregation.  You can make a decision about what you want the world - and the nation - to become and reflect. Do you want more white privilege or do you want actual equality? Apparently Dr. Fishbein wants to keep her— and her children's — blind ignorant privilege.  Just for the record for those who can't watch the video Dr Fishbein has a significant foreign accent.  This means depending on who her partner is that her children may be first generation Americans without any ancestral link to Southern Slavery Jim Crow or previous instances of segregation.  This means that she thinks "Antifa kids” are going to attack them purely on the basis of skin color alone. Apparently she doesn't realize that most "Antifa Kids" are also white.  I just fixed the link to the Facebook page I do suggest many gentle commenters go over and drop a vew nuggets of actual knowledge — politely of course.  Here are some of the details from the North Penn School District Cultural Proficiency program which is what set Dr. Fishbein off on her tear.
