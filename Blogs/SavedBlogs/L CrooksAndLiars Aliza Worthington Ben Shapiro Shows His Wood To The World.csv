L, Ben Shapiro Shows His Wood To The World, Aliza Worthington, 04-23-21, People. Honestly every once in a while Ben Shapiro is just a gift. Mostly he's that twat who argued with his AP Chem teacher that he deserved a 100% instead of a 98% on the test. But today...today friends he is a gift. how is this not satire? pic.twitter.com/iUBmPoWl6J ‚Äî Piper Ramsey-Sumner (@cbfplr) April 22 2021 What's this all about you ask? the context doesn‚Äôt help pic.twitter.com/g7bUt1Lvwe ‚Äî Piper Ramsey-Sumner (@cbfplr) April 22 2021 There. All better?  No. No it makes exactly zero sense at all and he thinks he is owning the libs by spending $3 on a pre-cut board at a store whose owner loves TraitorTrump. Maybe MAYBE if he'd come out of there wheeling $20000 in appliances or riding mowers it would have helped his point more. But Ben Shapiro whose net worth is upwards of $25 million spending approximately three bucks at Home Depot on a BOARD that he'll probably have someone cut in half so he can stack them and use as a booster seat isn't exactly what one would call activism. The real gift of course was the reaction from the Twitterverse. ‚ÄúHoney I will be down in my workshop doing lumber things.‚Äù‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a workshop.
