L, Call to Action: Trump’s Gone But Voters’ Work Is Half-Done, FP Dunneagin, 2021-04-19, In the 2018 mid-term elections Democratic voters powered the Blue Wave overthrowing the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. In the 2020 presidential elections and by a stunning seven million vote majority presidential voters turned out the most incompetent and corrupt president in American history. Voters also assured a slim Democratic majority in the Senate ending Republicans’ control of that body and the federal government.  However since the 2020 election Republicans in the House and Senate and many state legislatures have demonstrated that the work voters began in 2018 furthered in 2020 remains unfinished. For voters interested in responsible governance and those who want to complete the job of removing anti-democratic Republicans from elective office the upcoming 2022-2024 elections are a call to action. Since last November’s elections Congressional Republicans continue to demonstrate their allegiance to the former president despite losing the Senate majority and the presidency. As a result of their Faustian bargain with Trump they find themselves stuck with an ignorant authoritarian wannabe claiming to lead their party. Consequently their twin foci on fostering anti-democratic dysfunction and obstructing President Biden’s government have rendered them incapable of formulating responsible policy initiatives to counter the extremely popular programmatic and legislative blitz waged by President Biden. As James Downie wrote in The Washington Post “Republicans have drawn a blank on basic governance.”  Despite the immense public support for President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Sen. John Thune (R-SD) the Republican Minority Whip called the covid rescue legislation “mostly just a collection of payoffs to Democrat interest groups and Democrat states.”  And what did Republicans offer Americans desperate for financial relief from the economic devastation inflicted by the coronavirus?  A proposal by Sen. Thune to repeal the estate tax – a tax repeal for which only 1900 American households qualified for in 2018 according to a study by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.  The Republicans’ narrowly focused proposal exemplifies their deepening estrangement from responsible governance. Following Republicans’ substance-free denunciation of President Biden’s covid relief legislation Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) the Senate Minority Leader announced that Republicans would not support the president’s infrastructure proposal.  Sen. McConnell vowed to oppose the bill “every step of the way” and subsequently called the proposal nothing more than a “whopping tax increase” of corporate tax rates. Yes this is the same Sen. McConnell who stated that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “[had] been very good for the economy.” However a report from the independent nonpartisan Congressional Research Service made it clear that the 2017 tax cuts did not work. The CRS report also made clear that due to the 2018 tax cuts the federal government incurred massive deficits while wealth inequality increased to its highest level in three decades. In the aftermath of the 2020 elections Republican legislators continue to support Trump and his big lie. They are radicalizing against democracy using that lie as a pretext to pass voting reform laws.   As Georgia’s Republican governor Brian Kemp revealed these laws have nothing to do with Trump’s potential voter fraud claims in the 2020 elections. Said Gov. Kemp “A lot of this bill is dealing with the mechanics of the election. It has nothing to do with potential fraud or not." Kemp argued that claims of “suppression” and labels of “Jim Crow 2.0” is based on “blatant misinformation.” Nation-wide Republican-controlled state legislatures have authored 361 bills in 47 states intended to make it harder to vote after an election in which there was record turnout — and zero evidence of any significant fraud.  As Vox points out “The fundamental truth about SB 202 [Georgia’s new voting law] is this: Its very existence is predicated on a lie. The bill’s passage was motivated by unfounded claims of fraud in the Georgia presidential elections — lies that Donald Trump spread and continues to spread with the help of both state and national Republicans.” In the 2018 mid-term elections an estimated 113 million people participated. The 2018 mid-term voter turnout was the largest mid-term voter turnout since 1966.  More votes were cast in the 2020 presidential election than in any other U.S. election in history:  Joe Biden earned more than 81 million votes defeating Trump by more than 7 million votes. In 2022-2024 the stakes will be even more significant. Republican legislators at all levels have signed onto Trump’s big lie and demonstrated their willingness to cast democracy aside to assure their political survival.  But as the rising voter totals from 2018 and 2020 show Republicans are fighting a losing battle: recent Gallup poll results show Republicans trailing Democrats by nine percentage points (49% to 40%) among those who self-identify with a political party. As the Gallup organization notes “The nine-percentage-point Democratic advantage is the largest Gallup has measured since the fourth quarter of 2012.” What is the cure-all for ending the nuttiness and tyranny of the Republican minority and their ever-escalating threat to democracy?  Voters must accept the call to action the 2022-2024 election will lay before us.  We must continue to vote — vote like our lives and our democracy depends on it. We must enable Democrats to use that nine-point advantage to make Republicans pay the price their incompetent attempt at governance and anti-democratic tyranny rightfully warrants.
