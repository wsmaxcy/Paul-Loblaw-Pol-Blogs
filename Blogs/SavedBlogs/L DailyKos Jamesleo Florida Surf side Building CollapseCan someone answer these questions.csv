L, Florida: Surf side Building CollapseCan someone answer these questions, Jamesleo, 2021-06-27, I must confess I have preconceived notions about Florida ! I have always believed its a “free for all state”; with lax regulations  with little or no enforcement. I live in New York State. We are highly regualted with inspections reviews corrective action. Yes I am a retired bureaucrat with NYSDOH. I as part of my job reviewed leases  Certificate of Occupancy insurances etc.  The more I read about the details about the Surf side Building Collapse the more confused I become. 1: Why did the building/management company  and not the insurance company (Great American Insurance Carrier) commission the Engineering Company Morabito Consultants to conduct the inspection 2: How was the management company able to convince the tenants that the building was safe  in spite  of this inspection (which indicated 9 Million Dollars in Repairs was needed to correct the weakening cement blocks 3: It appears that the carrier Great American was not aware of the findings? That does not make sense as they may have to pay out millions in claims! 4: Is this “business as usual” in Florida Real Estate/building management 5: Rising sea levels mean incidents like the Surf-side collapse will only increase. Salt water is very corrosive  I can imagine a scenario where the insurance companies throw their hands in the air and say”This isn’t worth it. I imagine premiums will increase on the Florida coastline after the actuaries do the math Thank you www.theinsurer.com/…  www.huffpost.com/...
