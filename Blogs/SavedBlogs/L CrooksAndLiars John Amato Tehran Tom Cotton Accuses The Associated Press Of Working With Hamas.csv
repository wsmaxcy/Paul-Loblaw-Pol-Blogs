L, 'Tehran Tom' Cotton Accuses The Associated Press Of Working With Hamas, John Amato, 2021-05-17, The GOP supports nothing but fear mongering white supremacy and wild conspiracy theories. Sen. Tom Cotton led the way Monday by claiming with no proof that the Associated Press is in cahoots with Hamas against Israel. On Sunday Israeli gave a one hour notice to all occupants to vacate a building in Gaza before they bombed and demolished said building that the AP and several other news outlets worked in for 15 years claiming it was a Hamas military stronghold.  The Associated Press was horrified that Netanyahu took this action. The news agency’s camera offered 24-hour live shots as militants’ rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surrounding area this week. “We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building” AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said in a statement. “This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.” Cut to the Senate chamber: On the Senate floor Sen. Cotton said "Why is the Associated Press sharing the building with Hamas? Surely these intrepid reporters knew who their neighbors were. Did they knowingly allow themselves to be human shields by US designated terrorist organization?" Sen. Cotton had no proof of this outrageous claim except for the Israeli Prime Minister's word -- a guy who can't even form a government at this time. "Did the AP pull its punches? And declined to report for years on Hamas's misdeeds I submit that the AP has some uncomfortable questions to answer" Cotton said. Sen. Cotton then alleged that the Associated Press was colluding with Hamas and conspiring with them to gaslight Hamas' violent actions. Again this is the kind of destructive rhetoric and wild accusations from a sitting Senator that gets people and journalists killed.  Karoli adds: There are so many reasons to doubt that there was a Hamas stronghold. Why would Israel warn Hamas to evacuate the building so they could bomb it? Why would Hamas decide to hang out with the BBC AP and Al Jazeera? The whole story smells but there's Tehran Tom standing tall because the Biden administration is trying to work out a deal with Iran again.
