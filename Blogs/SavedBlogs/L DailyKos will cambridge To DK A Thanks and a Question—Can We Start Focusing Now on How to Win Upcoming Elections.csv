L, To DK: A Thanks and a Question—Can We Start Focusing Now on How to Win Upcoming Elections?, will cambridge, 2021-05-09, It’s been a tough year-plus and first off I want to say a thank-you to this blog. It’s been a big part of my life through these tough events beginning with the coronavirus. As the thing first started and I had to grapple with the prospect of disease waiting outside my front door the writers on this blog had the bravery to look at the situation clearly take it for what it was and provide useful commentary. I remember reading Mark Sumner’s comments about how he would prepare to go “into the hot zone” when he would leave his home to run errands. Those comments helped me wrap my mind around the problem. I also remember him saying “there will be a before-time and an after-time”. He sure nailed that one. Anyway in general the writers here were extremely helpful on that issue. I also valued this blog’s coverage on all issues related to the election and the events of January 6 as well as those were extremely troubling times for me and this blog helped me keep informed about the fight to maintain our country’s democracy a fight that thankfully was successful—although the fight goes on. And that brings me to my question. Can we start talking about how we’re going to win the next elections? I find myself puzzled recently seeing the attitude on this site and elsewhere that Democrats are going to have a lot of trouble in the upcoming Congressional elections of 2022. As I understand the rationale is two-fold: One Republicans control a lot of re-districting and thus can draw Congressional districts to their favor. That obviously sounds like a real issue. But can we talk about it in more detail please. Redistricting is an ongoing process so what exactly are the issues right now. The second issue appears to be the historical trend that after a party wins the White House they often do poorly in the next Congressional election cycle. This is where I want to push back and say: Come on everybody. That’s not a reason. It’s certainly not a foregone conclusion. Presumably it would be based on voters being unhappy with the way the President and his party had performed. Well…How about we govern so as to make voters happy instead. And then campaign on that. How does that sound? Does that sound do-able? I think it’s very do-able. And there’s another trend that I feel like is being overlooked. Democrats—and I refer loosely to the coalition that includes more than just Democrats the coalition that doesn’t believe in lies doesn’t want to overthrow elections on the basis of made-up claims the people who recognize that that would throw the country into dictatorship and don’t want to go there—that coalition just democratically (small-D) unseated an incumbent President held the house and flipped the Senate including two seats in Georgia of all places. That is the coalition that is now saying “Whoa looks like next cycle’s gonna be tough.” Seriously? It’s like the football team that won the Super Bowl went out and said “Regretfully our assistant equipment-ordering staffer is leaving the team so we’re afraid it’s going to be a tough season next year and frankly we may not even break even.” Seriously? Why? Are there real challenges? I know we’re the reality-based community. I’m not asking to ignore the realities not for a second. But I would like to hear in detail what the challenges are. And I’m really hoping this community will start doing what I’ve seen it do best—mobilize to overcome the challenges support successful governing campaign get out the vote and win for the betterment of democratic society. This is a strong community. We have truth and a commitment to reality on our side as well as a commitment to strong positive values and all those things are extremely powerful. And the other side wants to overthrow elections. I don’t think they’re going to win a lot of votes with that message. As for the “overthrow” part bottom line we stopped it once we can do it again. Here’s where I’m at. With my career and family life I’m not as active in these things as I once was—but I did more recently than I have in quite a while. I donated significantly to the Presidential and other races. And on Election Day I signed on with the Biden campaign (virtually) and did GOTV. So I’m doing much less than some I know. But more than zero. And I’m ready to do it again and then some potentially if the need is there and the problem-solvers are there asking for help. These are the election cycles I want to win: 2020: Done 2021 January: Done 2021 off-year 2022 2023 2024 And all the rest. Until we get back to a society where the person who loses the election calls the winner and says great campaign good luck governing we’ll see you in the next one. So I’m asking this blog: Can we start talking about upcoming elections and getting a plan for victory together please? I’m ready. Who else is ready?
