L, Breathe..., vjr7121, 2021-04-21, It seems a bit ironic to use the phrase that has been repeated throughout the day but here goes I was holding my breath all day  In fact after watching reports of the Chauvin trial for the murder of George Floyd as a nation we’ve been holding our breath for all too long.  The testimony we heard over the course of his trial begged the question that was so much on our mind since George Floyd had the life choked out of him last May 25th: “Can this be happening again?”  Of course it can and will continue to happen until those of us who refuse to even admit that there is a problem...that it is much more likely that one of us will die at the hands of a police officer if our skin color is black.  With the word “guilty” repeated three times by a Minnesota judge this may be the time to take back our nation and yes build policing back better.   In these first days of the Biden term it has become abundantly clear that this time we chose the right man for these times.  Joe just gets it.  His words after the verdict was recorded were spot on—there was no joy in this verdict only justice.  Sending a man to jail likely for the rest of his life is no reason to celebrate but it is a time to reflect on why we held our breath today. The nation was spared more violence today due to the pluck of a prescient teenager who had the wherewithal to record a most brutal murder.  Does anyone believe that Derek Chauvin would be going to prison if that tape had not existed?  If only there was a recording for Breonna Taylor or Freddie Gray or Trayvon Martin one might wonder.  Wait! In other cases there have been recordings and those recordings have not had the same impact as the 9-minute 29-second video recorded by Darnella Frazier.  There were police bodycam recordings that captured Eric Garner’s last breaths and Tamir Rice’s death.  It was a video that recorded the shooting death of Walter Scott the South Carolina man who was shot five times in the back after a traffic stop for a broken brake light.  But for the video shot by a bystander in that case the police officer Michael Slager  would not have been convicted and imprisoned for 20 years—to date the harshest penalty meted out to a police officer for the murder of an unarmed black man. Frazier’s cell phone testimonial became our eyes and ears as we all watched George Floyd beg for his life for over 9 minutes.  We heard him call out for his deceased mother with his final breaths as his murderer looked us in the eye daring us to stop him.  If not for the uniform and four other police officers looking on as accomplices maybe one of us would have intervened and saved George Floyd’s life.  The uniform and the badge tell us to trust that what we are seeing is just.  But that trust has been breached of late the belief that the men and women wearing those badges  are there to protect us...to serve us is not shared by those in black communities. Since 2015 officers sworn to protect them have fatally shot at least 135 unarmed Black men women and children nationwide. We have learned that not even video recordings will not stop this from occurring again:   As much as we are focused on discerning whether the actions of police officers can be justified the fact that so many of these encounters end in the death of an unarmed victim reminds us that the system is broken. Yesterday America held its breath as a jury deliberated the verdict that seemed so obvious and yet so much in doubt. That cold stare of the defendant into our eyes as his knee slowly and deliberately squeezed the life out of his victim will be etched in the national psyche for days or maybe a month.  But as life goes on for most of us blacks in America will continue to hold their breath each time their child leaves the home whenever they hear a siren wail in the distance or as they look into the cold empty stare of a peace officer with gun drawn approaching them.  They will replay the recording of a parent telling them what to do what to say “don’t resist”... They will make a split-second judgment as to whether this is a good or bad cop.  As their hearts race and the fight or flight instinct takes over a black man will weigh the same choices as those made by George Floyd and Daunte Wright and Walter Scott---do I run or do I stay?--- knowing that either choice may be fraught with danger that each breath may be their last.  Sad to say that in America for far too many blacks the danger doesn’t begin the moment they leave their home that day or the instant they choose to comply or defy a policeman’s order to stop.  Sadly in America the danger is coded in our nation’s DNA it began with the decision to allow some of us to be owned by another or when we denied some of us the right to vote. To be black in many places in America is to be endangered. No as a sad matter of fact it begins anew the moment a black child takes his or her first breath...
