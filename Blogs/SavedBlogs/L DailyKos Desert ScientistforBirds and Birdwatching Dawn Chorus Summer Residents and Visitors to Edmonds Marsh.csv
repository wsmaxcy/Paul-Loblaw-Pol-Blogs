L, Dawn Chorus: Summer Residents and Visitors to Edmonds Marsh, Desert ScientistforBirds and Birdwatching, 2021-06-27, The summer doldrums have set in as migrants leave the area and resident birds take front and center. Edmonds Marsh continues to amaze despite the drop in species with the visit of a White-rumped  Sandpiper (which I missed completely) and a Long-billed Dowitcher (which I saw). I also got a look at a Western Wood Pewee that had perched on a fence along the main path. We get a few flycatcher types around this time of year.  The locals include some resplendent male Anna’s Hummingbirds a few Great Blue Herons Marsh Wrens the various Swallows (Tree Violet-green Barn Rough-winged and Purple Martin) Song Sparrows Bewick’s Wrens House Finches Bald Eagles European Starlings Red-winged Blackbirds and of course American Crows. The male Anna’s Hummingbirds that often hang around the boardwalk area are especially conspicuous and I have occasionally seen them do their remarkable flight display earlier in the year.  They often perch on cattails or nearby trees along the boardwalk. If the light is right the bright magenta gorget is on full view and there are few birds that can compete for absolute brilliance of color.  Of course there are always Song Sparrows at just about any time of year. I have been occasionally fooled for a short time when they act like Marsh Wrens holding their tails cocked and bouncing in between the cattails. While the Red-wing Blackbird males are less active they still occasionally were displaying in the cattails. And once this bird has started singing you know right away what it is. The Marsh Wren males often use a cattail for a singing platform.  American Crows were almost always in evidence this time with a begging juvenile. Swallows are hard to photograph until the settle on a snag or electric line. This male Violet-green Swallow rested briefly on a snag. House Finches are also residents and can often be found foraging for seeds or on trees.  As I mentioned I did see a Western Wood Pewee perched on a fence along the path. I hoped that more flycatchers would show up and some have but I have not seen them. In addition to the White-rumped Sandpiper we had a visit from a Long-billed Dowitcher. I never got close enough for a really good shot but its identity was obvious. Great Blue Herons have been rarer as the weather warmed but they showed up occasionally. And of course there was our old standard the Black-capped Chickadee. So what birds are you seeing?
