L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Anthony Kern- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-25, On this date in 2018 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” published its original profile of Anthony Kern a member of the Arizona House of Representatives from District 20 who was first elected to office in 2014 usually by running second behind fellow GOP legislator Paul Boyer in that district. It wasn’t until Kern was into his second term in office that he managed to earn our notice here at CSGOPOTD and that’s because only a few weeks after he was sworn in he decided to go to a Trump rally in Phoenix to speak and where he brought out the “LOCK HER UP!” rhetoric against Hillary Clinton four months after the election not just as a colorful chant but something he actually suggested needed to be revisited as an actual policy. More interesting was that this rally featured several members of the anti-government militia group the Oathkeepers and people baying out other great opinions like beginning “liberal genocide” and the deportation of either all Muslims or all Jews from America. Y’know nothing that would seem at all like the sort of thing Neo-Nazis would be yelling out loud unprompted. That wasn’t the first time Kern faced some sort of controversy though. Back in his first few weeks in office in 2015 co-sponsored Arizona’s HR 1445 a law meant to conceal the name of whatever police officer should kill a suspect in the line of duty from the public for at least 90 days. Now that law in and of itself seems pretty fascist and extreme given the wide swath of police killings in the past few years. But it’s not the bill that stirred up controversy. It was the fact that Kern lied during debate on the bill and claimed to be a “certified peace officer”. Shocker the media did some checking and could not find a record of Kern being a police officer let alone having any sort of certification to be one. So… yeah we think speaking at what amounted to a hate rally and helping to work the crowd into frothing madness is enough alone to get Anthony Kern a profile here. There’s also the fact that he chose to give Donald Trump a tongue bath a few months after getting on our radar celebrating Trump’s executive order to reverse every executive order Barack Obama made to combat climate change and whining about how the coal industry had “suffered” which is an odd choice of energy to support in a state that’s famous for getting SUN all the time y’know?   And over the past three years Anthony Kern’s voting record has shown us he’s definitely the sort of Arizona Republican worthy of a CSGOPOTD profile: Now we have kind of a big update on Anthony Kern as in 2019 he sponsored legislation that would allow law enforcement to have their name removed from “The Brady List” which is a database of law enforcement officials kept who are suspected of repeated dishonesty. Now while we’ve already established that Kern a former peace officer seems to like the idea of Arizona being a fascist state where the police can do whatever they want and that he’s a liar… lo and behold it turned out he had a selfish reason for wanting to have names taken off the Brady list… HE’S ON IT. Not only did Kern sexually harass a co-worker back in 2010 he once lied to law enforcement officials that he had already worked to pay them back for a department laptop he “lost”. Now he was trying to revise history so that none of that would ever be reported on… In December of 2019 he faced calls to be stripped of his leadership of committees in the legislature for making homophobic statements and referring to sex education as “pornography”:             ”Do you want LGBTQ Rights to take over? You want your kids being taught sex education — that you pull up a computer right now —I can pull up you know Pornhub.com … I could pull it up and show you anything on that porn site is what is going to be taught to your kids your little kindergartners.”       The controversies were apparently enough to see Anthony Kern bounced out of office in 2020 by about 2000 votes. His road to returning to office might even be more difficult than that as he is currently the subject of investigation by the FBI because he was present at the U.S. Capitol on 1/6/21 for Trump supporters’ violent coup attempt. At this time Kern has not cooperated with public records requests to release his text messages in the build-up to the attack which are considered the public record as long as they still serve as legislators (and he still did at the time). At this time we would like to wish this fascist our finest “good riddance” salutes and hold out some glimmer of hope that if he was a participant on 1/6 he’ll be carted off to jail.       One Year Ago April 25th 2020: Anthony Kern (AZ)… 2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago April 25th 2019: Anthony Kern (AZ)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago April 25th 2018: Anthony Kern (AZ)… Original ProfileFour Years Ago April 25th 2017: Frank Guinta (NH)… 2017 UpdateFive Years Ago.
