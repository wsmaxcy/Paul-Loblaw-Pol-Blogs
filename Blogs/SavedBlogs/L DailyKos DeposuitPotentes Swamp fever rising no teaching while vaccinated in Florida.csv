L, Swamp fever rising: no teaching while vaccinated in Florida, DeposuitPotentes, 2021-04-27, Remember those old Onion stories — headlines along the lines of “Florida man eaten while trying to clean pet alligator’s teeth?” As the whole state sinks into the social swamp vigorously flooded by Governor Rot “Criminalize statistics not graft” DeMentis — Lake Okeechobee is now high ground — the paroxysms of the death of satire have shaken those stories loose and tossed them over to our news media of record. “Miami school bars vaccinated teachers from seeing students” for example appears above the fold in BBC’s News of the World today. Co-founder [of the cleverly named Centner Academy] Leila Centner informed parents on Monday that… "We cannot allow recently vaccinated people to be near our students until more information is known..." Headlines mislead you may be thinking. Perhaps this school worries about a known risk like teachers who are asymptomatic because they’re vaccinated passing a covid-19 variant to students? Umm no. Mrs Centner also repeated a false claim of vaccinated individuals affecting unvaccinated people saying three women in the school's community had their menstrual cycles "impacted after having spent time with a vaccinated person." Unwilling to let go of the hope that one day funny stories about Florida will appear in satirical journals rather than the BBC again you may be inclined to believe we’re missing context with this one. Perhaps the school’s a small off-the-radar several-student charitable effort — free to parents in need. Umm no. The Centner Academy a fee-paying school is located in Miami's Design District. Annual tuition begins at $15160 (£10898) for pre-school students and goes up to nearly $30000 for middle school students who are around 13-15 years old. Ambitious Floridians — feeling the power center of the Great Orange Swamp in their midst — seem to be in a race to the bottom. Arrest your epidemiologists in a pandemic? Check. Hand your vaccination contract to Publix — a supermarket chain so expensive that it just bought a site one block from the beach in Fort Lauderdale — in exchange for a $100000 on-the-record campaign contribution? Check. A flood of green radioactive glop quivering to spill into Tampa Bay? Check. But wait there’s room for other Players. Accuse the Justice Department of investigating your own sex trafficking in a denouement we’ll eventually call GaetzGate? Check. Just make it so outrageous it gets on Fox. Let Fox launder it. Write a book in prison. Run for higher office. If the Florida GOP is now fully dedicated to blowing US social institutions off their foundations ambitious Floridian politicians had better not be subtle about their depravity. But this story deserves a special place. We might file it under “Wrecking education.” It goes a step further however than undermining educational institutions that turn out too many Democrats. This Florida man and woman are embedding depravity in the curriculum.
