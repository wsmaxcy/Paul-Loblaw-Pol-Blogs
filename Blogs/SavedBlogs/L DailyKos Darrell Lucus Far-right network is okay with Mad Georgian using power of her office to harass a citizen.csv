L, Far-right network is okay with Mad Georgian using power of her office to harass a citizen, Darrell Lucus, 2021-07-07, Just before we went home for the Fourth of July 37 House Democrats led by Rep. Pramila Jaypal of Washington penned a letter to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy demanding that he “take immediate action” to rein in easily the most odious member of Congress Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.  Read the letter here. The letter whose signatories include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Cori Bush Marie Newman Ilhan Omar Gerry Connolly Brendan Boyle John Larson and Dina Titus highlights a number of incidents which show the Mad Georgian has acted in a way that “does not comport with what we expect from a member of the House of Representatives.” But they missed at least one incident that proves not just beyond reasonable doubt but beyond all doubt that it’s time for Greene to be expelled—yesterday. Among other things Jayapal’s letter highlights how Greene sparked a confrontation with Bush in March when—horrors!—Bush asked Greene to put on a mask. It also notes how Greene put a transphobic sign in front of her office to taunt Newman for daring to stand up for her trans daughter and harassed AOC even when she wasn’t willing to engage with her. The final straw came at a MAGA rally in late June in which the Mad Georgian called AOC “a little Communist” and called for her to be locked up.  The letter was sent out on July 1. But two days earlier an incident took place that shows a mere talking-to doesn’t even begin to suffice. On June 29 Greene appeared on Steve Bannon’s War Room which airs on far-right news network Real America’s Voice every weekday morning. While pitching a fit over the National Children’s Museum including anti-racism messages on their website Greene had the gall to urge viewers to call the private cell phone number of the museum’s director. No this isn’t snark folks. Raw Story got a clip. Greene bragged that Bannon has trained his audience on how to act and urged them to “do your job.” And Bannon not only let her read that number but actually applauded her. I had to listen to this twice to believe it. A member of the House of Representatives effectively used the power of her office to call for a private citizen to be harassed. Granted we already knew Greene was a problem. After all she had no qualms about harassing and threatening Democratic lawmakers even when she knew they were going to be her colleagues. But doxing and harassing a private citizen is another thing altogether. It gets even more outrageous than that. You’ll notice that Raw Story had the decency to mute Greene when she was reading that cell number. But if you look at the War Room video archive at the Real America’s Voice website the original video is still there unmuted. Click over to page five of the archive and then look for the second part of Greene’s segment with Bannon. The doxing begins at the 11:15 mark. You’ll have to take my word for it—for obvious reasons I’m not linking to it. Granted Bannon has no qualms about making terroristic death threats against public officials. And Real America’s Voice has shown it has no qualms about letting him do it. But again you would think that attacking a private citizen would be too much even for this bunch of deplorables. Apparently not. After this there is no doubt. Marjorie Taylor Greene must be expelled and soon. Call and email your congressperson and demand that this woman be expelled.  Moreover this is more evidence that Real America’s Voice must be driven off the air. As I mentioned earlier it relies almost entirely on Dish Network and streaming platforms for its viewership. Get a hold of Dish as well as streaming platforms PlutoTV Roku Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Plus I noticed that GoDaddy hosts the Real America’s Voice domain while it appears that Amazon Web Services hosts the website; report it for an egregious terms of service violation. Any network that thinks this is at all okay has no place in our national conversation. Period.
