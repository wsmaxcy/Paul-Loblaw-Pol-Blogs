C, Biden to Abolish ICE protesters in GA - "Give me 5 days" , Karen Townsend, 2021-04-30, Joe and Jill Biden traveled to Georgia yesterday to celebrate the 100-day mark for his administration. Of all the fifty states he could have chosen to brag about surviving 100 days in office he chose Georgia. Georgia in case you haven’t noticed is Biden’s new favorite state. You may think that is an odd thing to say given how Georgia has been a reliably red state since the 90s but the Democrats have made inroads into moving Georgia back into the blue state column. Thanks to the efforts of Stacey Abrams and her supporters along with national Democrats the state has two Democrat senators. Governor Kemp is up for reelection in 2022. Abrams will likely challenge him again – she still has not conceded to his victory in 2018. Joe Biden held a drive-in rally in Duluth Georgia Thursday. Jill introduced him to the audience. As he began to speak a group of protesters began chanting “End detention now!” and “Abolish ICE”. They also held up a large orange banner that read “communities not cages.” The sign was held up for the crowd to see away from Biden so he couldn’t read it. Biden was caught off-guard and stopped his speech to listen to them. Then he told the protesters he agrees with them – “Give me another five days.”  “I agree with you. I’m working on it man. Give me another five days” Biden told them. “Folks y’all know what they’re talking about. There should be no private prisons period. None period. That’s what they’re talking about. And private detention centers. They should not exist. And we are working to close all of them.” It isn’t news that Joe Biden is against private detention centers for illegal migrants. He said so on the campaign trail and now it sounds as though he is working on doing away with them. In his first week in office Biden signed an executive order directing the DOJ to not renew contracts with privately operated “criminal detention facilities” but those are separate from detention centers used for migrants. His random plea to the protesters to give him five more days begs the question – what is happening in five days? What is the Biden administration doing to change up how illegal migrants are detained? Maybe it was just the response from a startled old man that some supporters turned on him and protested at his event. After all some of them shouted that they voted for him. One protester continued to shout that ‘our families are dying.’ ‘We voted for you too’ a protester said. ‘I promise you’ the president pledged. Remember that the reason there are privately run detention facilities for illegal migrants in the first place is because of the flood of migrants at the southern border. Privately run shelters go up when demand for beds overtakes available government-run facilities. Even private charities are asked to help shelter the overflow. In order to close privately-run facilities now Biden has to find places to take the migrants which he is having difficulty doing. During the Trump administration when it successfully got the border back under control some private facilities were able to close as they were no longer needed. That isn’t the case now. In his speech he also trashed the state for its new election integrity legislation signed into law. He continues to rant about Jim Crow 2.0 when that has been proven to be a trope. Georgia’s election laws are more generous than his home state of Delaware. It is not normal behavior for the president to target one state as Biden continues to slam Georgia and support boycotts of the state. By the way why was Biden holding a rally in Georgia when he supported the MLB boycott? The president wishes economic harm on a state to own the Republican leadership in that state. The White House says that about 315 cars were at the drive-in rally. Drive-in rallies were used by Biden during the presidential campaign when COVID-19 restrictions curtailed normal campaign rallies. Just three days ago Biden held a press conference to say that face masks are no longer needed during outdoor activities. He wore a mask to walk to the podium though to show how silly this has all gotten. Biden removed his mask to deliver his speech. Jill however kept hers on even though she was on the stage with her husband and not in a crowd of people. Both Bidens are fully vaccinated. There is no reason for them to wear masks outdoors. It is political theatre and virtue-signaling. Joe Biden had a bit of a panic attack when his speech was finished and he went to put his mask back on. He couldn’t find it. There is a very awkward search for it with Jill coming forward to help. Biden is joined on stage by Georgia’s new Democrat senators also wearing masks outdoors while fully vaccinated. This video needs Veep credits…  Biden spends 30+ seconds on stage looking for his mask only for it to be in his pocket… "I'm looking for my mask. I'm in trouble." pic.twitter.com/eOjm3VZ4iN — Nathan Brand (@NathanBrandWA) April 29 2021  How pathetic is that? It’s just embarrassing. Also why does Biden keep saying he’ll be in trouble? He made the same claim when he stopped to take a question from a reporter a couple of days ago. Why is the leader of the free world “in trouble” over anything as small as answering one more question from a reporter or misplacing a mask? He’s the big boss. It sounds as though his handlers have cowed him into submission of their orders. No questions. Wear a mask everywhere. It’s ridiculous and makes Biden look weak which is the last thing he needs. President Harris runs a tight ship.
