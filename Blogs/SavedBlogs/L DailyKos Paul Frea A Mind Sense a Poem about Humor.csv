L, A Mind Sense a Poem about Humor, Paul Frea, 2021-06-28, Here is a poem dedicated to the cartoonists on Daily Kos who make me laugh and think…  One of the most underrated traits For survival Is the sense of humor And the associated laughter  And the feeling of happiness provoked I am glad mammals invented it.  I've seen cats smile with their eyes And dogs laugh with their tails Not to mention their hyena cousins Who laugh out loud.  Dolphins are playful Monkeys do mischievous tricks And elephants are well known For their jokes.  I have never witnessed a snake Or any other reptile laugh But perhaps herpetologists have overheard Snakes making private jokes About the size of their rattles Or who makes the funniest  Slithering sounds.  It is my contention The real downfall of the dinosaurs Was unrelenting depression Over their darkened situation --  One falling rock joke Might have saved their scaly hides.  Gallows humor helps humans Get through gross events There is the rookie cop who grimaces and says “What an ugly wound to the face.” When the Medical Examiner pipes up “He was shot in the stomach.”  Doctors nurses soldiers firemen All appreciate the wit in the room Or on the team  That lets them escape For a moment The dreadful moments.  Perhaps no group of specific peoples Have had to fine tune Their sense of humor More so than the Jews/Hebrews.  Back in ancient Egyptian times During the building of the pyramids One can almost hear one Hebrew Say to another “Yes the work is hard very hard “We work non-stop sunrise to sunset “On the other hand We do get time off “For the beatings.”  Or a more recent moment There was this Jewish man Who after being rounded up by the Nazis Just before dinner And placed on a train to the camps Could not shake the nagging feeling He had left the oven on...  No matter how bad life is Individually or for a whole society A tiny smile A bit of laughter A twist of words Or a well planned joke Does brighten the day Can break the tension And create common ground.  If you can laugh with your enemy Friendship is possible.  So God bless Comedians and cartoonists Let's double their salaries!                                    Carl Scott Harker ©2021 _________________________________________________________ My latest book of poetry —  poems written between late April to Late October 2020 can be found on Amazon here:  Above Us Only Sky.
