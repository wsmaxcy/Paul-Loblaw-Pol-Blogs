L, Campbell House: An overview (photo diary), OjibwaforMuseums, 2021-06-30, The Campbell House in Spokane Washington operates as a house museum interpreting life at the turn of the 20th century. The house was designed by well-known Spokane architect Kirtland K. Cutter for Amasa B. Campbell (1845-1912) and his wife Grace Fox Campbell (1859-1924). The house is a picturesque English Tudor Revival exterior of stucco sandstone brick and heavy timbers. Amasa Campbell originally came to Idaho in 1887 and invested in the Gem Mine. Following labor unrests in Idaho Campbell moved to Spokane and had their home built in the Browneâ€™s Addition. After Grace Campbell died in 1924 her daughter Helen (Mrs. W. W. Powell) gave the house to the Eastern Washington State Historical Society in memory of her mother. Campbell House then became a community museum with historical and art exhibits. A new museum building was completed on the east lawn in 1960. There was a formal restoration project from 1984 to 2001 to return the house to its former elegance.
