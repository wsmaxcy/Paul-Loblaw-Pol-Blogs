L, Liveblog I:  Verdict - Chauvin Murder Trial, gchaucer2forCommunity Live Bloggers, 2021-04-20, Community Live Bloggers thank everyone for their support of this series! Today we receive the verdict.  I have nothing else. Update WaPo: "A verdict has been reached and will be read between 3:30-4:00 p.m. CT  Tuesday April 20" (4:30-5:00 p.m. ET) according to the notice. Among the live feeds on YouTube: Washington Post coverage (goes live at 4 pm ET.)   Instructions to the jury (WaPo — not sure if it’s paywalled.) Also Washington Post: The charges are second-degree unintentional murder third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Second-degree unintentional murder is the most serious charge brought against the former Minneapolis police officer. For a conviction jurors must conclude that prosecutors showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death while kneeling on him for more than nine minutes last May. Since Chauvin has no previous criminal record the second-degree unintentional murder charge carries a presumptive prison sentence of 12.5 years according to Minnesota sentencing guidelines. If he had a criminal past Chauvin would have been looking at a maximum sentence of 40 years. For the third-degree murder charge the state attempted to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death “by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind without regard for human life.” Cahill initially dismissed the charge but the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that the judge was wrong to do so. He reinstated the charge last month.  Liveblog updates on the present trial session are found in the comment thread. Many thanks to the erudite commenters who add so much value to the discussion!

Today a jury did the right thing. But true justice requires much more. Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied. pic.twitter.com/mihZQHqACV  Mega thanks to belinda ridgewood for posting this diary in an extremely timely manner.  Many thanks to all who bore witness to the proceedings no matter how much time you could commit.  It is important that people understand the process in order to understand the verdict.
