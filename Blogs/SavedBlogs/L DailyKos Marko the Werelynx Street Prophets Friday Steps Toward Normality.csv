L, Street Prophets Friday: Steps Toward Normality, Marko the Werelynx, 2021-04-23, Greetings and welcome to another little bit of fluff from the clippings of another self-inflicted haircut. Or rather welcome to another little community open thread with your somewhat less-fuzzy host Marko the Werelynx. Join me below for the usual refreshments and photos from my week. Once again Mrs the Werelynx and I made our escape to a special little place in the foothills. Mostly a lazy weekend but we did manage one long walk. Things are a few weeks behind seasonally up there.     Of course we made our way back to the big city and the usual things.   This was a week of tests— medical tests. The joy of growing older includes the regular collection of samples. Next week the results. Went for another walk Thursday evening with friends from the neighborhood.  Thanks for stopping by. This is an open thread.
