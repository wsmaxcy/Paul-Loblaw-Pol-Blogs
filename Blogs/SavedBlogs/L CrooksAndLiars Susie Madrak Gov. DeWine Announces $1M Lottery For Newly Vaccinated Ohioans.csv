L, Gov. DeWine Announces $1M Lottery For Newly Vaccinated Ohioans, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-13, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is offering vaccination incentives ‚Äî including a $1 million prize and college scholarships ‚Äî in a final effort to get more people vaccinated before the state‚Äôs mask mandate ends June 2 he announced yesterday. While all of Ohio‚Äôs orders except those applying to nursing homes and similar care facilities end stores and businesses can still require customers to be masked. As of May 26 any newly vaccinated adult who has received at least one dose may enter a lottery that will provide a $1 million prize each Wednesday for five weeks. But the real prize should get parents motivated to get the kids motivated: five full four-year scholarships to an Ohio public university ‚Äî including tuition room-and-board and books ‚Äî to vaccinated residents under 18. The money comes from existing federal pandemic funds DeWine said and the Ohio Lottery will conduct the drawings. I know that some may say ‚ÄúDeWine you‚Äôre crazy!  This million-dollar drawing idea of yours is a waste of money.‚Äù  But truly the real waste at this point in the pandemic -- when the vaccine is readily available to anyone who wants it -- is a life lost to COVID-19. ‚Äî Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) May 12 2021 Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has created five lottery drawings for any adult who is vaccinated. This will finally motivate people who are more interested in a tiny chance of becoming rich than a much bigger chance of remaining alive. ‚Äî JRehling (@JRehling) May 13 2021 Knowing the demographic that is dragging their feet on the #COVID vaccine ‚Äî this idea is actually kind of genius. https://t.co/tgU0Qo5ojp ‚Äî Dean Wallace üó≥üóΩ (@deanofdublin) May 12 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
