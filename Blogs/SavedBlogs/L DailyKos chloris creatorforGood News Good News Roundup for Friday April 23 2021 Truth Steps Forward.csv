L, Good News Roundup for Friday April 23 2021: Truth Steps Forward, chloris creatorforGood News, 2021-04-23,  Many are writing about the meaning of the Chauvin verdict with respect to improvements (or not) for people of color especially in the justice system. Others with more insight than a blonde white woman can write about that. It was also a moment when truth stepped forward. And not just truth but agreed-upon truth with 12 diverse jurors from a swing state agreeing upon three separate verdicts in about 10 hours. They regarded the evidence and they believed their eyes.  And although “believe your eyes” is where you’d think we would all start consider all the times in recent years when we have not seen reasonable verdicts when people have refused to believe their eyes and mountains of evidence. There are the many times when truth lost out after murders were perpetrated by the police by Zimmerman and more. Lies also won out in other cases. The senate refused to convict tRump after two impeachments even though he tried to engineer foreign interference in the first and in the second he sent his thugs to murder the vice president and to attack the very people sitting in judgment on him. These were both cases where there should have been no question especially the latter and yet we did not get sufficient agreement on the truth.  Truth has been taking a beating for years. Now we know some people tell lies for power and profit; they know they are not telling the truth. Rupert Murdoch got the vaccination as soon as he could. So did the tRumps. They are simply evil and many of their followers are likewise evil. But there are those who truly believe the lies they have been told. People who while dying from COVID-19 still claim it does not exist. People who are ready to murder their own children because they believe in conspiracy theories. And yet in Minneapolis we got a verdict the just truth-based verdict actually three just truth-based verdicts. The jurors were not politicians (as far as I know). They were ordinary citizens. They came to unanimous agreement that is 100% in a time when Biden’s victory of 51.3% over the former guy’s 46.9% is considering resounding. But maybe the fact that they were not politicians is reason for hope. Maybe we the people can lead the politicians back to truth and to justice. Or maybe when reasonable people are sequestered and are presented the truth they will acknowledge it instead of being swayed by alternative facts lies. Come in to Gnusville dear friends and see what we the people are doing. And please add your own news and the good stories of others! The Biden team is really really busy and I know I did not catch everything. CDC count of vaccinations for 9AM Thursday April 22: Distributed 282183915; In arms 218947643. Regular Scheduled Programming No one here is naïve; we are aware of the many who are fighting to destroy our country. Some of us expected it: the cheating the lying the chaos and yes even the attempts to cling to power despite the clear will of the people. But we are here to read the efforts and the positive results of those (including us and our fellow gnus) who are working so hard to save our country from those very bad people.  We are furious with them for what they are doing and we are letting them know.  Remember: 💚  There are more of us than there are of them. 💛 They are terrified when we organize.  THERE IS LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE TERRIFIED! 💔 They want us to be demoralized. We have to keep demoralizing them. Name blame and shame!  IT IS WORKING! WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE DEMORALIZED! 💙 The best way to keep up your spirits is to fight. So take the time to recharge your batteries but find ways to contribute to the well-being of our country and our world. Biden Harris and their administration have been hard at work. Here are the last week’s posts at the White House briefing room. DOJ investigating Minneapolis police department Katie Benner New York Times  The Justice Department will investigate the policies and operations of the Minneapolis Police Department Attorney General Merrick B. Garland announced on Wednesday a day after the former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder in the death of George Floyd in a rare rebuke of police violence. “The Justice Department has opened a civil investigation to determine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing” Mr. Garland said in brief remarks at the Justice Department. Such investigations are often the precursors to court-approved deals between the Justice Department and local governments that create and enforce a road map for training and operational changes. We have to remember that despite Chauvin’s being convicted this week and several in the MPD coming forward to testify against him three other police officers stood by and helped while Chauvin murdered Floyd. We have to remember that the original statement the MPD about Floyd’s death was “sorry a guy died of a medical incident at a hospital” nature. So the MPD needs some serious investgating. 🎩 hpg The Department of Transportation is appointing a chief science officer the first time in more than 40 years the role will be filled in the department. https://t.co/ZNnVZr7SSv  The Republicans’ base is shrinking Jennifer Rubin Washington Post The first comes from TargetSmart a Democratic data firm that has compiled information on more than 98 percent of those who cast ballots last year from individual voter files. The firm finds: “Non-college educated whites dropped from 53.8% of the electorate in 2016 to 49.2% in 2020.” Moreover “Nationally total turnout increased by 12% relative to 2016 turnout among [Asian American and Pacific Islander] voters surged by 43% and Latino turnout increased by almost a third of all votes cast.” (While the disgraced former president may have done better among Hispanics in some states than he did in 2016 overall he still lost 65 percent of these voters.) TargetSmart’s chief executive Tom Bonier told me this means that non-college-educated Whites increased turnout over 2016 but just not as fast as other groups. In other words the GOP is “running out” of non-college-educated Whites. ✂️  The second statistic behind the Republicans’ collective panic attack has to do with their solid core of supporters: White evangelical Christians. As I pointed out last month Gallup finds that the percentage of those attending any religious institution has dropped below 50 percent the first time in 80 years of its surveys. 🍑 Georgia Republican AG resigns from Republican Attorneys General group Tierney Sneed Talking Points Memo Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr (R) resigned from his position as chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association the Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported Thursday as the organization has faced scrutiny for promoting the Jan. 6 rally that led to the insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. Carr in an April 16 resignation letter obtained by AJC cited a “significant difference of opinion” among the organization’s leadership with the “fundamental” difference beginning after Jan. 6 and the “opposite views” about the “significance” of the events of that day. He also referenced “resistance by some” to the decision of the group’s executive director Adam Piper to resign in the fallout from the controversy over RAGA’s connection to the riot. The day before the Jan. 6 mob RAGA’s fundraising arm the Rule of Law Defense Fund sent robocalls urging recipients to “march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal.” Murkowski breaks ranks: Just caught Lisa Murkowski's floor speech on why she sided with Democrats and helped narrowly confirm Vanita Gupta as asst AG.Alaska tribes had a lot of sway in her decision.Murkowski is looking out for Alaska Native women facing horrific levels of domestic violence. This means VP Harris did not to come over to the Senate floor to cast a vote. It also means that McConnell who had said there would be no R votes for Gupta (this is what Maddow said on the Wednesday night show) was wrong. It also means Murkowski cares for something more than just the RW agenda. And that is bad news for the Rs. Gaetz in damage-control matter Roger Sollenberger The Daily Beast The report also suggests that Gaetz has few friends in Washington. While Gaetz swore off donations from corporate PACs he kept the door open to donations from candidate committees. But he has so far reported no financial support in 2021 from friends in Congress such as Jim Jordan and Stephen Scalise both of whom donated to his 2020 campaign. And while he made same-day $4000 donations to Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) in mid-February Gaetz did not give money to any House colleagues. ✂️  Gaetz has also continued to rack up legal fees a pattern established last summer around the time the DOJ investigation was reportedly launched. The Daily Beast reported earlier this month that weeks after Greenberg was first indicted—in June 2020—Gaetz paid the law firm Venable LLP $38000 nearly four times the combined amount of legal fees incurred in the previous five years. The new filing reveals a $21000 payment to Venable in February bringing total legal expenses up to $85000 since Greenberg was charged. One pundit thinks the R election fraud claims may backfire Brian Klass Washington Post A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month contained an ominous indicator of the  state of U.S. democracy. According to the poll 60 percent of Republican voters still believe the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump — and 55 percent of Republicans think the 2020 election was rife with voter fraud and other forms of election-rigging. ✂️ These authoritarian machinations are a serious threat to American democracy. But what Republican leaders may not realize is that their lies about the quality of U.S. elections pose a serious threat to their political chances in the 2022 midterms too. Republicans seem not to care about the violent consequences of spreading lies about election fraud or torching faith in democratic institutions. But they might care once they understand that spreading baseless Trumpian conspiracy theories about voter fraud isn’t just immoral and authoritarian. It’s also politically idiotic. ✂️ In Georgia’s 2021 special election a preview of this phenomenon already played out after Trump spread lies about his election defeat. Two unhinged Trump acolytes Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood called for a boycott. Some in Georgia’s Republican party have blamed that attempted boycott for the party’s ensuing razor-thin losses which handed control of the U.S. Senate to Democrats. Imagine that replicated in all 50 states. This electoral risk for Republicans is compounded because they’re already going to lose plenty of voters who went to the polls in 2020 to vote for Trump rather than to vote for Republicans more generally. Those low-propensity voters are even more likely to stay home than more devoted Republican supporters if they falsely believe their votes don’t matter. Stacey Abrams knows what she’s talking about Republican Senator John Kennedy asks @StaceyAbrams to give him a list of provisions in Georgia’s new voter suppression law that she objects to. It’s a long list. Give it a listen: pic.twitter.com/9R57K0HPfN Representative Val Demings also knows what she is talking about Rep. Val Demings shut down Jim Jordan pic.twitter.com/LDwY9eHC3P Virginia governor legalizes MJ possession starting 7/1 Axios Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Wednesday signed a bill that legalizes the possession and growth of small amounts of recreational marijuana starting this summer. Why it matters: Virginia is the first Southern state to legalize recreational marijuana and the 16th state in the country to do so. Details: Under the law effective July 1 adults 21 and older can possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana. What he's saying: “This is the latest step we are taking to building a more equitable and just Virginia” Northam said before the signing the bill. “Reforming our criminal justice system to make it more fair.” World leaders pledge cooperation on climate despite other rifts Ellen Knickmeyer Matthew Daly and Christina Larson AP News WASHINGTON (AP) — The leaders of Russia and China put aside their raw-worded disputes with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday long enough to pledge international cooperation on cutting climate-wrecking coal and petroleum emissions in a livestreamed summit showcasing America’s return to the fight against global warming. Neither Vladimir Putin nor Xi Jinping immediately followed the United States and some of its developed allies in making specific new pledges to reduce damaging fossil fuel pollution during the first day of the two-day U.S.-hosted summit. But climate advocates hoped the high-profile — if glitch-ridden — virtual gathering would kickstart new action by major polluters paving the way for a November U.N. meeting in Glasgow critical to drastically slowing climate change over the coming decade. ✂️  Biden’s new U.S. commitment timed to the summit would cut America’s fossil fuel emissions as much as 52% by 2030. It comes after four years of international withdrawal from the issue under President Donald Trump who mocked the science of climate change and pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. 🎩 hpg Breaking: The Senate has just passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act 94-1.The one vote against was Republican Josh Hawley. 🌻 Agricultural bill with good provisions for climate has bipartisan backing Ximema Bustillo and Helena Bottemiller Evich Politico A bipartisan bill aimed at bolstering agricultural carbon markets has garnered enough Republican support to have a good chance of passage in the Senate. It's a positive sign for the industry’s pivot to be part of the solution on climate as the Biden administration seeks sweeping action on the issue. Senate Agriculture Chair Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) reintroduced on Tuesday a revamped version of their Growing Climate Solutions Act. The proposal has 17 Republicans on board — more than enough to meet the 60 vote threshold for cloture. Boozman the ranking member of the committee had previously expressed skepticism about the bill but now backs the effort.  Russia’s threats towards Ukraine have not been talked about much at Daily Kos but is really really important. It’s in the unity section because it would not have happened if Biden hadn’t strengthened our ties with our allies in NATO. Russia is pulling back troops from Crimea & Ukrainian border. Putin folded like an accordion when news broke that the US is considering sending missiles to Ukraine. The price he’d pay suddenly became way too high. He’s highlighting his inferiority w/ these moves.  Biden knows it.  Voting rights. This may be the biggest issue threatening our democracy right now. Besides contacting your representatives at the state and federal level to do the right thing (depending on who they are) you can support and contact these organizations: ACLU — American Civil Liberties Union Democracy Docket — founded by Marc Elias so important in fighting the challenges after the last election. Fair Fight — founded by Stacey Abrams 🌱Grass roots. Biden and Harris can do the top-down stuff but we have to support from the bottom. I don’t know how to deprogram 75 million people but some things have been written about such as deep canvassing and lots of people are talking about this. If you know someone (who did not storm the Capitol) then see if you can be pleasant. Instead of trying to reason with them (logic is obviously not their strong point) distract them with something else. We need to remove the sources of lies and to take down the temperature. If we get more of the Rs to wear masks and to get vaccinated and to vote for Ds the country will be a better place. We need to coax some of them out of the rabbit holes and diffuse the anger and the crazy. 🏃 Run for something. If you want to run for something but have no idea what to do these people will help you. They also like money and volunteers to help those people who are running so even if you’re not in a position to stand for office you can help. Note: they are especially planning to target the 57 Rs in local governments who participated in the insurrection.  👎 Defund the seditionists. This is a list with companies that sometimes have donated to the seditionists and their current approach to supporting or not supporting the seditionists. The list is long. You will recognize many of the corporations and you probably have a relationship with some — either you are a customer a shareholder or maybe even an employee. Contact them and compliment or complain but let them know you are watching. Forward it to others.  Chauvin is in solitary confinement Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Tim Arango New York Times Derek Chauvin is being held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day in Minnesota’s only maximum-security prison after he was convicted of murdering George Floyd and led out of a courtroom in handcuffs according to authorities. ✂️  Mr. Chauvin who is being held as he waits to be sentenced will be alone in his cell for all but one hour each day during which he is allowed to exercise. Even then he will be kept away from all other prisoners and remain under the watch of prison guards inside the unit. ✂️  The cells are small and contain nothing more than a bench with a mattress pad a combination toilet and sink and a tiny shower. Prisoners are allowed to bring in necessities like clothing toothpaste and soap as well as a pen and paper. In some cases they may also receive books magazines or newspapers but only if prison officials approve. This week I want to honor all of those who participated in what resulted in the conviction of Derek Chauvin. President Biden speaks about these people: Let’s also be clear that such a verdict is also much too rare.  For so many people it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors: a brave young woman with a smartphone camera; a crowd that was traumatized — traumatized witnesses; a murder that lasts almost 10 minutes in broad daylight for ultimately the whole world to see; officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks which should be commended; a jury who heard the evidence carried out their civic duty in the midst of an extraordinary moment under extraordinary pressure.️ I also think all those who have gone out and demonstrated in support of Black Lives Matter deserve to be honored because they helped create an atmosphere in which truth could prevail. ⚡️  President Biden expected to recognize the Turkish genocide of the Armenians The Guardian ⚡️  Something like a hundred years late because the US has always need Turkey more than Armenia. This is from a story at the Good News Network where a restaurant owner offers a thief the chance to change his life. The robber has not yet appeared but I hope this approach gets used by others.  COVID-19 hospitalizations down among seniors Matthew Perrone and Carla K. Johnson AP News WASHINGTON (AP) — COVID-19 hospitalizations among older Americans have plunged more than 70% since the start of the year and deaths among them appear to have tumbled as well dramatic evidence the vaccination campaign is working. Now the trick is to get more of the nation’s younger people to roll up their sleeves. The drop-off in severe cases among Americans 65 and older is especially encouraging because senior citizens have accounted for about 8 out of 10 deaths from the virus since it hit the U.S. where the toll stands at about 570000 I found a series of articles about being greener in the kitchen at the Washington Post Using peels and stems in cooking Rachael Jackson Washington Post  The leafy bits. Carrot greens radish greens beet greens the leaves tucked into your bunch of celery. If they’re fresh and crisp drop them into salad. If they’re wilting think stir fry. If they’re a bit tough dice and saute them or spin them into pesto. But do use the greens atop carrots turnips and the like quickly — the leaves fade fast and the root veggies below last longer without their leafy tops.  Pickle juice. Mix with some oil and herbs and voila: salad dressing. Class it up with vodka and vermouth for a martini; or tequila bitters simple syrup and lime juice for a margarita. You might even chug it after a workout. Some athletes swear by the hydrating cramp-fighting power of pickle juice. For your latest pandemic baking challenge Google “pickle juice bread” and brine up a loaf. Seeds. Just as you roast pumpkin seeds consider roasting the slippery kernels from their melon and winter squash cousins. Food52 suggests soaking watermelon seeds in salty water followed by 20 minutes in a 320-degree oven. Note you can roast leafy bits as well. Husband and I enjoy roasted cauliflower leaves although it’s important to separate the leaf stem (which needs to cook longer) from the leafy bit which only needs a few minutes. Reducing plastic wrap Kari Sonde Washington Post Once ubiquitous these days plastic wrap has product alternatives. With increased consumer concerns about the environment a quick Internet search will lead you to new products such as stretchy washable silicone bowl covers; popular beeswax-coated cloth from companies like Beeswrap or Abeego; mixing bowls with matching lids; a dishwasher-safe microwave cover to stop the splatter; even brand new Compostic wrap a plastic wrap alternative that claims to decompose in 12 to 24 weeks without leaving toxins behind. Writer Kristen Hartke wrote a guide for The Washington Post in 2018 about even more products that can help you avoid plastic wrap foil and paper towels.  You may not even need a new product. Look around your kitchen for items you may already have such as compostable parchment paper and think about making small tweaks to your kitchen practices whether that means setting a plate on a bowl before microwaving its contents or transferring leftovers to a lidded container. Enzyme-compostable plastic Science Daily  Despite our efforts to sort and recycle less than 9% of plastic gets recycled in the U.S. and most ends up in landfill or the environment. Biodegradable plastic bags and containers could help but if they're not properly sorted they can contaminate otherwise recyclable #1 and #2 plastics. What's worse most biodegradable plastics take months to break down and when they finally do they form microplastics -- tiny bits of plastic that can end up in oceans and animals' bodies -- including our own. Now as reported in the journal Nature scientists at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley have designed an enzyme-activated compostable plastic that could diminish microplastics pollution and holds great promise for plastics upcycling. The material can be broken down to its building blocks -- small individual molecules called monomers -- and then reformed into a new compostable plastic product. 🐦 I do a lot of other writing.
