L, Indonesian Submarine Crew Beautifully Passionately Sings 'Farewell'. Soon After.... All Are Lost., Tevye , 2021-05-01,  Surrounded in darkness and tight quarters being a submariner often feels lonely and suffocating.  And the crewmen must rely on each other.... physically emotionally mentally....and the bonds they forge are iron clad. They are a tight family. Indonesian submarine KRI Nanggala 402 had one such crew. They were together for over two years….many quite longer. First petty officer Setyo Wawan was amongst them. Two years ago whilst being interviewed he had this to say about his life aboard “Sometimes we cannot even sleep. And sometimes when we do sleep we have to do it in a sitting position because of the limited space. We keep on bumping into each other … but over time we become brothers. In fact we become very close … a family.” Two weeks ago over half of the 53 men that make up the crew gathered together in the main cabin to sing some songs and share some stories. One mentioned that they should sing a song for their loved ones back home. The song is a recent Indonesian hit entitled Sampai Jumpa ...whose title means Goodbye.  Farewell. Their commander Heri Oktavian is amongst those gathered around a seaman strumming an acoustic guitar. Hey until we meet again another day In order for us to meet again I am willing to let you go Even though I am not ready to miss you Even though I am not ready to be without you I hope for the best for you   The 40 year-old German-built submarine which was recently extensively refitted disappeared early Wednesday whilst it was performing and testing systems in a live torpedo training exercise off Bali. After the military lost contact it sent a distress signal to the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office and asked for assistance in finding the missing vessel. It sparked an International effort to find the crew before the oxygen systems ran out three days supply which included efforts by Australia Malaysia India Singapore and the United States. It had been hoped that the submarine's hull would be intact and the crew could be rescued.  And then items were found floating on the waters surface….which included prayer mats. The sub was indeed found. At 2700 feet. Split into three pieces.   All the crews children will be given aid and educationally supported until they receive their bachelors degrees. The government has pledged and promised to retrieve the bodies of the crew no matter the depth no matter the hurdles.   ‘I WANT TO SEE PAPA FOR THE LAST TIME’ Munawir’s eldest daughter Aura Aulia has moved hundreds of thousands of Twitter users with her heart felt expressions of pride of her patriotic father – and her grief at his death. She posted a photo of her father with the caption “So proud to be your little girl” on her Twitter handle @siughtheeambiss. “It’s not possible my Papa will surely return my Papa will come home please tell me the ship could still be found” she tweeted last Saturday a day before an emotional Indonesian military chief Hadi Tjahjanto told a press conference all crew members were presumed dead. “I want to see my Papa for the last time” she tweeted that same day. Thousands tweeted back messages of condolences and comfort to the grieving teenager. “You are his daughter. His blood flows through yours. He will never leave you alone. No parent ever leaves his child alone … He will continue to be in your heart” tweeted one.   Musical group Endank Soekamti who wrote the song posted on Instagram "If land is not where you are destined to return to there is a place for you in heaven."    Last night since i first heard them sing….i was haunted by the song. And thought about their last moments… and their last thoughts... alive. I woke early around 5:00am picked up my guitar...and learned the cords and sang the song. And lit a candle for these brave handsome young men and their families. I know that with you i’m far from alone. And it’s imperative that we share grief together along with joy.  With and for our shared humanity.
