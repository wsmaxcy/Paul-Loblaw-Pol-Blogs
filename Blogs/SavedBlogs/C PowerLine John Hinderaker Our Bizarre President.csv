C, Our Bizarre President, John Hinderaker, 2021-06-24, Earlier today Joe Biden bragged about the “money” he is sending out to various constituencies. As Paul notes the wheel is still in spin on these spending bills. But for the moment a different question: does anyone seriously believe that Joe Biden is in possession of his faculties or is remotely capable of discharging his duties as president? I doubt it: Poor fella thinks he’s in a library again. Call Jill! pic.twitter.com/qgbrViIizm — Chris Stigall (@ChrisStigall) June 24 2021  
It is actually rather entertaining to watch the Democratic Party press pretend that we have a functioning president. The entertainment value will be gone of course the first time there is a crisis. And no president has ever gotten through a term in office without a crisis.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
