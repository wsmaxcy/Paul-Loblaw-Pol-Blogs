L, IAN: Tuesday June 29 2021: Historic 1940 Diego Rivera Fresco on the Move!, ejoannaforItzl Alert Network, 2021-06-28, Tuesday:  A day to: appreciate frescoes and murals.      Monday: Crimson Quillfeather Tuesday: ejoanna Wednesday: Pam from Calif Thursday: art ah zen Friday: FloridaSNMOM Saturday: FloridaSNDad Sunday: loggersbrat A recent NYTimes article on an historic Diego Rivera (1887-1957) fresco caught my eye. “Pan American Unity” was moved  across San Francisco!  And somehow that’s good news.  Because around the Bay Area recently when an old mural or fresco comes up in the news it’s usually been about attempts to um cancel (usually that means destroy or cover up) the art work. And Rivera and his works were no strangers to controversy during his life and after. I mean the man was a a Commie!! (See his Rockefeller Center NYC fight.) But in this case the move was from San Francisco City College. . . . . . to a more secure location while City College completes a new campus building. (In the past the work wasn’t that accessible since viewing hours at the college were limited.) Eventually the fresco will be returned to the new City College site I presume where viewing hours will be more generous---I also presume.  Its new location in the interim is the SF Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA.) It will be on (free public) display there until 2023.        And yes this renewed artist was also married to another renowned artist Frida Kahlo. Amazing couple.
