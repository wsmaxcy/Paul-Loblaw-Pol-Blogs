WI-Sen: EMILY's List has endorsed state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski in the Democratic primary to take on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson next year (though Johnson still has yet to say whether he'll seek re-election). Godlewski is the most prominent woman running in a field that includes Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry state Sen. Chris Larson and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson and could yet grow further still. AZ-Gov: Democratic state Rep. Aaron Lieberman who flipped a Republican-held seat in the Phoenix area during the 2018 blue wave has announced a bid for governor. Lieberman however faces a difficult path to the nomination in a primary headlined by a far more prominent Democrat Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Speaking of his state House victory he said "To win in District 28—just like winning in the state—you have to show people you're not a partisan fighter" which may be a winning message in a general election but is likely going to be less appealing to many primary voters. CA-Gov: Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill passed by fellow Democrats in the state legislature that will allow the pending gubernatorial recall election to take place earlier than forecast by letting lawmakers waive a 30-day period to review the costs of the election. The state Department of Finance has until Aug. 5 to complete its own financial review after which Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis will have 60 to 80 days to schedule the recall assuming legislators choose to waive their audit under the new law. AZ-Gov AZ-AG: Meanwhile Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton who'd been mentioned as a possible candidate for either governor or attorney general has reportedly told House colleagues that he won't seek statewide office. However there's no direct quote from Stanton confirming his plans including whether he intends to seek re-election. TX-06: Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw who is one of the more prominent members of Texas' congressional delegation has endorsed state Rep. Jake Ellzey in the all-GOP special election runoff on July 27. Crenshaw said he felt motivated to back Ellzey due to the "dishonest" campaign being run by conservative activist Susan Wright who has the endorsement of Donald Trump. New York City NY Mayor: New York City's Board of Election released its first set of ranked-choice tabulations for last week's primary on Tuesday showing Eric Adams' wide 29-20 lead in first-preference votes over Maya Wiley collapsing to a narrow 51-49 edge over Kathryn Garcia in the 11th and final round. However—and this is a very big "however"—not a single absentee ballot has yet been counted and none will be included in any tallies before next week. Those absentees could prove decisive: As of Monday (the penultimate day for ballots to be received) almost 125000 mail-in ballots had been received with the largest share—32%—coming from Manhattan Garcia's best borough with early and Election Day voters. (By contrast 28% of in-person votes were cast in Manhattan.) They could also completely reshape the last round of the race because at the end of the 10th round Garcia led Wiley by just 3806 votes meaning that Wiley could very well end up as one of the two finalists. Patience will be necessary as election officials have previously said they would not have a "more complete" count of absentee ballots until the week of July 12—and there's no word at all as to when we'll have a final tally. They've also said that RCV tabulations will only be performed once a week on Tuesdays. Restraint however nowhere to be found when it comes to Adams who immediately issued a Trump-esque statement arguing that the fact that additional votes have been counted since election night somehow "rais[es] serious questions" and claiming that there have been unspecified "other irregularities." Adams offered no details or evidence to support his assertions. Woof: We are aware there is a discrepancy in the unofficial RCV round by round elimination report. We are working with our RCV technical staff to identify where the discrepancy occurred. We ask the public elected officials and candidates to have patience.  Boston MA Mayor: Suffolk University is out with a new survey of Boston’s all-Democratic mayoral primary on behalf of The Boston Globe. The poll shows City Councilor Michelle Wu in first place with 23% and acting Mayor Kim Janey close behind at 22% while City Councilors Annissa Essaibi George and Andrea Campbell trail with 14% and 11% respectively. This result matches prior polling that has shown Wu and Janey trading narrow leads for the first spot (though one late May poll showed Essaibi George leading Wu 22-18).  All candidates will compete on one ballot in a preliminary round on Sept. 14 and the two-top vote getters will advance to the general election on Nov. 2 regardless of whether anyone takes a majority of the vote.
