L, The Inoculation Project 7/4/2021: Circuits and Books, belinda ridgewoodforThe Inoculation Project, 2021-07-04, This week weâ€™re helping a Georgia elementary school teacher who needsÂ materials to teach aboutÂ electricity and an Oklahoma high school teacher who needs copies of a Ta-Nehisi Coates book for her class.Â We hope that readers who support quality public school education will help by sharing or supporting our featured projects. The Inoculation Project is an ongoing volunteer effort to crowdfund science and math projects for red-state public schools in low-income neighborhoods.Â As always our conduit isÂ DonorsChooseÂ a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporationÂ that facilitates tax-deductible donations to specific vetted projects in public schools. ðŸŽ† ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ¦… ðŸŽ‡ Last week nomandates started us onÂ thisÂ never-before-funded teacherâ€™s project to bringÂ her GeorgiaÂ elementary school classroom a circuit-kit starter set and a salinity meter and we made good progress! Resources:Â Â Help me give my students to explore STEM grade-level standards-based experiences in several content areas. Economic need:Â Â Nearly all students from lowâ€‘income households Location:Â Tara Elementary School Morrow Georgia Total:Â  $264.19 Still Needed:Â Â $145.66Â Â $30.66 Teacherâ€™s Comments from Ms. Staples: My Students:Â My school is equipped with highly inspiring educators who build a culture of the love of learning and instill that our students can be truly successful and great. In my classroom I provide learning experiences and opportunities that inspire my scholars to lead learn grow academically and persevere. Many of my students learn new aspects of our world that they have not been previously exposed to. My students love to learn and aspire to pursue their dreams. Also according to the U.S. Census 17% of the members of this community have received a bachelor's degree. We need your help to help afford our scholars opportunities to broaden their scope innovative learning experiences and to become prepared to become college and career ready. Our mission is to provide a globally competitive education that empowers students to achieve academic and personal goals and to become college and career ready productive responsible citizens. Thank you in advance for helping our scholars with the necessary educational supplies to facilitate quality activities that will catapult our scholars to be able to reach their true and highest potential. My Project:Â Â These tools will help students have hands-on interactive activities in science concepts related to electricity and more powered by STEM. My students thrive with hands-on activities in a small group setting. My scholars will gain a great understanding of their grade level concepts involving electricity physical and chemical changes and more. Students will build and test various types of circuits explore mixtures containing salt and the engineering design process in STEM with the Lego Build Kit. We will beam with excitement as they apply skills that they have learned in lessons. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!  This Oklahoma City high school (full name: Classen School of Advanced Studies) is a public magnet school that offersÂ both an International BaccalaureateÂ program and aÂ Visual and Performing Arts program. I imagine many readers will join me in agreeing with Mrs. Barmann that the book sheâ€™s requesting would benefit her students of any background. Resources:Â Â Help me give my students diverse new texts to read. Between the World and Me is book that will get kids thinking and see the world from a more diverse perspective. Economic need:Â Â Nearly all students from lowâ€‘income households Location:Â Â Classen SAS High School at Northeast Oklahoma City Oklahoma Total:Â Â $611.54 Still Needed:Â Â $324.05Â Â $214.05 Teacherâ€™s Comments from Mrs. Barmann: My Students:Â Â I teach at an inner city college preparatory and performing arts school. My students are high achieving global minded citizens. They are open to new experience and are engaged in their course work. They are driven by a will to succeed. They love learning and come from a variety of backgrounds. They are deeply committed to their education and to each other. They are part of the International Baccalaureate program. This means they take the most rigorous course available. They spend a great deal of time studying different texts and different cultures. My Project:Â  As a literacy teacher I am continually looking for engaging texts. Between the World and Me novel will get kids talking and seeing current issues in a new way. This text intertwines nonfiction with a literary approach and is important in our understanding of different perspectives. The personal and frank perspective of Coates will help the students see the challenges of being Black in America. My students prefer to have hard copies of books and hopefully this book will be used for several years. Students will be reading in class and at home. We write and discuss what we read always connecting texts to global issues for greater understanding. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference! A 2015 interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates author ofÂ Between the World and Me.    Last week our long-term project was completed! Many thanks to our readers for both donating and increasing our/the projectâ€™s visibility. Mrs. Hudson-Kennedy wanted to create a science center in her Alabama kindergarten classroom. Now sheâ€™ll have the group of age appropriate science materials and kits she requested thanks to the project Science in Kindergarten. She writes:Â ThanksÂ so much for your generous donations. I have always wanted a Science Center in my classroom now my budding scientists will have the resources and materials they need to conduct detailed experiments observe nature and investigate life cycles. I appreciate the support from so many donors who helped to make my classroom dream a reality.  Back in 2017 Mrs. T. wanted her Detroit preschool class to be able to have fun and interact with friends while they learned to think plan and design. She found two big building sets with ramps and tracks that marbles and gears can roll along one that sits on the floor and one that sticks to a magnetic board. Because who doesn't like to release something at the top and watch it roll all the way down? The project was Pioneer Engineers. (More photos at the link.)  There are no words that can express my sincere gratitude for your generous donations! The impact upon my students has been incredible. For example the children have increased their vocabulary using STEM terms. One student said "You have to turn the RAMP down so the GEARS can go faster." The children are learning to take turns with the Engineer A Coaster Kit and with the Create-A Chain-Reaction Kit they are learning to collaborate. When the children first saw the materials their eyes lit up as they exclaimed "Ya look at the new toys!" I introduced the toys during large group and the children could not wait to get their hands on the materials. The entire class of 18 worked with the materials for at least 30 minutes! My next steps are to increase the complexity of play by introducing other parts of the Chain Reaction kit and different ramps with the Engineer A Coaster. I will also encourage the use of the skill building cards in both STEM kit that was provided and different sized balls and other objects to test. But most of all I plan for my students to have fun learning about Science Technology Engineering and Math!  Founded in 2009Â The Inoculation ProjectÂ combats the anti-science push in conservative America by funding science and math projects in red-state classrooms and libraries. Our conduit isÂ DonorsChoose a crowdfunding charity founded in 2000 and highly rated by bothÂ Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau. Every Sunday we focus on helping to fund science or math projects preferably in neighborhood publicÂ schools where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income households.Â We welcome everyone who supports public school education â€” no money is required! Finally hereâ€™s our list of successfully funded projects â€” our series total is 906! The success-list diary also contains links and additional information about DonorsChoose. I know some of our friends in drought-stricken places arenâ€™t able to see fireworks locally so it seemed as if we ought to have some here. This New York City show is from 2017 â€” itâ€™s put on annually by Macyâ€™s department store on barges that extend for over a mile along the East River. Happy 4th to all our TIP community!
