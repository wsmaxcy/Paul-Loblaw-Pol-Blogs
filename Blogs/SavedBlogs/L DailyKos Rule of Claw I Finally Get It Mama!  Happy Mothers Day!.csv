L, I Finally Get It Mama!  Happy Mother's Day!, Rule of Claw, 2021-05-09, 1976 was an interesting year.  Very.  The music was changing with disco quickly taking over the scene.  We elected a brilliant man from Georgia the New York Yankees were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series and a generation of hippies were morphing into a generation of yuppies. Liberalism was bleeding out however.  Our economy not more than two decades earlier the envy of the world was rapidly losing pace what with burgeoning globalism and undisciplined leadership.  From 1976 on everything would change and for many get harder. Jobs would get harder to find and keep.  Getting your first apartment went from meeting the landlord and making a good impression to nearly needing a background acceptable for Quantico. Drinking would escalate drug use would proliferate and it did not scream “Good time to have your first kid!” So it was a scared 17 year-old girl was pregnant.  This was a big kid.  This kid liked to kick. This kid’s birth would mark the end of her youth. Sometimes this kid was a sweetheart like the time he painted a mug for her in art class.  Sometimes this kid was a pain like the time he used the walls of the house for a canvas and lipstick for the paint. Mostly he never got it. He never got why a drunk driver shattered her pelvis and nearly killed her and in fact nearly him and his entire family but doomed her to an early lack of mobility. He never got why she seemed so tired at age 25. He never got why she never felt comfortable.  Why she was always nervous. He never got how she could wake up at 3 in the morning to make donuts yet still be awake making dinner later that night.  He never understood how the flour made her hands so dry he never got why she was always yawning. He never got why she seemed so sad. His Dad left the family saying nary a word to the kid but “It’s time for me to go.” One day the kid began to get an inkling of how it all fit.  Somewhere around the age of nine he began to understand that his Dad left them with nothing that she had not gone to college that jobs were scarce and she had a child to feed. Oh and this kid loved to eat.  Burgers especially although he was always trying to sneak ice cream. He never got her sadness looking at other parents husbands and wives still together happy and prosperous. He never got her going from a young woman to a classy middle aged woman to a woman who can barely move.   But still classy. He never saw her age.  It just happened one day. One day he was visiting.  The kid now grown and married watched as she struggled to remove a pizza from the oven.  He watched as she writhed in pain hearing her bones creak.  It was then he saw more creases in her face though she was still youthful.  It was then the gray streaks appeared in her hair though he could swear it was just yesterday she was a sunny blonde with porcelain skin and his friend’s dads lined up outside of school to flirt with her.  Not all of them single either! And he never got why none of them dated her.  And why she sought none of them. He never got how much it hurt her to be abandoned by her husband.  How jaded she became. He never got how having his little brother drained her health or how little support she truly had. Or how fast she had truly grown up. Then one day he got it completely.  He got all of this plus more.  He got that the very hardest job in the world is being a Mom.  He got how much she gave up for him.  Her youth.  Her vibrance.  Her dreams.  A strange guilt descended upon this kid like a feeling he had to pay off. He had to be something he had to be worth it it could not be no that this woman would give up so much of herself without the kid she gave it up for being someone.  But there he went again somehow making it about himself.  Maybe this is what kids do he thought.  But he had not been a kid for some time. Finally he realized that being a mom is not about an investment paying off it is about unconditional love.  It is about independence and strength and what she wants most is for the kid to be a good son.  A good man.  A good husband to his lovely wife. The kid had always been worth it.  This was the point.  This is what being a mom is.  It is about love. And as the kid prepares to visit on this Mother’s Day as he checks his own creases and grays his gait and his voice for age he thinks back to 1976 and a scared girl carrying a bowling ball sized kid and wonders what she thought the future held. What did she hope for?  What was she looking forward to?  What would she hope the year 2021 would bring? Probably a lot.  Maybe new technologies and a career.  Maybe she would see her child in the movies or TV.   But most of all she would have hoped for me.  Yes me if you had not already guessed.  She would have hoped I could be there.  You see for the first time since January 2020 with the family fully vaccinated I can give her a hug.  That is all a mom wants in the end.  She just wants some approximation of the love she gave you reciprocated.  You can’t match it no matter how hard you try.   You can’t replace it you can’t recreate it you can’t copy it.  You just have to enjoy it while you have it. You have to appreciate it. You have to cherish it. Only then will you finally understand will you finally get it. And you will then look up and for the first time see those wrinkles those gray streaks those sacrifices for you manifested in achy joints and fine lines.  And just when you feel that twinge of sadness that guilt she will smile and give you that hug. And she will probably make breakfast.  Even today. Happy Mother’s Day Mom!
