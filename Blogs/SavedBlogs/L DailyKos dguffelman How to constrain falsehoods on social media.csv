L, How to constrain falsehoods on social media, dguffelman, 2021-05-05, Trump’s ban from Facebook is upheld.  www.washingtonpost.com/… This is like the old sexist joke about mixed emotions:  watching your nasty in-law driving off a cliff in your new car.  While it’s certainly great not having to see the Orange Menace on social media the somewhat arbitrary standards for banning content is troubling as noted by the leaders of France and Germany and even by Russian dissident Navalny.   I’ve wrestled with what an appropriate standard must be.  Clearly inciting violent overthrow of the government must always be banned.  But that’s not enough IMO.  Thoughts?
