Prior to his current role as a professor of oceanography at Oregon State University Spinrad served as NOAA's top scientist under President Obama and the U.S. representative to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. The nomination comes at a difficult moment in NOAA's history. The agency has been without an official Senate-confirmed leader since former President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 after his two nominees to lead the agency failed to garner enough support to win a full vote before the Senate. If Spinrad manages to win over the Senate he will have to contend with a challenge beyond the agency's already-rigorous scientific mandate: restoring public confidence in a traditionally apolitical agency marred by political scandal. Al Jazeera Fire extinguished on oil tanker off Syria after suspected attack  Firefighters have extinguished a fire on an oil tanker off Syria’s Banias refinery after a suspected attack by a drone coming from the direction of Lebanese waters.

L A Times Judicial overreach? Some say judge went too far in ordering L.A. to clear skid row The city and county of Los Angeles may have a strong case as they seek to overturn a sweeping federal judicial order requiring them to offer shelter to everyone on skid row legal analysts who have followed the case say. The city and county have asked for the order to be stayed until the appeal is heard by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A stay would freeze the order from U.S. District Judge David O. Carter including the requirement that the city put $1 billion in escrow to pay for the clearance until the appeal was decided. At the heart of Carter’s injunction is the argument that a long history of state-sponsored racism in Los Angeles has driven Black people into homelessness. Legally the argument rests on the question of whether there’s a “state-created danger” and whether government inaction has put more people at risk. The injunction was necessary Carter wrote because the city and county failed to fix the problem “despite numerous opportunities and resources to do so.”
