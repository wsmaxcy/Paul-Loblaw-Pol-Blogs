L, Roku Goes Fascist with Fox, marketgeek, 2021-05-02, Hi all haven’t been here in some time just wanted to note that the Roku Channel on my streaming device is now hyping Tucker Carlson and Fox Nation. I sent email to their PR folks about supporting a fascist racist but I doubt that will have any effect.  I had no idea that Roku was racist and fascist but there you go they are now publishers of anti-democracy pro-facist propaganda aimed at supporting white supremacy. Roku is normalizing hate propaganda and lies. How can we convince Roku not to give these rotten ****s a platform? This is just awful. Are there places to go to publicize this and shame Roku into a takedown? Advertisers to bother so that Roku will take notice? How can we make this go-for-the-nazibucks decision by Roku especially painful?
