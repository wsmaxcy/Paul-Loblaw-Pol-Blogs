L, NY Post Reporter "Resigns" After Reporting False Story About VP Kamala Harris., Merlin196357, 2021-04-28, A New York Post reporter by the name of Laura Italiano has resigned from her job after being “forced to write” a false story about Vice President Kamala Harris. The Kamala Harris story -- an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard enough against -- was my breaking point. And the false story she was forced to write?   The New York Post has edited and republished a false story by one of its longtime reporters who claimed that copies of  a 2019 chidlren’s book written by the vice president were being included in “welcome kits” given to migrant children at a shelter in Long Beach California.  The implication was that taxpayers were paying for that book to be part of the welcome kits.  Naturally this was already picked up by the usual suspects: But the assertions in Italiano’s initial article published Friday claiming that the book was being shelled out at migrant shelters had already circulated through a well-oiled machine of false information. By the time the Post issued a single-sentence editor’s note at the bottom of the original online article weakly acknowledging on Tuesday it had erred the original story from four days before had already been pounced on by Republicans who further spread the false information to thousands more in their base.  Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AL) on Sunday suggested that tax dollars were being used to pay for Harris’ book to be distributed to immigrants. “The Biden administration’s weakness caused a surge of illegal immigration” Cotton mused that afternoon. “Now they’re forcing taxpayers to buy Kamala Harris’s book to give to those illegal immigrants?”  And the RNC jumped on this false outrage bandwagon too.  And this went on for DAYS before there was that “single-sentence editor’s note” about this report being an “error.”  This the same MO as the false claim about the Biden Administration’s banning meat as part of the Green New Deal proposal.  That lie went on for days until a one sentence “oops” was read on Fox TV in under 30 seconds. This is going to be the SOP for Murdoch operations under Biden.  Lie your ass off for days then put out that you made an “error” under your breath.  If Biden and his team want to fight back I would be making a list of Murdoch lies and repeating them back to reporters as proof that Fox and the NY Post are  disinformation outlets. The only other thing to note is that Laura Italiano didn’t resign BEFORE she wrote the lie about VP Harris.  If she had any real character Italiano would have done that before signing her name to a report she knew was a lie.  It definitely shows that Murdoch employees should NEVER be given the benefit of doubt by colleagues at other news outlets.
