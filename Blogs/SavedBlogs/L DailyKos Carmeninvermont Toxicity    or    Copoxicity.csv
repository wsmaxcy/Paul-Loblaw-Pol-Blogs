L, Toxicity    or    Copoxicity, Carmeninvermont, 2021-04-27, Toxicity defined according to Oxford is “the quality of being very harmful or unpleasant in a pervasive or insidious way.” There are other ways to add to the definition but it seems to me that we need a new word for police who make others suffer from their disease.  In Colorado we have this: “Colorado officers who violently arrested 73-year-old with dementia laughed about incident afterward video shows The officers fractured Karen Garner’s arm and dislocated her shoulder according to federal lawsuit”  Trigger alert. I have looked at the laughing cops in the station video and the body cam arrest of the scary 73-year-old dementia patient videos both. They are not pleasant.  https://www.denverpost.com/2021/04/26/karen-garner-booking-video-loveland-police/  The general story is that Karen Garner walked out of a local Walmart after not paying  $13.00.  The merchandise was rescued but the employees still felt that cops needed to  be called. In the “arrest” body cam video it is clear to any ethical person that Karen Garner is not a threat but is clearly intellectually challenged. The video of the laughing cops in the station laughing while Karen Garner is close by and NOT getting treated for injury clearly demonstrates ETHICALLY CHALLENGED cops.    I see no silver linings to this storm of clouds across the country.  It is not even at the point of “First they came…” Is it that we are at the point of needing to ask the UN for help? Maybe some Blue Helmets could protect all of us from some of us.  Stay Safe
