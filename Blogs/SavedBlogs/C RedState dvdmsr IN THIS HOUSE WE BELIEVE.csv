C, IN THIS HOUSE WE BELIEVE:, dvdmsr, 2020-12-24, Unfortunately not every thought can be condensed into cute little slogans to be conveniently displayed on a placard. IN THIS HOUSE WE BELIEVE: All lives matter black blue red yellow and white. The right of unborn human beings are human rights too. When a person chooses to do something illegal he’s not “criminal” but he is “a criminal.” Similarly if an alien does something illegal like violate immigration law he’s not “illegal” but he is “an illegal” as in an illegal alien. If science is real then sex is real binary and like race immutable and unborn human beings exist and are alive from the moment of their conception so saith the biologists. God is real. Like love logic and gravity God is seen and experienced most clearly through His effects. God is love. When one obeys God one loves and not necessarily the other way around. The problem is that all too often we mistake our lust for love. Moreover doing something with someone we love does not make what we’re doing right (see adultery). Lots of us do very self-serving and destructive things in the name of love that doesn’t make what we do love nor does it make us loving. Disobeying God is always wrong no matter that we may “love” doing it. Obedience to God is everything that is true love and kindness. We all fall short and are in need of forgiveness. Thankfully though if we repent and believe in Jesus Christ we shall be (saved) forgiven.
