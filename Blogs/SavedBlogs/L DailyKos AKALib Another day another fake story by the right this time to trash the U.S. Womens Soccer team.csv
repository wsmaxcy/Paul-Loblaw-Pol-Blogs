L, Another day another fake story by the right this time to trash the U.S. Women's Soccer team, AKALib, 2021-07-06, Right-wing media is doing some synchronized bleating and hate-mongering this morning accusing members of the U.S. National Women's Soccer Team of "turning their backs on 98-year old World War II veteran Pete DuPré" as he "played the National Anthem on his harmonica" at UConn's Rentschler Field in East Hartford Connecticut where the team beat Mexico 4-0. There is no truth to the accusation — all team members were standing in respect during the time. Some were facing towards Pete DuPré while others were facing away from him but they were facing the American flag which is actually the correct way to face when the national anthem is playing. Some of those facing the flag clearly had their hands on their hearts others bowed their heads in respect. Many in the stands did the same. But the GOP base needs some fresh red meat 24 hours a day and these right-wing media critters get paid to dish out this hateful propaganda. This "controversy" about the US Women's National Team was entirely fabricated by right-wing figures. Some of the players turned to face the flag during the anthem (it's located at one end of the stadium) while others looked forward like the veteran who was performing it.

The U.S. Soccer team issued these tweets to explain the truth - To be clear no one turned their back on WWII Veteran Pete DuPré during tonight's anthem. Some USWNT players were simply looking at the flag on a pole in one end of the stadium. The players all love Pete thanked him individually after the game and signed a ball for him.  This is respect. Each and every player waited for their opportunity to come up to Pete post-game before getting on the bus said hello thanked him and signed his ball. https://t.co/0fhtkTSxIF ... while news organizations tried to set the record straight - No some USWNT players didn’t turn their backs during the national anthem on Monday. They were facing the flag at the end of the stadium. Just like what also happened Thursday without anyone noticing and attempting to concoct a lie for outrage retweets.https://t.co/NqxkWJhqPG Did the right-wingers issue any corrections? Of course not it’s more lies by the purveyors of propaganda and more left-blaming by Fox and an implicit boast that their round-the-clock lies are working. Right-wing media now justifying their false claims against the US women's soccer team because "a huge percentage of American sports fans totally think it’s believable" and it's "unfortunately a sign of where we are" that "so many of us just presume that level of disrespect." pic.twitter.com/Q0s0RLkTj6 This is what propaganda looks like — keep fabricating and repeating lies since the intended audience is too uninformed and gullible to understand for the truth. There must be a central committee of republican propaganda that works round the clock ginning up fake stories to generate mass hysteria to sow division and to foment hate towards certain groups. Unfortunately this psychologically affects people outside the hard-core GOP base too. So we need to keep fighting back and exposing their lies and their insidious attempts to turn this country in a racist fascist fiefdom Let’s not let these lies go unanswered. Let’s keep informing as many people as we can about what the principle-less fascist republican party is doing to our country. What else do you suggest?
