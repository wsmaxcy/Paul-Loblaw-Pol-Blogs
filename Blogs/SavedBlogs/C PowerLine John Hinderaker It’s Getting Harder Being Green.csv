C, It’s Getting Harder Being Green, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-22, The truth is it is harder being normal. The forces of authoritarianism have come for of all things the Muppets. I did not speak out because I wasn’t a Muppet… But seriously: Disney has gone stark raving mad: Anyone who streams “The Muppet Show” on Disney+ will see a disclaimer first — warning of “offensive content.”
***
The disclaimer shown prior to each episode warns viewers that the show features “stereotypes” and “mistreatment of people or cultures.” “This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now” the disclaimer states. “Rather than remove this content we want to acknowledge its harmful impact learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together” the disclaimer says. Good God. The Muppets are what anti-pig? Who knows? But Disney which weirdly has been taken over by far-left snowflakes doesn’t limit its disapproval to puppets: The warning will also appear before some iconic movies including “Aristocats” “Dumbo” “Peter Pan” and “Swiss Family Robinson.” Peter Pan is discriminatory toward the hook-handed? Or maybe toward Princess Spring-Summer-Fall-Winter who was a positive role model if I ever saw one? Whatever. And what about Dumbo? I have absolutely no idea. Madness is abroad in the land and companies like Disney and many others have caught the contagion. What I want to know is when will Disney disavow its products like Johnny Tremain the story of a boy in revolutionary Boston or Davy Crockett like Johnny T. the subject of a late 50s or early 60s craze featuring coonskin caps? I am not sure we can even describe the headwear these days without running afoul of the far-left speech police. And of course Davy died at the Alamo that shrine to white supremacy. Or something. The culture war is far more advanced than the normal person realizes. We conservatives need to sound the alarm and try to awaken our normal fellow citizens before it is too late much like Paul Revere who I suppose has been canceled too. What is the appropriate formula? One if by land and two if by sea? One if by Twitter and two if by Facebook? Something like that. STEVE adds: This is getting personal. The head writer for the Muppets Jerry Juhl was our next door neighbor when I was a teenager.  He used to have martinis with my dad on a frequent basis and when my parents were away he’d sometimes come over and ask me to turn my stereo down when he was trying to write. Which was totally reasonable. This was the 1970s man and I didn’t have earphones yet! So yeah this makes me mad. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
