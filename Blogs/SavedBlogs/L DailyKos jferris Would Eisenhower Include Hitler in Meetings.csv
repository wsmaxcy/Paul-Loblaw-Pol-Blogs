L, Would Eisenhower Include Hitler in Meetings?, jferris, 2021-06-29, The headline says it all. The Democrats are diluting their power by allowing Repugs to participate in meetings. This is an existential moment in our country’s history. We cannot collaborate with the opposition. Can you picture Douglas MacArthur reading Tojo in on our Pacific strategy during World War II? World War II was an existential moment in our history. Existential moments call for implacable opposition to our foes. Mitch McConnell is implacable in his opposition to us. We will not cannot win this battle with a bipartisan strategy. Bipartisanship will not win the 2022 elections. Compromise will not appease our foes as they follow a scorched earth strategy. Respecting our foes makes us look weak. Sharing our strategies with our foes will not bring us victory. It’s past time to wage an all-out battle to defend our Democracy. Nothing less will succeed. Nothing less is acceptable.
