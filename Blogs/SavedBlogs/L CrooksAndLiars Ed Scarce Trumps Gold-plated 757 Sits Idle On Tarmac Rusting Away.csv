L, Trump's Gold-plated 757 Sits Idle On Tarmac Rusting Away, Ed Scarce, 2021-03-20, Experts are said to be "baffled" why the plane is being left on the tarmac exposed to the elements and in decay. Source: CNN Trump's personal Boeing 757 was always the crown jewel of his wealth -- the ultimate sign that he had made it. He's used it as a backdrop for sleek photo shoots campaign rallies VIP tours for shots of him eating his Big Macs and KFC plated with a knife and fork. Trump loved to show it off -- the customized cream-colored leather seats gilded bathrooms the seat buckles layered in 24-karat gold. But today it sits idle on an airport ramp in Orange County New York about 60 miles north of Manhattan. One engine is missing parts. The other is shrink-wrapped in plastic. The cost to fix and get it flyable could reach well into the high six-figures a price-tag Trump doesn't appear to be dealing with right now. Though the current state of his finances aren't public the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the hospitality industry home to so many of his businesses. Flight records accessed by CNN show the 757 hasn't been flown at all since Inauguration Day when Trump's use of Air Force One ended leaving him to less showy modes of transport. Once a symbol of his wealth and prestige Donald Trump's 757 is now idle in disrepair for months left on a ramp in a random New York state airport. https://t.co/qTI1BhS2e9 â€” Kate Bennett (@KateBennett_DC) March 19 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
