L, "...Not anti-beef but rather pro planet.", sugarmagnolia, 2021-04-29, I was watching the local news last night and they had a brief segment on Epicurious. Since 1995 Epicurious has been a source of recipes and tips for people who like to cook. Although the magazine is no longer in print the digital site is still popular with over 19 million users and almost 10000 recipes. First lady Michelle Obama partnered with Epicurious in the summer of 2010 with “Chefs Move to Schools”. It was an endeavor to teach school students and staff across the nation about healthy eating habits. A few days ago Epicurious announced they would no longer feature recipes that include beef. They aren’t taking down old recipes but felt that continuing to feature beef wasn’t consistent with their vision of trying to cook more sustainable meals. They acknowledge that cutting out beef is a first step to sustainable cooking/eating. As most of you know (from many good diaries here and copious other research) cows are way less efficient than beans. The climate emergency our planet is facing led them to their decision that they would no longer give air time to one of the world’s worst climate offenders. Neither Biden or Epicurious are trying to take your meat away from you but clearly someone wants us to think about what we eat.
