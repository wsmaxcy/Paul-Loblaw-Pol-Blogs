C, Squaring the illegals circle cont’d, Scott Johnson, 2021-03-04, Following on my observation that the Biden administration’s official welcome mat for illegal aliens cannot be squared with basic public health admonitions the New York Post reports: More than 100 illegal immigrants who tested positive for the coronavirus — after their arrival in Texas ​​since late January — have been released by the Border Patrol into the Lone Star State ​and are free to travel to other parts of the US according to reports. Felipe Romero a spokesman for the border city of Brownsville told Fox News that they are telling the migrants who tested positive to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to quarantine and maintain social distance but that Brownsville doesn’t have the authority to stop them from traveling to the rest of the country. He said the 108 positives account for 6.3 percent of the total migrants who received rapid tests at the city’s main bus terminal a program that began on Jan. 25. Some of the migrants described to Noticias Telemundo Investiga ​how they were tested at the border and then allowed to hit the streets despite a positive result for the coronavirus. ​​ Miriam Izaguirre a migrant from Honduras said she crossed the Rio Grande on Monday with her young son and surrendered to authorities but was released within a few hours by the Border Patrol.  “Right now we were tested for COVID and they separated us … because we were positive” Izaguirre told news site. “We are waiting right now.” ​They expect to board a bus to Houston. ​​ Other migrants who tested positive said they plan to travel to North Carolina Maryland and New Jersey.

They were simply informed that they had.​ Others said after the test they were directed to another waiting area than the others but their movements were not restricted. ​ A Border Patrol spokesperson told the newspaper that migrants receive an initial inspection for symptoms but that only people with suspected cases are sent to local health authorities for “proper testing diagnosis and treatment.” Whole thing here. Yesterday the gentleman from Madame Tussauds castigated the governors relieving citizens of insane mask mandates as victims of “Neanderthal thinking.” Yet on their face Biden’s policies are stupid beyond our understanding of Neanderthal man. Neanderthal man at least had the unconstrained instinct for self-preservation going for him. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
