C, A 'Social Justice' Prosecutor in Los Angeles; What Could Possibly Go Wrong?, Dana Pico, 2020-12-08, Law enforcement in Philadelphia has gone to [insert slang term for feces here] since Larry Krasner has become District Attorney: When he was running for district attorney Larry Krasner supported by a PAC funded by George Soros made his commitment to social reform and reducing the inmate population quite clear. He promised to fundamentally transform the city’s criminal justice system. No one can accuse Krasner of not following through. As the Inquirer reported on June 23rd (2019) Krasner is funneling an increased number of gun cases to a court diversionary program called Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD). In 2018 Krasner’s first year as district attorney 78 cases were sent to the ARD program compared with 12 the previous year. Why does this matter? Because criminals who carry guns usually intend to use them. Maalik Jackson-Wallace for example was given a second chance by Krasner’s office. Jackson-Wallace whose case was highlighted by the Inquirer was initially arrested on a gun possession charge. The case was sent to ARD and Jackson-Wallace received probation. He was arrested a second time for gun possession and released on unsecured bail. On June 13th he was arrested again and charged with murder; police say he shot and killed a 26-year-old man. (Jackson-Wallace’s attorney claims it was in self-defense.) When Krasner was practicing law in Philadelphia – specializing in criminal defense and civil rights cases – he sued the police department some 75 times. He doesn’t believe in the death penalty and he’s called law enforcement “systemically racist.” Well George Soros put big money into another district attorney race helping George Gascón win the office in Los Angeles County. Mr Soror poured $2250000 into Mr Gascón’s coffers. And now Los Angeles County will have the same problems which helped send Philadelphia’s homicide rate to record levels. By CBSLA Staff | December 7 2020 | 2:07 PM PST LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – The county’s lead prosecutor announced sweeping changes Monday for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office including the elimination of cash bail for misdemeanor and some felony offenses. Newly sworn-in George Gascon announced Monday that county prosecutors will no longer seek cash bail for any misdemeanor or non-violent non-serious felony offenses. Attorneys who have clients behind bars awaiting trial on any of the affected offenses can immediately schedule a hearing to revisit bail and his office won’t contest their release. Gascon 66 also told reporters he is taking the death penalty “off the table” and will seek to re-sentence inmates on death row to life in prison. The former San Francisco prosecutor also declared he won’t file any gang enhancements in criminal complaints saying they undermine rehabilitation exacerbate racial inequities and unnecessarily crowd jails and prisons. He also pledged to immediately end the practice of charging minors as adults and will make victims’ services available to families of those shot and killed by law enforcement officers. The District Attorney’s office will also not require victims of crime to testify against perpetrators in order to gain access to victims’ services. If victims do not have to testify to get help that just means more criminals will go untried and unconvicted. The death penalty bit makes little difference: California has 725 people on death row but only 13 executions since the restoration of capital punishment in 1976. The Pyrite State has not executed anyone since January 17 2006. Sentencing people to capital punishment only means spending more money on them. But releasing accused criminals without bail? All that does is invite them to commit more crimes. Gascon a retired Los Angeles police officer has served as both police chief and district attorney for San Francisco. As that city’s lead prosecutor Gascon authored a ballot measure to reduce some felonies to misdemeanors including some thefts which led San Francisco to have the nation’s highest property crime rate per capita in the U.S. according to the Associated Press. This is what ‘social justice’ law enforcement gets us: less law enforcement and more crime. Everything the social justice warriors touch turns out badly.
