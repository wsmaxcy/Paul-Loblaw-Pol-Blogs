L, The Trump Pence Thing Is Downright Shakespearian, driftglass, 2021-07-01, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Like the Duke of Buckingham in Shakespeare's Richard III Mike Pence is a fundamentally hollow immoral thug who was perfectly willing to help Trump win the White House and once he was installed perfectly willing to abet his every destructive corrupt totalitarian impulse -- all hinging on the promise of the rewards to come for his faithful groveling service. And then one day  to insure his grip on power Trump asked Pence to something that brought him up short.  Pence hemmed and hawed and stalled and (I assume) behind closed doors gently reminded Trump of his faithful groveling service up to that point and the rewards (we can all safely assume) he had been promised for that service. But just as in the play the minute Trump's Buckingham definitively refused to murder democracy in its bed in order to help a tyrant hang onto power Trump immediately turned on him and began plotting his destruction.      Duke of Buckingham: Is it even so? rewards he my true serviceWith such deep contempt made I him king for this?O let me think on Hastings and be goneTo Brecknock while my fearful head is on! All of this evidently came as a complete surprise to Pence who is a dull generic Republican hack with "wit’s as thick as a Tewkesbury mustard" and who has obviously never read you-know-who.   For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
