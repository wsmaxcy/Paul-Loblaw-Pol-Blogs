L, RED or BLUE BLUE or REDRepresentation On Health Care It Is Dead...and has been since the 1960s, ExperimentFading, 2021-05-01, An Inglorious 109-year American Health Care History In the first decade of the 20th century we knew we were ruining the climate lead was deadly and the multipayer financing of health care would be profitable and ruinous.  Nationalizing health insurance was first proposed by Teddy Roosevelt (R) in 1912. During the 20th century it was the physician profession (via the American Medical Association) who created the systemless multipayer health care system AND funded the creation of the public relations machine to protect it all from reform. The most notable and informative battle in the 109-year fight over the fixing of the financing of health care took place in California in 1945. It was a battle between The California Medical Association and California Governor Earl Warren (R). This bit of California history is told very well here (and not at all in our schools). This pointedly relevant New Yorker article is long. To cut to the chase start reading at “Warren got a serious kidney infection”. Then! Then in the 1960s the non-profit insurance companies called “The Blues” realized those Billions and Billions and Billions in profits and so became for-profit entities.  The Billions in profits captured by the non-profit insurance companies would by decree of courts and electeds be given over to newly formed private entities called health insurance conversion foundations. Take home lesson here:  From the moment the non-profit insurance companies became multi-Billion dollar for-profit entities our electeds -- red and blue took on the national chore of protecting the multipayer financing of American health care. This was the moment representation on the issue of health care ceased to exist in the United States — and a monster called the Medical Industrial Complex was birthed. The American Medical Industrial Complex well defended by elected and a sophisticated and saturating public relations reach now has sights set globally.  __________________________________________________  HEADS-UP WORLD!! The American Medical Industrial Complex Your Way Cometh! Make haste to defend! It won’t arrive in a blitzkreig it’s already there. Trust no agent of any American health care foundation. Meanwhile we Americans ought get around to acknowledging the MIC monster dancing upon our heads and lives and get around to standing and defending.
