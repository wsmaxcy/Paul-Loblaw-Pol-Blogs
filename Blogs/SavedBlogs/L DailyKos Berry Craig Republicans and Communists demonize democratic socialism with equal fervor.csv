L, Republicans and Communists demonize democratic socialism with equal fervor, Berry Craig, 2021-04-27, By BERRY CRAIG Quick what do Republicans and communists have in common? They demonize west European-style socialism. When Republicans call Democrats “socialists” they want voters to hear “communists.” Okay it was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. But the defunct USSR was a communist dictatorship (and became an authoritarian state under Trump's pal Putin).   While independent Sen. Bernie Sanders who challenged Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination last year is a democratic socialist similar to those in countries like Sweden Biden’s not. Neither is Vice President Kamala Harris. The Democratic party isn’t a democratic socialist party either. In terms of world politics the Democratic party is centrist. Globally the GOP is way out on the far right-wing fringes. Large democratic socialist or social democratic parties are common throughout western Europe including in NATO countries. So are labor parties which embrace democratic socialism/social democracy. (The U.S. is the only industrial democracy without a viable democratic socialist social democratic or labor party.) Anyway the Soviets hated all forms of democratic socialism. (So did Hitler and the Nazis.)  What is ‘Democratic Socialism?’ an English language paperback book published in Moscow in 1978 parroted the Communist Party line dissing democratic socialism with the same ardor as today’s GOP. “‘Democratic socialism’ whatever its guise is nothing more than a reformist and bourgeois alternative to existing socialism [communism] which historically speaking is the only possible form of socialism” the book says. Democratic socialist parties would beg to differ. So would Sanders. The book claims that democratic socialist parties “all have one characteristic in common—a denial of scientific socialism [communism] and its basic ideas on the necessity for the radical revolutionary transformation of capitalist society the abolition of private ownership of the means of production and the whole system of capitalist social relations.” Democratic socialist social democratic and labor parties stand guilty as charged. They want reform only by the ballot box not by the bullet. They favor mixed public-private economies in which governments operate certain larger enterprises deemed vital to the well-being of the whole country—such as health care airlines railroads communications systems and public utilities. In addition they support free trade unions and meaningful laws protecting workers consumers and the environment against the greedy excesses inherent in unregulated capitalism. In short democratic socialist social democratic and labor parties have brought genuine democracy security and prosperity to millions of people.  Of course Republican red-baiting goes way back. GOP reactionaries said Franklin D. Roosevelt was a socialist. “I am a Christian and a Democrat”  the 32nd president responded. (Sounds like Biden and Harris.) “Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years" recalled his successor Harry S. Truman a Democrat Southern Baptist and fierce anti-communist. “Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. “Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people.” The Republicans stepped up the “socialist” slamming against President Barack Obama. In 2012 when Obama was up for reelection (and won again) I asked a real socialist if he considered the Democrat in the White House a kindred spirit. “Obama’s policies and actions during the entire four years of his presidency are based on his total embrace of capitalism and protecting America’s capitalistic economic system” harrumphed Brian Patrick Moore the 2008 Socialist candidate for president.  Meanwhile an evidently growing number of Americans are proud to call themselves “socialists” or they don’t think “socialism” is a dirty word. There are Christian socialists too. Labor leader Eugene V. Debs who ran for president five times on the Socialist ticket in the early 20th century said socialism was “merely Christianity in action” because “it recognizes the equality in men.” Religious rightists get apoplectic at any linkage between their version of the Christian faith and socialism. Many of them are Republicans who act like “GOP” stands for “God’s Own Party.”  But during Debs’ day a nationwide Christian Socialist movement included adherents in Kentucky many in Louisville. In 1911 a second annual Christian Socialist camp meeting in rural Graves County reportedly attracted 800 people.    “Democracy and socialism go hand in hand” says the website of the more than 92000-member Democratic Socialists of America. The website also points out that “socialists have been among the harshest critics of authoritarian Communist states.”  (DSA has chapters in all 50 states; there are chapters in Louisville and Lexington and an organizing committee in Bowling Green according to the website.) “The Republicans really don’t believe [Obama is] a socialist” Moore also told me. “They just know calling him one gives them an edge and puts the Democrats on the defensive.” They’re bashing Biden and the rest of his party as socialists for the same cynical reason. But it could be that the GOP is screeching “socialist!” at Democrats so shrilly is because they fear they’re losing that edge.
