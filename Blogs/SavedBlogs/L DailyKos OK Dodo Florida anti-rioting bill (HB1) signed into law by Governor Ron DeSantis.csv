L, Florida "anti-rioting" bill (HB1) signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, OK Dodo, 2021-04-19, Amid racial unrest Florida governor Ron DeSantis has now signed HB1 also known as “The Combatting Violence Disorder and Looting and Law Enforcement Protection Act”. The bill includes stiffer penalties for people who either block roadways during a protest or topple/deface monuments and statues; destroying monuments could carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years. In addition there will be increased penalties for protesters who clash with law enforcement and local governments will have no right to civil liability protections if they happen to intervene on law enforcement’s efforts to respond to a protest that may have turned violent. The bill also includes a provision that gives immunity to motorists who hit protesters on the road; it’s not unlike Florida’s Stand Your Ground law but in this case it’s with cars and protesters. DeSantis believes that defunding the police is “an insane theory”.  “We put out a vision for the state to maintain being a law and order state” DeSantis said. “We saw really unprecedented disorder and rioting throughout the summer of 2020 and we said that’s not going to happen here in the state of Florida.” The governor touted the scope of the newly signed law. “It is the strongest anti-rioting pro-law enforcement piece of legislation in the country. There’s just nothing even close.” However the bill is not without harsh criticism. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has denounced HB1 with Micah Kubic the executive director of the ACLU of Florida stating that the bill “was purposely designed to embolden the disparate police treatment we have seen over and over again directed towards Black and brown people who are exercising their constitutional right to protest”.   Florida Senate passes "anti-riot" bill:-grants civil legal immunity to ppl who drive through protesters in the road-ppl arrested during protests cant bail out until 1st court appearance-6month mandatory sentence for battery on a cop during protesthttps://t.co/Eax0LTvDiH  Ron Desantis is signing a law today that makes 9 people standing on a street a felony denies protestors bail and removes civil liability for running over people during a protest.Ron Desantis is a fascist.
