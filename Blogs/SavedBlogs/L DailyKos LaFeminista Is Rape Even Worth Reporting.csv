L, Is Rape Even Worth Reporting?, LaFeminista, 2021-07-01, ‘I am furious’: shock and anger after Bill Cosby’s conviction overturned The surprise reversal of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction by Pennsylvania’s highest court on Wednesday drew widespread shock and fury – particularly in and around Hollywood where the comedian was once a sitcom titan known as “America’s Dad”.  Justice David Wecht wrote that Cosby had relied on the former prosecutor’s decision not to charge him when he gave potentially incriminating testimony in Constand’s prior civil suit. Laws on bad actors differ by state but the reversal could make prosecutors wary of calling other accusers in similar cases. Shock fury and a lot of tears. Is it any surprise that: In 2017 roughly 42 rapes were reported for every 100000 US residents. That’s approximately 136000 rapes according to the FBI‘s latest data. Considering the majority of rapes aren’t reported however the actual number is closer to 300000. Of the share of rapes that gets reported only about a third is ever cleared—that is in only one of every three cases is at least one offender identified and charged with the crime. This doesn’t mean the offender is convicted though. Less than 1% of rapes lead to felony convictions. At least 89% of victims face emotional and physical consequences. About 0.7 percent of rapes and attempted rapes end with a felony conviction for the perpetrator according to an estimate based on the best of the imperfect measures available. On the other side of the incident at least 89 percent of victims report some level of distress including high rates of physical injury post-traumatic stress disorder depression anxiety and substance abuse. And when one predator is finally caught They let him fucking go.
