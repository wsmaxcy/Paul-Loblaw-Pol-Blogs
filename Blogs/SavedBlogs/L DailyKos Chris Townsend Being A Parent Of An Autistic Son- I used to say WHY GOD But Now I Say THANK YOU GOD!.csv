L, Being A Parent Of An Autistic Son- I used to say WHY GOD But Now I Say THANK YOU GOD!, Chris Townsend, 2021-04-28, Almost 20 years ago I was given the greatest gift by God my son Christian. He was a cute little peanut. He had a head of dark brown hair like a mop. He was the most beautiful most perfect thing I ever saw. I was instantly in love. As he started through his first year and a half we started noticing he was not developing like other kids his age . He wasn’t crawling or trying to walk. He wasn’t doing the typical babble babies do that lead to their first words. We were worried he might have Autism. We were unfortunately right.   This is the moment that changed my life forever.   It was hard very hard news to accept. I had worked when I was younger with Autistic Children in various group homes. I was very familiar with the population but it’s different when it’s your child. I remember telling my parents that their Grandson was Autistic. They were trying to be strong for me but I knew their hearts were breaking. They knew the struggle we were going to face in the coming years. I knew the struggles.  I had looked forward for so long to have a Son that I could share my love of Baseball art and music but now I had to readjust my dreams for his life. In the beginning my hope was that he would speak. I just wanted to hear my Son say “Daddy”. I want to hear him ask me to read him a story. I wanted to hear him say “ I love you!”. Unfortunately it would take many more years before I heard him speak. I had to change my expectations but the one thing that didn’t change was my love for him.  Having knowledge of Children with Autism I knew that early intervention was the key. We got him in a special day program and we had neurological and functional testing done. We learned as time went on that he was closer to the severe end of the spectrum. This was another heartbreak knowing that his struggles were going to be bigger and tougher then we thought.   Not that life was already tough enough I ended up going through a tough divorce from Christian’s Mother. I vowed I wouldn’t let this effect his care. We would have to put our differences aside and work together for Christian’s sake. It wasn’t easy at times and sometimes it was downright difficult but we found a way to do it for the better of our Son. That’s what you do when you love someone so much.   As much as I loved Christian there were moments that tested my patiences and strength. It was sad to watch his meltdowns. It was hard not be able to hug him because he wasn’t comfortable sometimes with physical contact. I wanted so bad to talk with him but his language was limited and his social skills were very poor. He preferred solitude over being around people.He had issues with communicating pain and problems. He often got flustered and self abusive when faced with a problem he couldn’t communicate.  It wasn’t all bad. Honestly there are has been more good days then bad. There has been trips to the beach and watching the joy on his face. He enjoys bowling video games and animals. I remember a special trip to the Bronx Zoo. For a moment watching him enjoy the variety of exotic animals and everything going on it just seemed like a normal outing. The most amazing day was on a summer trip. We were sitting watching TV in the house we rented. Christian and I were sitting on the couch and he turned to me and said “I love you Daddy.” I’m not too proud to admit that I cried. It was the moment I had been waiting to happen for many years. It was a beautiful perfect moment.  As he has gotten older we have learned more effective ways to deal with meltdowns and unexpected issues.We have learned to read his moods and his body language. He also has become more vocal. He has learned to find a way to communicate his needs. Also he has become very proficient with computers. It’s amazing what he can do despite his limitations. I still need to dress and bath him. He needs help with the bathroom but at least he uses the toilet and is not wearing diapers. He has also has found a unique sense of humor. His laugh is truly infectious. Christian really has grown in so many ways.  In the end despite the struggles and heartache having Christian has made me look at life different. It has made me a better person. I thank God every day for bringing him into my life.
