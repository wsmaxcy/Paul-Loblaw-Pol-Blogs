L, As a birthday gift to myself: Can you name a song whose title asks a question? Updated! Thank you!, CameronProf, 2021-04-21, I turn 52 today. Not much of a celebration. Wake up have an outside ordered breakfast. Fall asleep. wake up at 12 to an outside order. Fall back again to sleep and repeat for dinner. Ate now writing this diary. Loneliness depression and living in a nursing home do not a good birthday make.  So just a simple diary tonight I am hoping and thinking that it will get a lot of responses: Please post a song that in it’s title there is a question.  In your answer if possible please post the song video or a picture of it or the group.  I answer the challenge with a dance song that was hot when I was in my club years in 1993: "What is love?”  You are up next.  Wow everyone thank you to every single one of you who posted if I tried to thank each one individually it would make an huge diary even bigger. Sorry if the bandwidth issues made it so the diary hung up on you that was far from my intent. Thank you again to everyone wishing me a merry birthday or sharing from their own birthday. Thanks to Kos & Crew for hosting such a groovy website thank you specifically to Northern Pol for posting actual videos for people who named songs but either did not know how to post them or for whatever reason to post them as a follow-up and a huge thank you to the guy I have a huge crush on (Though he does not know it till now) Jayden whose musical posts made me fall in love with him at first sight. If I was not so unattractive and in my situation I would propose to him sight unseen. :)  Anyways thanks to all once again.
