C, Catch Me Tonight On the Laura Ingraham Show, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-11, I will be a guest tonight on Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show The Ingraham Angle at 9:00 Central 10:00 Eastern. I believe I will be on with Victor Davis Hanson talking about which party should be reeling and about Big Tech’s suppression of free speech. Please tune in! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
