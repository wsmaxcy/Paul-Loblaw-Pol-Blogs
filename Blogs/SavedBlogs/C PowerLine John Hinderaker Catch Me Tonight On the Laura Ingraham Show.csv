C, Catch Me Tonight on the Laura Ingraham Show, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-29, Laura Ingraham’s TV show has booked me for this entire week to talk about the Derek Chauvin trial. I probably won’t be on every night depending on the news cycle but I will be on tonight along with Alan Dershowitz I believe at around 10:20 Eastern 9:20 Central. Please tune in it was an eventful first day of trial today. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
