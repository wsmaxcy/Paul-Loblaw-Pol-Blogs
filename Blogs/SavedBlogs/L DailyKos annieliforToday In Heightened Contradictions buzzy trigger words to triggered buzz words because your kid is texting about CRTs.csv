Cotton’s Anti-1619 Project Bill Will Protect StudentsThe Texas Public Policy Foundation praised the introduction of the “Saving American History Act of 2021” by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. The bill would prohibit federal funds from being used by public elementary and secondary schools to teach the New York Times’ “1619 Project” which claims that slavery is the foundation of America’s success in the world.   “Teaching...

This idea that racism may be embedded in governmental or social systems is the crux of critical race theory. Racism the theory postulates isn’t simply a function of racist people acting out against others because of their race. Instead some of racism’s most significant effects are felt from long-standing systems that have integrated often invisibly race-specific differences. That the Black Lives Matter movement has been so successful at drawing attention to issues of race and racism though means that it’s much easier to notice complaints about systemic racism than it is to notice the racism itself. It means that there are good-faith but clumsy efforts to draw attention to issues of race that have little to do with critical race theory but which become a focal point of aggravation. It also means that groups that benefit from systemic advantages — mostly White Americans — may feel that they are the ones being criticized. If you don’t see the purported racism but feel that you’re being held to account for it frustration would naturally result. This frustration is politically useful. There has been a concerted push by Republican lawmakers to oppose efforts to teach critical race theory a descriptor that’s increasingly being used in a vague sense to describe any number of race-related issues. States have passed laws banning the teaching of critical race theory that only tangentially deal with the theory itself instead often looping in sweeping bans on all sorts of discussions that bear little relationship to systemic racism. www.washingtonpost.com/...
