L, Rudy's Ukrainian big long thing: political skullduggery transcript released, subtropolis, 2021-05-05, This dropped at BuzzfeedNews a few days ago and i’ve only just noticed.  The infamous call in which former president Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do him a “favor” and investigate Hunter Biden and the origins of the Russia probe took place on July 25 2019 and eventually led to the former president’s first impeachment. But the pressure campaign against the Ukrainians started just three days earlier when Rudy Giuliani then the president’s personal lawyer was on a call with a top Zelensky aide asking him to tell the Ukrainian leader to “just let these investigations go forward.” Giuliani's call was to Andriy Yermak who was President Zelensky's top foreign policy advisor at the time and is now his chief of staff. Also on the call was Kurt Volker Dipshit's special envoy to Ukraine and Igor Novikov another advisor to Zelensky and the person who provided the transcript to Buzzfeed. It's unknown whether Gordon Sondland was listening in on speaker from a cafe in downtown Kyiv. “I was dumbstruck. My expectation was that this would be a 'hello nice to meet you' kind of call and instead I was witnessing Rudy dishing out crazy conspiracies and Yermak agreeing with them” Novikov said. “That was the exact moment when I realized that we were in big trouble.” Do go read the article which includes the embedded transcript. But let's jump in to examine a few choice quotes. Emphasis is mine. Parens () for clarification are in the original; [sic] is mine. The French quotation marks (« ») or guillemets are in the original (presumably to suggest air quotes) although i’ve added space around them. (illegible) should probably be (unintelligible) unless this document was prepared from handwritten notes which i doubt. My involvement in this came about because way back last november I got information from a reliable investigator international investigator that there was a certain amount of activity in the Ukraine during the 2016 election that was ... that involved Ukrainian officials and Ukrainian citizens ... mostly officials being asked by our embassy and possibly by other American officials ... Basically the statement was « to produce dirt on then candidate Trump and Paul Manafort ». And that ... just to shorten a big long thing ... over a course of about four or five months they did produce information about Manafort and about the Trump campaign and even possibly about Trump [?!] ... and that it was the most prominent thing being this Black Ledger of Manafort's which was found on the doorstep of a parliamentarian ... (illegible) ... and then delivered to the embassy the FBI ... I don't ... I think the Ukrainian inspector general ... and also given to the press. And it was one operative of the Democratic National Committee a woman named Chalupa. Before i go any further we need to look at the fixation with Ukraine by the Trump “administration”. It isn’t just that they were trying to take eyes off Russia by bullying the Ukrainians (who were already being bullied quite enough). There’s a very specific reason that they wanted to lean on this country: Ukraine Intelligence had cooperated with FBI investigators producing evidence of Manafort’s sketchiness. Giuliani makes it clear right from the start that this is very sensitive to the Trump machine. He next attempts to chastise the Ukrainians by suggesting that Manafort’s ledger had been loosely handled slipping in the FBI as presumably a party which never should have seen such obvious fakery. He then takes a swipe at Alexandra Chalupa who had consulted to Obama’s National Security Council on what had been going on in Ukraine. During the election campaign she also consulted with the DNC and is credited with first bringing to light Paul Manafort’s skeevy arrangement with the Russians. Thus she’s a big-time Trump conspiracy target. Because with a name like Chalupa she must be anteeeee-fah amirite?  And then the only thing that threw it off was the statement about the investigation because they've been like a political football for three years. On again … off again … on again … off again. And uh and then some of the people that we [sic] around you who seem to have let's call it the typical background of you know corruption and political … political skullduggery. I guess. Those are the things that created a problem. I believe that what he’s trying to do here is to suggest that certain corrupt people around Zelensky had led him to disturb the relationship with the US Trump by allowing him to say The Wrong Thing.  But just that everyone looked at it as you know … you know like your election … I remember the election you had when (illegible) … all started it … Viktor … and excuse me I always pronounce … the first Viktor who became president … I always pronounce his name wrong … Yuschenko … Right. I remember that they wrote there was a lot of questions about the integrity of that election and then eventually he was in power … correctly I think. Your election had no questions about the validity of the election which is very good. I have to tell you that President Trump was enormously impressed with that (Zelensky's election results). And I was in politics long enough and I never got 73%. Not even close to it. He’s saying here that they’re aware that there’s a lot of corruption in Ukraine elections; there are questions which don’t always get a lot of attention. That Trump is “impressed” that Zelensky did so well. When a mobster is impressed by something that you’ve done look out — you’ve probably dented his ego in some way and he’ll hold it against you.  Because the relationship with Poroshenko was as you might imagine … it started off very very good and then lots of problems. If only there weren’t these problems!  Kurt I was about to follow up on what you just said which is: if he (Zelensky) could say something like that (illegible) ... his own in the conversation; it would go a long way. It would go a long way with the President (Trump) to solve the problems. Or the issue. Or the question. Let's not call it a problem. Let's call it there's a question in the president's mind.  This all might be fine for a corrupt minion who was backed by a quarter-billion dollar war chest. But then Rudy Giuliani might go through some things let’s be serious.
