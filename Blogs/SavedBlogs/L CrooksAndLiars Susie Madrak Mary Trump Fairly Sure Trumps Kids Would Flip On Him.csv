L, Mary Trump: 'Fairly Sure' Trump's Kids Would Flip On Him, Susie Madrak, 2021-06-08, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Mary Trump talked to Chris Cuomo last night about whether Trump would protect his kids from legal jeopardy. "Well look I said to the audience in the tease leading up to this segment you're suing him" Cuomo said. "You have your own issues with him and your own theories about his perfidy or his wrongdoing and his knowledge where finances are involved. Here is my question. Understanding the family the way you do what would it mean to Donald Trump if they came after his kids in an organization like this?  "I'm not wishing that. I don't wish it on any family. But what I'm saying is the facts what the facts are. Would that change his disposition do you think? would he take one for his kids?" "No he wouldn't" Trump said. "I think if that were to happen if prosecutors were to go after his children he would fully expect them to take a hit for him to benefit him. What he probably doesn't understand is that's not really how it works you know. They always try to get people to flip so they can go after the bigger target. But Donald would never imagine in a million years that his children would do that although I'm fairly sure they would. Ao it's -- if that indeed happens it's going to be fascinating because he would never do anything to protect them if it were at his expense." "How you know?" Cuomo said. "I've known him my whole life and unfortunately I've had to analyze him pretty closely over the last four or five years. This is someone who's never changed. He doesn't evolve. And as you said earlier he has one thing he cares about and that's himself. That will never ever change no matter who gets in his way no matter who gets hurt even if it's his kids."
