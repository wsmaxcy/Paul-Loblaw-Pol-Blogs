C, BLM Founder Cashes In, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-10, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors calls herself a “trained Marxist” and is a bitter enemy of free enterprise but that doesn’t mean that she can’t enjoy the finer things in life. The Daily Mail reports that she has bought herself a $1.4 million home in an exclusive section of Los Angeles that is almost entirely white: A Black Lives Matter co-founder and self-professed ‘trained Marxist’ has raised eyebrows by purchasing a $1.4 million Los Angeles home in a largely white district. Patrisse Cullors a 37-year-old ‘artist organizer and freedom fighter’ has bought a three bedroom three bathroom house in Topanga Canyon complete with a separate guest house and expansive back yard. “Freedom fighting” pays very well these days. The AP reported that Black Lives Matter took in $90 million in donations last year. It’s not clear if or how Cullors is paid by the organization as its finances are opaque. That last observation is very true. But with $90 million rattling around in BLM’s coffers it is not surprising that its leaders have cashed in. More on the house and its environs: In her new zip code 88 per cent of residents are white and 1.8 per cent black according to the census. This is what it looks like. The main house not the guest lodge:  It has been obvious from the beginning that BLM is a hustle much like the Southern “Poverty” Law Center. Nevertheless as you would expect the social media titans are running interference for Cullors and her fellow scammers: Jason Whitlock a sports journalist tweeted that: ‘She had a lot of options on where to live. She chose one of the whitest places in California. She’ll have her pick of white cops and white people to complain about. That’s a choice bro.’ So Whitlock’s account was blocked by Twitter. Some truths are just too inconvenient. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
