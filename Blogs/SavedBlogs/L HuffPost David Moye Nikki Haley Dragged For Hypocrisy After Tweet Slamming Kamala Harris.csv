L, Nikki Haley Dragged For Hypocrisy After Tweet Slamming Kamala Harris, David Moye, 2021-05-31, Former South Carolina Gov.¬†Nikki Haley attempted to score cheap political points against Vice President¬†Kamala Harris this weekend only to end up dragged for her own hypocrisy. It all started Saturday when the vice president tweeted ‚ÄúEnjoy the long weekend.‚Äù Enjoy the long weekend. pic.twitter.com/ilGOrod4AW Many conservatives expressed dismay at the seemingly benign tweet because it didn‚Äôt mention the reason for the holiday weekend: Memorial Day. Harris‚Äô tweet became a sore subject for people who felt the veep wasn‚Äôt honoring vets according to Fox News. One of those was Haley who called Harris ‚Äúunprofessional and unfit.‚Äù Unprofessional and unfit. https://t.co/XuMo7W5i6d But things got topsy-turvy after that tweet.¬† On Sunday Harris posted a tweet directly honoring the troops and Memorial Day. Throughout our history our service men and women have risked everything to defend our freedoms and our country. As we prepare to honor them on Memorial Day we remember their service and their sacrifice. Haley posted her own performative¬†Memorial Day tweet about the troops on Monday but then turned around and wrote a holiday post focused on spending time with her son ‚Äï what some would consider enjoying a long weekend with him. Thankful on this Memorial Day for the blessings of family and spending time with my little one. #notsolittleanymore‚ù§Ô∏è #MemorialDay2021 pic.twitter.com/KwUbeE7Iae Not surprisingly many Twitter users accused her of hypocrisy. Unfit and not appropriate. You should be mourning fallen soldiers and not enjoying your day. I mean isn't that what you tweeted out to @VP? https://t.co/pv03iEOGYQ Memorial Day is only for thanking fallen servicemembers and their families according to you. It's not about being thankful for spending a long weekend with family something you criticized our @vp for just yesterday Oh wait you mean it's ok to celebrate what YOU want but not what VP wants? Got it. HYPOCRITE Wait. This doesn't seem patriotic at all. https://t.co/aH5kNmqLW5 What's he have to do with Memorial Day other than that your privilege ensures he'll never have to die in some shitty ditch 7000 miles from home? Your politicizing this day to make cheap points at the expense of Harris' innocent greeting makes you unfit to utter the sentiment. https://t.co/67Pf0CZv4x This just in: @NikkiHaley has the temerity to enjoy her long weekend.#Unprofessional #Unfit https://t.co/PJxvps93ue I'd be really sad if my Mum was a hypocrite. üò¢ https://t.co/i0vIl9RwxY Yikes Nikki. Very unprofessional and unfit. Do better in the future!!!#NotBeBest https://t.co/DS5NVs6GKp However one Twitter user chose to close the circle rather than attack Haley directly. Enjoy your long weekend.#TheGreatFakeMemorialDayOutrage https://t.co/xbMAMjjPb8
