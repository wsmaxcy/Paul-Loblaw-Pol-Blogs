National Superhero Day is for honoring both fictional superheroes and real-life superheroes—those who risk their lives to keep others safe. Both of these heroes are role models for children and even for adults. The day was thought up by employees of Marvel Comics in 1995. There are a countless number of fictional superheroes who are honored on the day such as Batman Superman Wonder Woman and Spiderman. But as a common phrase says "not all heroes wear capes." Real-life heroes put themselves in harm's way and in circumstances where they may risk their lives for others just as their fictional counterparts do. Some of these heroes have careers that put them into these scenarios such as members of law enforcement military personnel and firefighters. Other heroes may be everyday citizens who step up in moments of crisis and do extraordinary things. Other everyday people may not risk their lives but may dress up as superheroes and help others on a daily basis. People from some charities such as Love Your Melon dress up as superheroes on the day and visit children's hospitals.  How to Observe National Superhero Day Celebrate your favorite fictional superheroes today as well as real-life ones who have helped or protected you or others from danger. On the fictional side you could watch movies and read comics of your favorite superheroes. If you have children you could help them dress up as superheroes by helping them make a mask cape and cuffs. You could even dress up as a superhero yourself and help people in your neighborhood or volunteer somewhere to help children.
