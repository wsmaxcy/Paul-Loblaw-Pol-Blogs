L, UK Health Secretary Seen 'Snogging' Aide On CCTV Footage, Ed Scarce, 2021-06-26, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  The video above shows the Health Secretary furtively checking before locking himself in an embrace with his aide Gina Coladangelo. Both of them are married just to other people apparently having known each other at college many years ago. All of this is very salacious and embarrassing for them and their families but it also raises questions as to how the video was obtained and for what purposes. Speculation is that PM Boris Johnson has wanted to get rid of Hancock for a long time and to make him the villain for Britain's inept COVID response before vaccines came on the scene. Johnson called Hancock  "totally fucking hopeless" in secret texts released earlier this month. This latest release seems destined to seal Matt Hancock's fate and his political career making him an altogether convenient scapegoat for Boris Johnson. Source: BBC Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted breaking social distancing guidance after pictures of him kissing an aide were published in a newspaper. He said he had "let people down" after photos emerged of him with Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - and he was "very sorry". Labour urged the PM to sack Mr Hancock calling his position "untenable". But Downing Street said Boris Johnson accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed. A spokesman added that the prime minister had full confidence in the health secretary. The Sun reported that its pictures of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo who are both married with three children had been taken inside the Department of Health on 6 May. UPDATE: And less than 24 hrs after saying he wouldn't resign Hancock just resigned or got fired/sacked. Whatever. I guess he can now spend more time with his wife and kids or at least somebody's wife and kids. pic.twitter.com/ahnqHy6yT9 â€” Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) June 26 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
