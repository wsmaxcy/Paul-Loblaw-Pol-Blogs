L, This Week in the War on Women 5/2-8/2021: Funny Not-Funny Edition, elenacarlenaforThis Week in the War on Women, 2021-05-08, Since I consider myself a sometime comedian I thought I would look into how things are going in the comedy world since the Louis CK scandal and #MeToo. Welp as you might expect things are not particularly good.  As you might recall the comedian was accused by several women of harassment and we kind of thought his career ended at that time in 2017. I was surprised to learn that he actually pretty much admitted what he was accused of; which I suppose is better than some such as $Rump complaining that all his female accusers are lying. His nopology included the belief that he needed to take time off “to listen”. Eye roll. Guys: If you are masturbating in front of people in the workplace you are acting inappropriately and you are making people uncomfortable. Louis really needed to hear this? This should not need to be made explicit since well before the time a young man is old enough to work.  Welp in 2020 Louis CK came back with his Nopology Tour (not its official name). He doubled down:  Man I was in a lot of trouble. Wait 'till they see those pictures of me in blackface. That's gonna make it a lot worse because there's a lot of those. There's thousands of pictures of me in blackface. I can't stop doing it. I like it. I like how it feels. Oh great let’s add a little racism to our sexism. Yes I know it’s a “joke”. But here’s the thing and it’s why Reptublican “comedians” are never funny: Real comedy punches up not down. So it’s OK for example for me to say that Chuck Schumer needs to get his caucus into line: McConnell is like the head of the lion pride cuffing the cubs until they know who is the boss. Schumer is more like the human with pussycats who refuse to eat trying an ever-expanding line of treats in a futile attempt to elicit cooperation. (The below is not 100% representative of the situation. Manchin wishes he looked this good!) OTOH it is not OK for example for me to make fun of the homeless and jobless especially during the pandemic and suggest that they could and should just pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. Racist sexist classist “jokes” are just cruel.  But of course when women comedians object to sexual harassment on the job the response is often “We were just joking.” And the Powers That Be can level accusations that are more deadly in this field than any other: “You have no sense of humor. You can’t take a joke.” And women’s prospects for employment immediately plummet downward.  Of course women push back. There has been more discussion than usual online during the pandemic whilst comedy clubs have mostly been closed and what comedy is available is online. As women speak out more women feel empowered to speak out. Some men have been publicly accused although they have not felt much by way of consequences. Others remain in the women’s whisper network — “There is apparently a growing WhatsApp list of male comics to avoid.”  There are attempts to get organised. In the UK “The Live Comedy Association was recently formed with the aim of helping comedians during lockdown.” They have made their opposition to harassment and abuse explicit. Similarly in Wales women have formed an “HR service” called Get Off which collects funds from comedy venues to provide women with some protection.  Interestingly in the United States so far I was not able to find any such organised efforts. However US female comedians are supporting each other in their efforts to expose abusive men. So far however the main result seems to have been that accused men promise to “do better”. Eye roll again!  Abuse and harassment need to be treated as the crimes that they are. They are a drag on our entire society. Bullies are unlikely to restrict their behavior. Men who abuse women likely also intimidate other men. The worst abusers become mass murderers. We have seen many of those links here so I won’t link them again. But in the comedians’ world as everywhere else prosecutors need to start taking these actions seriously and pursuing criminal charges. If they do women will be more safe. The entire world will be more safe.  Details aren’t known yet but the shooter in the Wisconsin casino was an ex-employee targeting a female employee. He had repeatedly threatened her before and she had a permanent restraining order against him. Top general drops opposition to change in sex assault policy: In a potentially significant shift in the debate over combating sexual assault in the military the nation’s top general says he is dropping his opposition to a proposal to take decisions on sexual assault prosecution out of the hands of commanders. Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stopped short of endorsing the changes recommended by an independent review panel. But in an interview with The Associated Press and CNN Milley said he is now open to considering them because the problem of sexual assault in the military has persisted despite other efforts to solve it.

Heyman Service to America Medal Finalist.  Callie Higgins is a materials research engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). She studies a special branch of additive manufacturing called vat photopolymerization which uses light to solidify a liquid resin layer by layer into a 3D object. Callie is a finalist for a Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal in the Emerging Leaders category which is awarded to federal employees under the age of 35 who have made important contributions early in their professional careers. The Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals are intended to highlight excellence in the federal workforce and inspire other talented and dedicated individuals to go into public service. Tell us about your career path thus far. How did you get here? I fell in love with physics at an early age and knew I wanted to study it throughout my life so...   FROM Medscape: The Federation of State Medical Boards is calling for stronger action on reports of physician sexual misconduct and outlines new recommendations in a viewpoint article published March 29 in JAMA. There’s no free fulltext but here’s the JAMA summary: The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) recently engaged with its member boards and investigators trauma experts physicians resident physicians medical students survivors of physician abuse and the public to critically review practices related to the handling of reports of sexual misconduct (including harassment and abuse) toward patients by physicians. The review was undertaken as part of a core responsibility of boards to protect the public and motivated by concerning reports of unacceptable behavior by physicians. Specific recommendations from the review were adopted by the FSMB’s House of Delegates on May 2 2020 and are highlighted in this Viewpoint.1  FROM Medscape: and American Academy of Neurology: On April 23 the AAN officially acquired it’s 2nd female president ever among 37 total Orly Avitzur MD MBA FAAN. she is joined by Carlayne Jackson MD as president-elect and Janis Miyasaki MD MEd as vice president; as well as five additional women on the board of directors. Under the leadership of Natalia Rost MD MPH chair of the science committee women represented 46% of invited plenary speakers at the [Academy’s annual] meeting and 43% of scientific award winners. This is certainly encouraging for many. Along with a new and welcome spotlight on healthcare equity anti-racism diversity and inclusion that made its way in plenary scientific educational and experiential learning sessions the face of neurology has become more than the "guy with a bow tie" stereotype.  From bionews.org.uk in February — a bit surprising given the locale: A Louisiana federal judge has dismissed a custody claim by Sofia Vergara's former fiancé [Nick Loeb] over their frozen embryos. Vergara and Loeb had IVF treatment together and froze two embryos before ending their engagement in 2014. [Loeb later] expressed wishes to bring them to term using a surrogate publicly stating his belief that life begins at conception. Vergara [withheld consent]. Loeb had originally brought a case in California where Vergara lives and where the embryos were created and stored ... He later withdrew the suit and re-filed in Louisiana – a state which considers embryos judicial persons (in California they are considered property). [The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal in New Orleans] found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case as Loeb 'is not domiciled in does not maintain a residence in and does not have the intent to be domiciled or a resident of any parish in the State of Louisiana'… the court accused Loeb and his lawyer of jurisdiction shopping – deliberately choosing the Louisiana justice system on the basis that it would be more sympathetic to his case... Biden is the first president in modern history to appoint more women than men in his first 100 days: It’s about time! President Biden end the 1033 program demilitarize the police: blacklivesmatter.com/… #End1033. BLM wanted it done by April 30 but the petition link is live and the news still shows 1033 not ended as of this posting. This should concern all of us not only as women but for husbands fathers sons and friends.  War on Women is a compilation with cooperation of the whole crew! Special thanks to mettle fatigue Torilahure SandraLLAP and Angmar for items and discussion this week!  UPDATE: HAPPY MOTHERS’ DAY to All Who Perform Motherly Functions!!
