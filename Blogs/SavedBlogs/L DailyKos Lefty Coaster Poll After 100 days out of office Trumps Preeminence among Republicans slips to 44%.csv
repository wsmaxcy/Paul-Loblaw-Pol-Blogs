L, Poll: After 100 days out of office Trump's Preeminence among Republicans slips to 44%, Lefty Coaster, 2021-04-27,  By Chuck Todd Mark Murray and Carrie Dann  WASHINGTON — Out of office off of Twitter still complaining about the election results — the last 100 days or so haven’t been kind to Donald Trump our new national NBC News poll finds. His ratings among all adults stands at 32 percent favorable 55 percent unfavorable which is down from his rating in January (40 percent favorable 53 percent unfavorable among registered voters) as well as where he was in the poll right before the election (43 percent favorable 52 percent unfavorable among registered voters)  Even Trump’s pull within his own party appears to have lessened with 44 percent of Republicans saying they’re more supporters of Trump than the GOP versus 50 percent who say they’re more supporters of the GOP than the former president. It’s the first time since July 2019 when party supporters have outnumbered Trump supporters in our poll and it’s also the first time that party supporters have reached 50 percent on this question. Strikingly these numbers are coming as the perception of Trump’s pull within his party couldn’t be stronger. GOP politicians are still trekking to Mar-A-Lago. They’re clamoring for his endorsement. And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy continues to hug Trump even after what happened on Jan. 6. Republican politicians seem to be clinging to Trump in desperation while the Republican base is moving away from the cult of personality surrounding Mr. Trump.
