L, Repeat of an earlier diary (with tweaks) on our hero Harvey Milk., CameronProf, 2021-06-29, I wrote a diary a few years back on the sad anniversary of the murder of Harvey Milk by the cowardly murderer Dan White. I repeat that diary here with some tweaks and edits for Pride. November of 1978 was the time part of me died.  Harvey Milk 48 was the first openly gay person to hold public office in the U.S. The San Francisco supervisor battled against then dominating homophobic legislators and groups to the fledgling movement activism in the States.  He made a tape during the last few days before he was murdered.  Below is a partial transcript of his words. The tape began: “This is Harvey Milk speaking on Friday 18 November 1978. This tape is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination. “I fully realize that a person who stands for what I stand for an activist a gay activist becomes the target or potential target for a person who is insecure terrified afraid or very disturbing. “Knowing that I could be assassinated at any moment at any time I feel it’s important that some people know my thoughts and why I did what I did. Almost everything that was done was done with an eye on the gay movement “I cannot prevent some people from feeling angry and frustrated and mad in response to my death but I hope they will take the frustration and madness and instead of demonstrating or anything of that type I would hope that they would take the power and I would hope that five ten one hundred a thousand would rise. “I would like to see every gay lawyer every gay architect come out stand up and let the world know. “That would do more to end prejudice overnight than anybody could imagine.  “All I ask is for the movement to continue and if a bullet should enter my brain let that bullet destroy every closet door.” I initially did not want to mention the name of the coward that killed him and the progressive mayor of San Francisco George Moscone but we need to remember the name and never forget it and the scant *5* year sentence that he served for the murder of 2 public servants: Dan White.  It is much more important to remember the man Milk for his words and actions.  Please join with me to honor a true hero.
