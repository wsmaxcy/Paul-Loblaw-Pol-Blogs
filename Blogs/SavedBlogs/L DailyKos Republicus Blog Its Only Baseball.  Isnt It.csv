L, It's Only Baseball.  Isn't It?, Republicus Blog, 2021-07-01, By RepublicusAmerica  “A new poll shows that majority of Iowa voters disapprove of the job President Biden is doing during his first 5 months in office.”  As the Bidens trotted out to their positions in the top of the second they all noted the red thumbs-down signs waving in the stands. It was a new way to let Iowa fans voice their pleasure or displeasure with the team in the field."What the hell?! " said the Bidens’ manager "We just started and already over half the fans are booing us?""They were expecting a big first inning " said the pitching coach looking at his scorecard. "Five hits but only one run. And that Covide kid just slid in under the tag.""Yeah we should have gotten more. But on Schumer's single Munchkin just stood there on first before running. What the hell was he thinking?""Crazy duck! It was like he wanted to give McCarthy in center fielder a fair chance to throw him out at second.""Cinema didn't help. Took off like a bat out of hell from second then he stopped at 3rd when he could have walked in. And why the hell was he looking at Munchkin instead of the third base coach? Thought he was smarter than that.""Look at that" said the pitching coach pointing to the stands. “The inning hasn't even started and there’s more red thumbs.""That’s why!" shouted the manager pointing furiously across the field at the Trumpers’ dugout. "Look at that SOB McDonald out there shaking his thumbs down riling up the crowd.""Wow!  Look at those blue thumbs disappear! He is an SOB but he sure knows how to rile up a crowd better than we do.""He sure does.  And keeps his players in line too. If Munchkin and Cinema pulled boneheaded plays like that for the Trumpies they wouldn't be able to sit down for a week.""Something to think about Joe " said the pitching coach. "We got to get more runs across before the 7th inning stretch or the stands are going to be solid red."A crack of the bat grabbed their attention as Grassee hit a sharp grounder that Kelly scooped up in the hole and threw to first."Rookie looks pretty good Skipper.""Yeah. Now let's see if he can hit Thume's screwball.""Everybody's got to play hard ball if we're going to win this game."
