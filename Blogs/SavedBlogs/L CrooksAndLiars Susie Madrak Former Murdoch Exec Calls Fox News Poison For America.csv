L, Former Murdoch Exec Calls Fox News 'Poison' For America, Susie Madrak, 2021-07-05, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Preston Padden a man who worked for Rupert Murdoch in the early days of Fox News attacked the network and says Murdoch "owes himself a better legacy than a news channel that no reasonable person would believe." In a Daily Beast opinion piece Padden details all the ways Fox News has gone off the tracks: Fox News has caused many millions of Americans—most of them Republicans (as my wife and I were for 50 years)—to believe things that simply are not true. For example Yahoo News reports that 73 percent of Republicans blame “left-wing protesters” for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Of course that is ludicrous. All one has to do is look at the pictures or videos of the attack to see that the violent mob was comprised of Trump supporters. Similarly a poll by SSRS in late April found that two-thirds of Republicans either believe or suspect that the election was stolen from Trump—60 percent saying there is “hard evidence” that the election was stolen. As noted above this ridiculous notion has been thoroughly refuted. But millions of Americans believe these falsehoods because they have been drilled into their minds night after night by Fox News. The greatest irony is that I don’t believe that most of the falsehoods on Fox News reflect Rupert Murdoch’s own views. I believe that he thought that it was important to protect his own health by wearing a mask during the pandemic and he encouraged me to do the same. I believe that he thought that it was important to protect his own health by getting vaccinated at the earliest opportunity and he encouraged me to do the same. And I believe that he thinks that former President Trump is an egomaniac who lost the election by turning off voters especially suburban women with his behavior. Over the past nine months I have tried with increasing bluntness to get Rupert to understand the real damage that Fox News is doing to America. I failed and it was arrogant and naïve to ever have thought that I could succeed. I am at a loss to understand why he will not change course. I can only guess that the destructive editorial policy of Fox News is driven by a deep-seated vein of anti-establishment/contrarian thinking in Rupert that at age 90 is not going to change. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
