L, The McConnell Court comes into its own and sets democracy in its sights., outsidethelines, 2021-07-01, Comey Barrett 2020. Kavanaugh 2018. Gorsuch 2017. Alito 2006. Roberts 2005. Mitch McConnell’s stink is on every conservative appointment since Thomas in 1991. For much of his time in the Senate McConnell kept a low profile publicly at least. But here in his hometown those who paid more than passing attention to McConnell understood this: his only concerns were power and money and he was devoted to acquiring as much of both as he humanly could. McConnell’s politics went where the money was and his focus has always been serving those with the most of it. What made McConnell unique was that he understood the advantages of a low profile and absolute discretion as he went about pursuing his goals. His lack of public stature and attention seeking permitted most of his working in the system to go unreported if not unnoticed. First and foremost among this was his absolute obsession with judicial appointments. McConnel made it his life’s mission to seek out highly conservative individuals for judicial appointments partnering primarily with the Federalist Society. Early on within the Senate McConnell had a reputation for being focused on judges but beyond that he was always focused on money. He hated McCain-Feingold campaign finance law and understood that the greater role big money could play in elections the better off the Republican Party would be. Money is speech he argued and the Supreme Court bought into that gutting the law and unleashing the PACs and all that followed. This victory galvanized as if that was needed McConnell’s commitment to creating a conservative dominated judiciary that would wipe away any laws passed by states or Congress that were offensive to the interests supported by the Republican Party. Making Obama a one term president taking our government hostage on budget matters deciding what legislation even gets to be voted on all this flowed from McConnell’s win at all costs partisan warfare. McConnell lies about his reasons for doing things as evidenced in the last 3 confirmations. He lies about the coordinated ideologic standards of judicial nominees. He covers up their records prevents scrutiny and basically says f**k you to the Senate and the public. In a Party in which a strong majority believes Trump won the election McConnell has never had any trouble with double standards hypocrisy or straight up lying if it advanced his goals. Today thanks in large part to Mitch Republican judicial conservative nominees can lie to Congress with impunity and address them with contempt. But underneath it all from day one McConnell’s goal has been this: harnessing the judiciary to undermine democracy for the benefit of the rich and the powerful. Activist conservative judges appointed not for objectivity and respect for the laws passed by Congress but for their contempt of laws that infringe on the rich and powerful. In today’s 6-3 decisions the activism of these judges is blatant. They are not ruling based on law or Constitutional provisions. No deference to or even lip service to legislative intent. They are doing what they were sent to do: advance the power of the already powerful by expressly making it easier and legal for Republicans in power to target and suppress the voters they prefer not cast a vote. To those Democrats that engaged in handwringing over stacking the Court I say this: this is just the beginning. These Republican appointments are not Judges the are conservative warriors. They sit on the Bench because they have been judged by the rich and powerful to be reliable and compliant in serving the rich and powerful and the Republican Party from the bench. I guarantee you McConnell is celebrating Big Time tonight. Unless Democrats finally rise to meet the threat McConnell will enjoy many more celebrations just like this.
