L, Assessing the New Voter Laws in Georgia, noahwil, 2021-04-23, President Joe Biden believes the recent changes to a new law enacted in Georgia are “all by design” to make “Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle”. Since Donald Trump’s term for president ended the Republican Party has gone as far as to publicly embrace voter suppression. Recently Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a set of measures into law that affect the voting process in the state.Several changes have been instituted including requiring voters to include a state id number or a photocopy of an identity form for their absentee ballot application. This change supposedly better ensures the security of the ballot.Another change is that election officials are barred from affirmatively sending out ballot applications allowing voters less time to register for an absentee ballot. An elector may submit a ballot as early as 11 weeks or as late as 11 days before an election. If it is submitted any later the voter risks the completed ballot not getting delivered in time.Additionally the bill drastically limits the availability and hours of drop boxes which truthfully were a pandemic-era innovation in Georgia.Additionally the law expressly authorizes “mass challenges” to voter registration which means that a single citizen may go to a county clerk's office and request that an unspecified number of voters be disqualified from the voter rolls for being ineligible (though such efforts can violate the National Voter Registration Act).One of the more controversial changes is that the law prohibits people from selling food or beverages to voters in line in an effort to discourage partisans from attempting to influence voters outside polling stations. However poll workers may have food and drink for the general public. With this law specifically Black voters are expected to struggle more as a result of voting closures in largely Black areas which have resulted in hours-long queues.Georgia also proposed restricting no-excuse absentee voting to people aged 65 and over.Supporters of the bill argue that the old Jim Crow disenfranchised electors en masse based on their race and instituted poll taxes and that the new measures can hardly be called a new Jim Crow when they merely restrict ballot drop boxes to secure locations that cannot be tampered with and have adjustments like weekend voting.The true primary concern is that in the modern day United States accessing a ballot is pretty easy and changes like those cited could start disenfranchising some voters. It is important to note that any kind of voter suppression will not only affect Blacks but also affect poor whites Latinos Asians women and younger people.The importance of this issue cannot be overemphasized and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) dedicates resources to continuously fight voter suppression. The organization also provides information to citizens on how to protect their vote which will probably be a major concern in this era when concerns about the legitimacy of the government was such a hot topic.
