L, DeSantis Faces DiSaster as Hurricane Don Barrels In, Crashing Vor, 2021-07-03, Things are a mite touchy between the former president and his Mini-Me in the Sunshine State. Gov. DeSantis’ victory over Himself in a conservative convention’s straw poll primed the Former’s bile pumps but the storm heading to Sarasota may open the spigot. No not Tropical Storm Elsa which isn’t due to hit town until Tuesday but the shitstorm that is a post-presidential Trump rally hitting town tonight at eight. DeSantis has quietly requested the Self team postpone the Sarasota rally tonight as the unrelenting Self Show might clash with the governor's efforts to portray himself as soberly addressing the horrendous collapse of the Champlain Tower across the state. From the New York Times: The planned political rally in the midst of a disaster that has horrified the nation has become a topic of discussion among aides to the former president and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida a Trump ally whose growing popularity with the former president’s supporters is becoming an increasing source of tension for both men according to people familiar with their thinking. After officials from the governor’s office surveyed the scene of the condominium collapse in Surfside Fla. Adrian Lukis chief of staff to the governor called Michael Glassner a longtime Trump aide who is overseeing the Florida event according to people familiar with the discussion. In a brief conversation Mr. Lukis inquired whether the former president planned to continue with the event given the scale of the tragedy two people said. Trump’s spokesperson told reporters that the rally over three hours away couldn’t possibly impede recovery efforts and besides Himself was ready to help. She added that the former president “has instructed his team to collect relief aid for Surfside families both online and on-site at the Sarasota rally” and said that he planned to address the tragedy in his remarks. (Note: the former president has a fascinating history in the field of non-profit management which people online or on-site are advised to look into before pulling out their credit cards.) Trump is at least according to DeSantis' spokespeople not upset that the governor can’t make it to Sarasota for tonight’s hootenanny and who knows with recent comparisons between the two getting attention in-state maybe it’s best himself won’t be upset by the presence of a potential rival. This ad will be running on local TV tonight about the time of the rally. It’s doubtful Himself will see it but I imagine someone on his staff will.
