L, Moondai Furkids: Marvin and Buzzy's Favorite Guy Just Turned 91, RosebuddearforPWB Peeps, 2021-06-28, That would be my Dad whose birthday was Saturday June 26. He just turned 91. That’s 637 years old in cat years. So he’s pretty old. 😍 Marvin and Buzzy just love their Suspendered God and Dispenser of Treats. He comes over for coffee every morning at 10. At a quarter till or so they start pacing round the kitchen table and whining plaintively should he be a few minutes late. And if for any reason he should miss a day. Well.  He told me not to get him a present since he just got one for Father’s Day. I said sure Dad.  (Of course I got him a present. You think I’m going to let him get cheated just because his birthday is so close to Father’s Day? Perish the thought!)  The boyz just love this guy:   They made him a card:  Happy Monday all! Here at Casa Rose we’ve been celebrating birthdays with gifts and treats. I hope your weekend was great as well! Hugs.
