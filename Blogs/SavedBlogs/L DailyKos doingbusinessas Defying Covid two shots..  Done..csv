L, Defying Covid two shots..  Done., doingbusinessas, 2021-04-18, I got my second shot today…  This one didn’t hurt going in as the vaccinator pinched my deltoid a bit to give more “volume” to give the injection into.  Now 4 hrs later… Starting to run a slightly elevated temp (my normal is 97.7 up to 98.6) feel like a head cold coming on if I sit too long I’m a bit stiff getting up.  About what I would get 4 hrs after a flu shot.  Coworkers have had their second shots and had similar issues and usually spend a day or two afterwards to take it easy at home.  After the dose I was sitting in a chair waiting on my time to go…  I felt a sense of relief a worry going away.  Not like the first dose where I cried with joy at getting it..  But a like I got a true Passover.   I’m alive.  Arrive Alive!!
