L, Supreme Court tosses out one more GOP lawsuit challenging Pennsylvania Mail In Ballot Deadline, Lefty Coaster, 2021-04-19, I hope this is the last of the frivolous Republican lawsuits filed to overturn the results of las Fall’s election. There were previous  Republican suits challenging Pennsylvania mail in ballot deadline.  If a legal strategy fails Republicans keep trying it. The very definition of insanity.  BY HARPER NEIDIG The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a case against Pennsylvania's handling of mail-in ballots dispensing with yet another legal challenge over the 2020 election. The justices released an order on Monday instructing a lower court to dismiss the case as moot. The order did not include an opinion or indicate which justices supported or opposed the move. A Republican congressional candidate and four individual voters filed a federal lawsuit against Pennsylvania elections officials in October after a state court ruled that mail-in ballots could be counted if they were received up to three days after Election Day which legislators had established as the deadline. Not even an opinion. Brushed aside as moot.
