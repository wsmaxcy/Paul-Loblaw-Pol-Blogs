L, Justice Prevails, DeeQuilter86forThe Village, 2021-04-21, Today we can celebrate justice‚Ä¶¬†tomorrow we continue the fight. Derek Chauvin has been convicted on all counts for the murder of George Floyd and has been remanded without bail to jail until sentencing. Most assuredly he will appeal but for today justice has prevailed in this case. There are many many more cases where justice did not. That‚Äôs way the work continues for ALL of us whether we are black Americans or not. The three other police officers involved in this murder¬†will now be tried for aiding in the Floyd‚Äôs death. Their convictions on charges are more likely now that Chauvin has been convicted. Here are more tweets on the trial outcome. The other three officers involved in the killing of George Floyd are scheduled to go on trial on August 23. pic.twitter.com/RrOF7LWAM4  Derek Chauvin's lawyer may cite Rep. Waters and President Biden's comments in an appeal‚Äîbut legal experts say that's highly unlikely to work.Ex-SDNY prosecutor @JenGRodgers and defense attorney @Popehat break down why in phone interviews with me. https://t.co/5I4b4ti5ki  George Floyd's brother Rodney on guilty Derek Chauvin verdict: 'No family in history got this far' https://t.co/jGhvLgxQOO So much truth here: Darnella Frazier demonstrated courage and perseverance in filming what she knew was wrong. This verdict does not happen without her. Thank you Darnella; you have changed our country forever.  In other news‚Ä¶¬†idiot Kevin McCarthy (Q-CA) wanted to censure Maxine Waters claiming she incited violence with her remarks on the trial. The House voted today to table that censure motion along party lines. Unfortunately for us the GOP is not a functioning party anymore. They are just a collection of Twitter trolls performing for Fox News and their rabid base. Val Demings and Hakeem Jeffries are getting tired of the BS‚Ä¶¬†(ignore the Steve Scalise video...ugh!) It's interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it's politically convenient to do so but not when police officers who protect us every day here at the Capitol were fighting for their lives because of the Big Lie. @HouseJudiciary pic.twitter.com/x9i9LO5AAi  Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) slams Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) for wanting to censure Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA):"Lauren Boebert is a mess. Matt Gaetz is a mess. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a mess. Clean up your mess Kevin." pic.twitter.com/OpenTDA9xx We all need to work as hard as we did in 2020 to increase our numbers in Congress in 2022! We can not let the party of fascists¬†and white supremacy to have any levers of power. More from Twitter: President Biden and VP Harris call the Floyd family after the GUILTY verdict! Thank you @POTUS & @VP for your support! We hope that we can count on you for the police reform we NEED in America! ‚úäüèæ pic.twitter.com/cg4V2D5tlI  Hillary has the right words: George Floyd's family and community deserved for his killer to be held accountable. Today they got that accountability. Always and forever Black lives matter. Keith Ellison: MN Attorney General @keithellison on those who witnessed George Floyd‚Äôs death:‚ÄúThey stopped and they raised their voices and even challenged authority because they saw his humanity. They knew it was wrong - and they were right.‚Äù#DerekChauvinTrial OK‚Ä¶¬†That‚Äôs all for now. Chat away!
