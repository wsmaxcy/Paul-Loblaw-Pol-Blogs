C, Soft-on-Russia-Biden rejects State Department’s advice on sanctions, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-06-17, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is no one’s idea of a hardliner. For example he’s leading the charge to appease Iran in the hope that with the pot sweetened the mullahs will permit the U.S. to reenter the nuclear deal. But Blinken is what passes for a hardliner in the feckless Biden administration.  Reportedly he strongly urged Joe Biden to sanction the company and the CEO behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. That pipeline is  vital to Russia’s interests in its quest to use oil and gas to isolate Ukraine and leverage its way to power in Europe.  Blinken was joined in his push for sanctions by his deputy Wendy Sherman a major foreign policy player in past Democratic administrations. Key congressional Democrats including Senate Foreign Relations Committee head Robert Menendez also wanted the sanctions. But Biden declined to impose them. And in  related news Biden also decided not provide a package of lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine. Congress authorized him to supply the aid worth tens of millions of dollars but Biden didn’t follow through. Donald Trump made the opposite decisions. He stood in the way of Nord Stream 2 and he suppled congressionally-authorized aid to Ukraine albeit after trying briefly to leverage it to his political advantage. Imagine if instead Trump had done what Biden is doing. He would be accused of selling out to Russia and indeed of being Putin’s stooge.  Yet Biden’s decisions barely rate a mention in the mainstream media. There’s a good chance you didn’t know about the decision to withhold aid to Ukraine. What are Team Biden’s excuses for these decisions? On the pipeline his apologists such as  the Washington Post argue that Biden didn’t want to “inflame relations” with Germany and that the pipeline is basically a fait accompli at this point. (The Post by the way calls Biden’s Russia policy “a mix of confrontation and cooperation.” There’s a name for that: incoherence.) These excuses are self-contradictory. If the sanctions won’t stop the pipeline it’s impossible to believe that sanctions aimed at halting it will have a significant effect on our relations with Germany. Anyway since when does Germany dictate U.S. policy towards Russia? If Ronald Reagan had listened to Europeans during the Cold War that conflict might have lingered on for at least another decade. The excuse for not aiding Ukraine is that Russia withdrew troops from the Ukrainian border. So what? Russia could bring back its troops and send them into Ukraine in short order. Indeed the less well-equipped Ukraine is the more likely it is that Putin will launch an attack. The notion that foreign troops need to be amassed on one’s border before a nation fully prepares to defend itself from an enemy is ludicrous. No nation follows this policy. If Biden were serious about opposing Russia he wouldn’t have put Ukraine in that position. When Trump was president Joe Biden pretended to be serious about opposing Russia. Now that Biden is in power he is still pretending.  And by the way where are those hand-wringing Ukraine and Europe hands who testified so earnestly (or mock earnestly) during the first impeachment proceedings about Trump’s betrayal of Ukraine? Can they be reached for comment now? If anything the need to take a hard line on Russia is greater now than during the Trump administration (when by the way Trump did take a hard line through his actions if not always his words). Russia is behind ransom ware attacks on U.S. infrastructure (the real thing not the Democrats’ idea of infrastructure).  Biden’s response? Following in Barack Obama’s footsteps when Russian election interference was the issue he told Putin in effect to  cut it out. Biden then listed  16 sectors considered critical infrastructure under U.S. policy that should be off-limits from attack. He thus seemed to imply that it’s okay to attack other sectors or entities.  Pathetic.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
