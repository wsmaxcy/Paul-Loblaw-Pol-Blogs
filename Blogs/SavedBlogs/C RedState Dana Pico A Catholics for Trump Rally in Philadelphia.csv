C, A Catholics for Trump Rally in Philadelphia, Dana Pico, 2020-10-05, In the United States we do not tax our churches and the First Amendment states in part “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .” However we do not expect our priests and ministers to campaign for specific parties or candidates from the pulpit. Sadly the priest in my very small parish — 26 people took communion today not including the priest and nun — has been pushing without actually saying the party’s or candidate’s names for parishioners to vote for Democrats and Joe Biden. Our pastor recently praised our local bishop the Most Reverend John Stowe who recently said that President Trump is not pro-life. It’s not the first time he has stated that. Bishop Stowe’s public support of homosexuality I have noted previously so I take his words with an extremely large grain of salt. Thus it was refreshing to see strong Catholic support for President Trump. Sister Dede Byrne a Catholic nun and U.S. military veteran who spoke at the Republican national Convention said at a rally in Philadelphia: So many are praying for (President Trump). He’s going to be fine. He’s going to get through this COVID thing. I guess God wanted everyone to know Trump is a tough guy. he’s going to get this he’s been protected and he’s going to get stronger. From The Philadelphia Inquirer: by Sean Collins Walsh | October 4 2020 | Posted: 8:14 PM EDT A group of about 75 mostly Catholic supporters of President Donald Trump’s gathered Sunday in South Philadelphia for an anti-abortion rally the Trump campaign’s first event in the city since the president contracted the coronavirus and was hospitalized. Randall Terry an anti-abortion activist who has been leading a “Stop Biden Express” bus tour asked the crowd to implore their Catholic friends not to vote for the Democratic nominee because of his support for abortion rights. “Our missions from this day to Nov. 3 is very simple: to suppress the Joe Biden Catholic vote. Our mission is to suppress the Joe Biden Catholic vote” Terry said at Marconi Plaza. “So whether they vote for Trump or not is a separate issue. And the way we do that is we say to them ‘What you do to the least of Jesus’ brothers and sisters you do to Jesus.'” A lifelong Catholic Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion but believes that women have a legal right to have one. He was denied the sacrament of eucharist by a priest last year while attending Mass in South Carolina due to his stance on the issue. If elected Biden would be the second Catholic president following John F. Kennedy. There’s more at the original including a thinly-veiled slam at those who decline to wear facemasks noting that at least 35 attendees were not wearing face coverings at the outdoor event. Surprisingly the Inquirer article did not mention that not wearing a mask violated Secretary of Health Richard Levine’s¹ mandatory facemask order as well as that of Mayor Jim Kenney² (D-Philadelphia) the tone was dismissive of any concerns that people might have for individual rights. Some of us who really are Catholic wonder just how much of a “lifelong Catholic” Mr Biden actually is. While his support for abortion is disqualifying by itself his determination to require Catholic nuns to provide birth control coverage and to have the taxpayers pay for abortions go far beyond simply stating that he believes women have a legal right to abortion. Let me be clear here: the Inquirer strongly opposes President Trump and is strongly pro-abortion. Note that the article used “anti-abortion” rather than “pro-life” to describe the rally participants; that’s wholly loaded but it is typical of the editorial bias I expect from The Philadelphia Inquirer.

² – Mayor Kenney’s order states laughably “Violation of this Order does not create grounds for any law enforcement officer to stop detain or arrest any individual on the basis of the failure to comply with this Order.” The “order” is by its own wording unenforceable.
