L, America's Gun Crisis: At least 5 people shot dead in Houston over the past 12 hours, OK Dodo, 2021-07-01, During the past 12 hours at least five people were killed by gun homicide in the city of Houston.  Around 10:30pm last night the Houston Police Department responded to a mass shooting that left two adults and a 6-year-old girl dead in an apartment complex in Southwest Houston. A 10-year-old girl was also shot at the scene right near the elbow. But she is currently in recovery at hospital after “playing dead” in front of the shooter. The girl also managed to contact her grandmother and tell her what happened. A 1-year-old boy who was also present at the scene was left uninjured.   About two hours later another car opened fire at a white Mitsubishi SUV. The driver crashed into a furniture store where he later died.   Ten hours later at around 10:30 am a mother was killed by her husband/boyfriend whilst holding her 1-year-old son at an apartment complex in the Westchase part of West Houston. Authorities say it was a domestic-related dispute. The 1-year-old son was also wounded by gunshot but he is in stable condition after being in hospital.   In response to the first gun incident above one redditor on a post in r/Houston says this: I will much rather take my +1% chance in defending my family with a glock at my side than not and believe people are decent. You never know.  Usually Americans think that excessive gun violence usually happen in third-world regimes. But if people think that you will be unsafe from harm if you do not have a gun on your side then isn’t it safe to say that the US is a failed state? A country in fear of random violence mass shooting or otherwise? Yet every time a law involving gun safety is established Americans act like this (even after several children were killed!):  With permitless carry being legal in Texas beginning in September we will see how safety is affected by loosening gun laws. Surely more guns save lives and reduce crime; I’m pretty sure Houston’s crime rate plummeted below New York City’s after open carry was passed in Texas. Not….  But the fact that more people are migrating to the far-right rendition of Texas away from the “communist” Northeast underscores America’s unrelenting appetite for guns greed and racial hatred. (They call this “freedom”.)
