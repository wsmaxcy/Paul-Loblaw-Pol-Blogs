Melania. Don’t take me. Take Melania.’ He’s going to tell them to take everyone except for himself. That’s just the kind of guy he is.” Cohen served as Trump’s attorney and fixer for years including throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. However in 2018 he turned on Trump and began cooperating with investigators. Cohen ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and campaign finance violations for arranging the hush-money payments from Trump to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Although Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison he was released into home confinement last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
