C, A Trump supporter infiltrated an Antifa group in Sonoma , John Sexton, 2021-04-30, For those not familiar with California geography Sonoma is a city north of San Francisco probably best known for its connection to the state’s wine growing region. Frankly it’s not the sort of place I would think of as a hotbed for Antifa but apparently there is a small group that has recently taken it upon themselves to vandalize and target people for possible doxing. San Francisco’s ABC affiliate was investigating the some recent vandalism including leaving a pig’s head and pig’s blood at the home of an expert witness in the Derek Chauvin trial. Somehow during that investigation they discovered that there was already a Trump supporter who’d been infiltrating one group of activists and keeping records on their activity including recordings of some of their online chats like this one: Marb: “It’s May Day baby like come out and take take somethin’ over with us I don’t I don’t (bleep) know.”
Member: “Let’s kill people. (laughs)”
Marb: “Let’s kill some cops.”
Member: “Yes.” The text sounds a lot more threatening than the audio. In the recording which you can hear below this sounds like college kids larping as radicals. That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be taken seriously. I wonder how much of the dumb behavior these groups get up to is really about college-aged guys trying to impress college-aged women with their commitment to the cause. The group apparently kept a list of people they planned to dox and/or harass and even visited the homes of some individuals late at night to scout and observe. They also appear to have either been directly involved or at least learned about acts of vandalism such as the incident with the pig head before anyone else. The group initially called itself SoCo Antifa but concerns about attracting FBI attention led them to rebrand it SoCo Radical Action. ABC 7 reports that it identified the leader of the group who goes by the name “Marb” online. The I-Team has learned the group’s leader who goes by the screen name “Marb” is a 25-year-old college student who was arrested for “felony assault on a police officer” last year at this Oakland riot after the death of George Floyd; the district attorney declined to file charges… Since we’ve been working on the story Marb has been taking down his social media both the public and private accounts. I don’t support doxing people to harass them but I also don’t think people who vandalize public and private property deserve a pass. It appears Marb’s ID has been passed on to the police so they can investigate his connection to vandalism and possible threats. If the police decide there’s evidence to charge him then we’ll eventually get his name along with a mugshot. As for the infiltrator he said he just saw the group’s manifesto online and sent them a message saying he wanted to help them smash the fash. It wasn’t hard to convince them he was a like-minded comrade. “It felt like seeing Antifa getting sort of a pass all the time from government saying they don’t exist saying that they’re a myth saying that they’re just an idea. You know when obviously they are very real and they’re a big threat” he said. I don’t think he means that this particular group constituted a “big threat” but he’s certainly right that groups like this in places like Portland have done a tremendous amount of damage and largely gone unpunished thanks to progressive DAs who just keep dropping charges against them. Here’s the full report from ABC7.
