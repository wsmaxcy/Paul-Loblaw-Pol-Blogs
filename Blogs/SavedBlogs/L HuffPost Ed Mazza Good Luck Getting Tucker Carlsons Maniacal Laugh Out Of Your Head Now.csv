L, Good Luck Getting Tucker Carlson's Maniacal Laugh Out Of Your Head Now, Ed Mazza, 2021-04-27, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has an unnerving tendency to punctuate his segments with a high-pitched cackle especially when he doesn’t like what a guest has been saying.  Now some brave souls at “The Daily Show” have combined Carlson’s cackle clips into a supercut mixed in with similar laughs from famous films.   “When the script says (obnoxious laughter)” the YouTube description notes: Carlson has come under fire for repeatedly using white supremacist talking points on the air with the Anti-Defamation League this month calling on Fox News to ditch the host.  The network said it is sticking by Carlson.
