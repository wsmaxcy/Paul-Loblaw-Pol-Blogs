L, Pandemic Observations -- April 21 Top 40+ Nations (All Eyes on India):, Irontortoise, 2021-04-22, It looks like worldometers is now starting to include 7-day weekly trends with its daily stats so to avoid any needless duplication I’ll probably be switching over to 14-day stats after this report to provide a somewhat different perspective.  In the meantime despite the progress being made in the US and a number of other countries to rein in the current wave of the Covid-19 pandemic (including Brazil?!) India continues to set all sorts of new and very disastrous records as it almost single-handedly keeps pushing the global total of new cases to ever higher levels.  For 3 straight weeks now India has been increasing the number of its new cases by the staggeringly exponential rate of more than 60% per week and has now exceeded the previous high-water mark set by the US in early January.  Even worse India’s death toll is now accelerating at an even faster clip and could eclipse the horrendous records set by Brazil and the US in another week or two at the current rate. The really important question now is just how much longer this truly insane growth rate can continue before some sort of peak is reached. 7-Day D/1M 7-Day Deaths Weekly Change Change fr Max 7-Day C/1M 7-Day Cases Weekly Change Change fr Max World  11.1  86137  2%  -15%  Rank  World  720  5604916  11%  0%  Weekly New Deaths Table <   > Weekly New Cases Table D/1M = Covid-19 deaths per 1 million population over prior 7 days C/1M = New Covid-19 cases per 1 million population over prior 7 days Weekly Change = Net change from previous week's stats Change fr Max = Net change from week of peak deaths or new case Note:  Only nations with a cumulative total of 100+ Covid-19 fatalities included All data derived from worldometer
