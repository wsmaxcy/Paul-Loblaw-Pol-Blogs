L, Student loan interest forgiveness, BadgerKing, 2021-04-26, While I believe the president should just forgive student loan debt entirely that seems to be rather controversial. What I think can be a small step in the right direction is to forgive the interest on student loan debt. The government should not profit on people’s need for a higher education. It would help millions of people with a stroke of a pen. I just Emailed the Whitehouse saying just that.
