L, Celebrations of "White Freedom", Alan Singer, 2021-07-04, Liberty Freedom and Whiteness: Reviewing Tyler Stovall's "White Freedom: The Racial History of an Idea" — History News Network This is an important book given the political debate over the role racism and slavery have played in U.S. History. It is an important read as the U.S. celebrates Independence Day. Tyler Stovall traces the way liberty (individual rights) and freedom (the absence of restraint) for whites was based on the exploitation of people of African ancestry. White Freedom: The Racial History of an Idea by Tyler Stovall (Princeton NJ: Princeton University press 2021) Tyler Stovall a professor of history and the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Fordham University is a European historian specializing in the history of France. In 2017 Stovall was President of the American Historical Association. In White Freedom: The Racial History of an Idea Stovall defines “white freedom as the belief (and practice) that freedom is central to white identity and that only white people can or should be free” (11). While the definition of white freedom does not necessitate it Stovall believes that in practice white freedom meant the subjugation of other races both to preserve and justify a system that privileged people of European ancestry. It is a history “replete with paradoxes” (18). The era of the European Enlightenment was also the apex of the trans-Atlantic slave trade (102). Starting with the seventeenth century European Enlightenment Stovall traces the way liberty (individual rights) and freedom (the absence of restraint) for whites was based on the exploitation of people of African ancestry in colonized territories and in metropolitan centers. Stovall focusing on France and the United States argues that “two seemingly opposite philosophies liberty and racism are in significant ways not opposites at all” (x). They are reinforcing concepts of the same social system. He cites Edmund Morgan’s study of colonial Virginia where Morgan argues “Racism made it possible for white Virginians to develop a devotion to the equality that English republicans had declared the soul of liberty” (13). Whites in Virginia learned to prize their shared freedom so highly because “they could see every day what it meant to live without it” (12).  Stovall’s book is especially timely given debate in the United States between supporters of the 1619 Project and 1776 Unites over the lingering impact of slavery and racism on contemporary American society. He opens the book by pinpointing what may be the ultimate irony in the history of the United States that the American “Temple of Liberty” the United States Capitol Building was constructed at last in part by enslaved Africans. In a second irony when Congress acknowledged this history in 2007 it renamed the building’s Great Hall Emancipation Hall to recognize the work of the enslaved Africans. Stovall questions the choice of the new name because it was unlikely any of the Africans lived long enough to be emancipated. He calls the name a “mockery” that ignores their actual history and the way liberty has always been identified with and reserved for “whiteness” (5). Liberty and race to Stovall are at the core of “white identity” in the past and in the United States today as racism has shaped the identity of those denied “whiteness.” People of color have historically had to struggle to overcome the identification of freedom with whiteness and to redefine it to include all humanity (7).
