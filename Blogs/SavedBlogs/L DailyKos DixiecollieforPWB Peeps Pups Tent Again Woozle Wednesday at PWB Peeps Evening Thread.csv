L, Pups Tent Again: Woozle Wednesday at PWB Peeps Evening Thread, DixiecollieforPWB Peeps, 2021-06-30, [This is a repeat from last summer. I wasn’t feeling very well today and just couldn’t summon the energy to do new one. But I hope you are like me one who likes repeats of fun diaries or only vaguely remembers pics from the past. Enjoy.] Hello Peeps welcome to our little corner of Woozleville. Yes it’s Woozle Wednesday that day of the week when the PWBP Pooties take the day off and the pooches come to the rescue and take up the slack — well those that are trained not to pull on their leashes. Don’t worry pootie lovers the kitties insist on making an appearance even though it is supposed to be their day off. They just can’t help putting in their two meows worth. Other critters like birdeez farm animals and sometimes wild creatures will also make appearances from time to time. Yes summertime in Woozleville means it is that time of year to go backyard camping. Why backyard camping? Because it’s fun. And it’s close by — just outside our doorsteps. The young doggos have been pestering their seniors to get out the camping gear — after all the most essential component is named after them: Pup tents! Backyard camping means snug sacks stargazing chasing fireflies roasting marshmallows scary stories around the campfire. And if the puppies and their friends get cold they can call Mom or Dad to bring out a blanket or cup of warm kibble. Senior woozles often join in the backyard camping experience too. Sometimes even the hoomins. It’s the perfect mini-getaway. And with all this backyard camping experience we will all be ready for more far flung adventures.  In fact the Woozleville Chamber of Commerce has decided to make tonight an official “Backyard Camping Night.” It’s a way for the entire community to come together in a shared activity while still maintaining social distancing. The woozle families have invited their pootie and birdie neighbors and a few other species will also come in from the surrounding rural areas. But while the tents are being put up and the outdoor grills prepared below the fold we must pause and make sure that the Rulz are prominently posted per our arrangement with the Management:  THE RULZ  PWB Peeps posts two diaries a day for animal lovers: a daytime diary at 1:45 pm Eastern and a nightly open thread at 10 pm Eastern. We concoct silly stories share photos seek & give advice about pet health and behavior issues support each other in times of sadness and stress celebrate together when times are good and on most days have an inordinate amount of fun. You are welcome to join us! Be kind to one another we’re all in this together. Now on to the blog!     .     .  .       . .  .  ‘    .
