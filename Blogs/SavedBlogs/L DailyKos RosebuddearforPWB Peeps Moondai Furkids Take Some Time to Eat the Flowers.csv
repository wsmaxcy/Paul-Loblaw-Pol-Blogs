L, Moondai Furkids: Take Some Time to Eat the Flowers, RosebuddearforPWB Peeps, 2021-05-03,  Now that spring is actually really really (no really) here there comes an urge to surround oneself with flowers. Lots and lots and lots of flowers. And plants. Lots and lots of plants.  The boys naturally applaud these efforts on Mom’s part since flowers are fun. You can do many things with flowers and foliage.         Just remember that some flowers are toxic to your furbabies and keep those elsewhere.  African Violets are harmless and delicious as are pansies/violas and most ferns. Remember that kitty grass is your friend if your own hellions will not leave your plants alone. Marvin and Buzz are pretty good about that overall with occasional lapses.  For a real taste treat of course you can grow catnip in pots. Of course you will need constant rehabs for your dear ones.
