L, Third Mass Shooting In Two Weeks? Looks Like We're Getting Back To 'Normal', Susie Madrak, 2021-04-01, I guess this is what counts for "getting back to normal." We don't have any details but we all know the generic shooting story well enough to fill in the blanks. A man usually one with a history of domestic abuse was frustrated and upset about something and decided to show "them" (whichever "them" it is) they can't push him around. And thanks to the easy availability of handguns he got to express his feelings in a bloody classic way! Guess he showed us huh? Via the New York Times: ORANGE Calif. â€” Four people including a child were killed in a shooting at an office building in Southern California on Wednesday the authorities said bringing a deadly close to a month consumed by a series of high-profile cases of gun violence. The gunfire occurred around 5:30 p.m. in Orange Calif. about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles according to the police there who said a fifth victim a woman was hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound. A suspect was also hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound the authorities said. They added that it was not yet known if the wound was self-inflicted.
