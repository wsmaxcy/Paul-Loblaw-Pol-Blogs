L, Noxious Trumpers Lining Up To Pack GOP Senate Primaries, Kerry Eleveld, 03-26-21, Dawn is barely breaking on the 2022 election cycle and already Senate Republicans have a crew of  miscreants getting set to destroy what’s left of the Republican Party  as we once knew it not to mention the Senate.   Liberals likely don't have much love for retiring GOP senators  Roy Blunt of Missouri Richard Shelby of Alabama or Rob Portman of  Ohio but get a load of the qualifications of the people running to  replace them.          As The Washington Post points out Eric Greitens "resigned  the Missouri governorship in disgrace facing criminal charges and  allegations that an extramarital affair had turned violent.”   Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks essentially served as the hype  man at Donald Trump's so-called "Stop the Steal" rally on Jan. 6 that  preceded the deadly ransacking of the U.S. Capitol at the hands of a  rabid mob.    And Twitter temporarily suspended the account of former Ohio  state treasurer Josh Mandel after he targeted immigrants and migrant  children with slurs like "Muslim Terrorists" and "Mexican Gangbangers."   Courtesy of Donald Trump all three right-wingers are running  for their state's open Senate seat and stand a very good chance of  winning the GOP primary and potentially the general election.   Greitens put “defending Trump's America-first policies” front  and center at his announcement to run. Rep. Brooks broke his news while  standing alongside one of Trump's most racist xenophobic former White  House aides Stephen Miller. And in Ohio Mandel is running as a  tech-busting science-denying immigration hard-liner.   While red states like Alabama and Missouri might be out of  reach for Democrats swingier states with open seats like Ohio North  Carolina and Pennsylvania pose bigger risks for Republicans who hope  to net one seat in the midterms in order to reclaim the Senate majority.  Meanwhile the GOP's main pickup opportunities in Arizona and Georgia  could easily be squandered if more GOP Trumpers decide to make a go of  it.   That prospect has set Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell on an almost inevitable collision course. There's nothing in  the world McConnell wants more than to retake control of the upper  chamber. And there's almost nothing more in the world Trump wants than  to stick it to McConnell.    In fact in a Fox News podcast released this week Trump groused “We need better than Mitch McConnell."   Indeed we do—the nation deserves better. But Trump isn't sending his best people—or maybe he is and they're just tragically horrible.    The silver lining here is that Trump might ultimately manage to  stick it to McConnell while helping to keep the Democratic Senate  majority intact.   “You have candidates that want to keep re-litigating the past  instead of litigating what Democrats are doing now — that is a very  problematic approach for Republicans” said Jessica Taylor an analyst  for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.    History is on the side of Republicans gaining seats in a  midterm election where Democrats have unified control of government. But  Trump already has a proven record of defeat—costing the GOP control of  the House the Senate and the White House. Now Republicans are signed  up for yet another round of Trump's Midas touch and the roster is  already coming together nicely. Posted with permission from Daily Kos.
