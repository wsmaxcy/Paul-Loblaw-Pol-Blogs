L, CA:  Former MMA fighter and current Republican politician tries for unemployment while employed, m1i9k8t3j, 2021-05-03, Orange County Register: Huntington Beach Mayor Pro Tem Tito Ortiz filed for unemployment even as city checks kept coming  Public records show that Ortiz whose legal name is Jacob C. Ortiz sought unemployment benefits on Feb. 22 of this year. Naming the city as his employer he gave his first day of work as Dec. 7 2020 – when he was sworn in after comfortably winning his seat in the November election. He stated that his last day of work was Feb. 9 2021 although he still serves on the council. Huntington Beach Mayor Pro Tem Tito Ortiz Files For Unemployment While Currently Employed By The City  The city could end up having to pay if Ortiz gets a check from the Employment Development Department. “Ultimately if this claim was approved EDD will send us a bill to reimburse them for any costs. In that instance we’d certainly file an appeal” Chi said. Chi told KCAL9/CBS2 that under EDD rules as an elected official receiving pay and health insurance as Ortiz does he does not qualify for unemployment through the city. Tito Ortiz is what would be a prototypical Republican these days:  anti-masker COVID-denier “blue lives matter” Trump supporter.  Probably says he believes in “small government” and “pulling oneself up by the bootstraps”.  In this case he exemplifies another Republican trait:  hypocrite “do as I say not as I do”.  Maybe he needed more money to keep his lifestyle which includes a $4000000 house and two businesses.
