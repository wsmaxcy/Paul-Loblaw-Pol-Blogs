C, Hamas to Omar: Get Off Our Team!, John Hinderaker, 2021-06-12, We wrote here and here about Ilhan Omar’s latest outrage: tweeting that the United States Israel Afghanistan Hamas and the Taliban have all been guilty of “unthinkable atrocities.” All on a par apparently. Hamas though didn’t like being lumped with you me and Israel: Hamas issued press release denouncing US Rep. Illhan Omar (@Ilhan) for equating the 'Palestinian resistance' to the 'crimes' of Israel & US invasion in Afghanistan. They appreciate her stance on justice especially for Palestinians. But asks her to describe events 'accurately.' pic.twitter.com/gWO34xGQqx — Joe Truzman (@Jtruzmah) June 11 2021  
There is a certain dark comedy to all of this but I think the boys at Hamas can relax: I am pretty sure Ilhan didn’t really mean it. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
