L, Morning Open Thread - Friday is Freaking Fantastic., CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-04-30, There’s no need to adjust your settings.  It is Not Sunday (my normal hosting time).  Something out of place today does not mean it is bad or good.  Sometimes an out of place thing is just new. Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum.  Just like every day the diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please.      The first (and one of the rare times) I ever spoke in public  I was supposed to cover the hazards of working in the forest to a group of fifty men (a highly experienced labor force).  The group I was in front of were all members of the Lumbee Indian tribe of North Carolina and relatives of each other (by blood or marriage).  These guys were raised in rural areas worked outside everyday and I figured I was going to bore them to death.  What could I tell them that they didn’t already know?      Our company contract was with the Corp of Engineers and safety briefings were required by law.  As a junior executive (in charge of land surveying duties) that unwelcomed task fell on my shoulders.  I was given a list of topics that had to be covered each Monday morning.   There were fliers and handouts supplied by the Corp to assist in the presentations.  I read them all and even I got bored but that was what I had to present.  Here is what I did instead.       I stood before the group and held up the stack of papers.  I said “I am going to put these things on the bulletin board every Monday after our meetings.”  There was a moan from the men.  “Please look this stuff over before the day is out.  Here is what this information says.”  I paused and looked at the glazed over expressions then began the presentation.  “If you see a stick on the ground and it moves it is not a stick.  Don’t pick it up.  It may bite you.”  “If you get bit come see me for medical care and paperwork.  You will have to fill out the paperwork.”  “Sign the attendance log and be careful today.”      Those guys were silent until one chuckle then another plus a bonus smile from the foremen ended the meeting.  They left to do a good (and safe) job.  Every Monday for three months I gave a different speech that was direct and surprising (ie. “we don’t have enough water on site to put out a forest fire” or “we get to go home if it is raining but not if you get struck by lightening”).  I am proud to say there were no incident reports for that project.  They were the best group of workers in the world and I was glad they knew it and behaved accordingly.     If you have to give a speech know your audience.  They will appreciate the acknowledgment of their strengths and intelligence.   Teach what you know not what you think somewhat else does not.     I added this song because it is Friday and I am feeling freaking fabulous.  Chances are (as with many workers across this great nation) The Eagle Flies Today (translated; pay day - military slang).   So here we are and the meeting is over.  Be safe and well.
