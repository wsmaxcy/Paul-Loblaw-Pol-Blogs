C, Kamala Harris’ woke joke at the Naval Academy, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-05-29, Kamala Harris delivered the commencement address yesterday at the U.S. Naval Academy. In an attempt at woke humor Harris inserted feminism into her homage to green energy. She said: 
Just ask any Marine today would she rather carry 20 pounds of batteries or a rolled up solar panel and I am positive she will tell you a solar panel. And so would he.
 At least Harris limited herself to two genders.  This line was followed by the Harris laugh and tepid applause. According to  this account (which includes video) there were also groans from the crowd.  The Harris laugh doesn’t annoy me as much as it does some of her critics. However laughing at one’s own lines especially when they are this lame is not a good look. Harris’ punch line came after she informed electrical engineering graduates that they “will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power convert solar and wind energy into combat power.” On Twitter critics observed that solar panels generally still require batteries to store energy collected from sunlight. Fox News has the story  here. The comments are worth checking out. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
