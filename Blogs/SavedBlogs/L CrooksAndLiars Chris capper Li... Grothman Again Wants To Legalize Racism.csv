L, Grothman Again Wants To Legalize Racism, Chris capper Li..., 2021-05-19, Glenn Grothman issued a press release on Tuesday boasting about how he is once again reintroducing the Ending Sanctuary Cities Act.  The reason he is doing this is well documented and intuitive - he hates anyone who isn't a white straight man.  He sees it as a bonus that he also gets to take a potshot at Biden in the process. From the release (emphasis mine) “Our job is to keep Americans safe and our country secure and so-called sanctuary cities impede our ability to do just that” said Grothman. “Not enforcing our current immigration laws is a public safety issue. We need to hold states accountable for disobeying federal immigration laws and harboring criminal illegal aliens who sometimes turn out to be criminals.  “It is more important now than ever to reestablish control of our country’s immigration system. Since President Biden took office illegal border crossings have skyrocketed. The surge can be traced back to his politically motivated executive orders to stop construction of the border wall system canceling the agreement with Mexico to hold asylum seekers in Mexico as they await a trial and his squishy immigration rhetoric that has led some to believe our borders are open. Mmmm criminals who sometimes turn out to be criminals.  Who's have ever thunk it? And if that glaring lack of logic wasn't enough at the very end of his release he wants to make sure everyone knows that he is a moron: The term “criminal illegal alien” refers to non-citizens who are in the U.S. illegally and have prior criminal charges or convictions and not to illegal or undocumented immigrants as a whole. The bad news for Grothman is that US law already says it's illegal for "criminal illegal aliens" to be in the country.  The redundancy of this motion has now entered the absurd. He wants to introduce a law that is already in the books because criminals could be y'know criminals.   Doesn't he have a legislative aide that would catch these sort of things?   I only hope that this bill which isn't going to go anywhere again doesn't fly too low to be off of AOC's radar.  I would love to see her tear him up one side and down the other.  Grothman wouldn't stand a chance. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
