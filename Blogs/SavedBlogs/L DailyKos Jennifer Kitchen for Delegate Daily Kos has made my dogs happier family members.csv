L, Daily Kos has made my dogs happier family members, Jennifer Kitchen for Delegate, 2021-07-06, Because of the generosity of Daily Kos readers I get to spend a few days a week as a regular human being instead of a campaign “call time robot.” That means more time for my two kids more time for dogs Oliver and Tonks and more time talking to voters! I’m so grateful for all your support in our campaign to flip the first rural Virginia district blue in a generation.  Thanks again (from me AND Ollie)!
