L, Moondai Furkids: Monday's Child is Fair of Face, RosebuddearforPWB Peeps, 2021-04-19, Well last week I talked about Marvin my little devil’s advocate. This week I shall talk about my angel. I was going to try to make this funny and I realized I could not. I have almost no “mischief” pictures of Teddums as he was not the “mischievous” type.  If I had to describe my little angel in one word it would be “obliging”. Like so many orange kitties he was sweet unassuming and eager to please. He endured Marvin’s pestering with infinite patience rumbling with Marvin whenever he wanted it and being Mr. Sweet cuddlebunny when it was time for that. If you wanted him to sit on your lap he was up for that.  If you wanted him to pose for pictures he would oblige.  Alas he is gone over the Bridge now. If you love orange kitties be aware that they will always break your heart. They age faster and die sooner than other kitties if they live long enough they will all get kidney failure it appears to be a genetic health defect. My advice to anybody who falls in love with an orange kitty and adopts one is this: start them on the special kidney diet preferably the prescription diet if your vet will agree as soon as you get them when they are young. Taking the strain off their kidneys can help them live longer and more comfortably and I wish I had thought of it earlier with Teddums and with my previous orange kitty TBH. (Previous orange kitty Pookie lived to be 15 which is kind of an incredible age for an orangie. But the kidney failure got him in the end too.   All the pictures I have of Teddums look angelic. Even the way he captures the light looks angelic. The sunbeam seems to follow him around even if the rest of the room is dark.       Enough mawkish sentimentality.
