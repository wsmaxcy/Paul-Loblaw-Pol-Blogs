L, Presidential Historians Survey of Former Presidents, rightowrong, 2021-06-30, C-span just released a ranking survey of all the former presidents. At first glance this poll of historians seems somewhat surprising since it does not rank Trump the worst in history. This should change with time when the full extent of the damage he has done and will continue to do is calculated. If George W Bush could climb 7 places in 12 years Trump can and probably will fall 4 places in the not too distant future. This assumes of course that the fascist movement in the country is defeated and the historians are not faced with jail for publishing a survey like this with dear leader in the cellar.   https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=overall
