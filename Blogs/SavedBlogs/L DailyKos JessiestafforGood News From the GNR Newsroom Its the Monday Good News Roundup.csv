L, From the GNR Newsroom Its the Monday Good News Roundup, JessiestafforGood News, 2021-04-19, Hello and welcome back to the Monday Good News Roundup where we continue to chronicle all the good news to get you through the day as well as point and laugh at the downfall of Donald Trump.  I had a pretty wild weekend. I got my second COVID shot Thursday and on Friday night the aches and pains were so bad I had to call in sick to work the next day cause I got no sleep. Not so today though I’m feeling much better and I’m ready to deliver the good news. Special thanks to my partners Killer300 and Bhu who provided some of the stories you will be reading this morning.  At a retreat for well-heeled Republican donors this weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort Donald Trump went nuclear on some of his old pals still in Washington including Mitch McConnell. So yeah as expected Trump is not taking being a loser well and is blaming everyone except himself and as it turns out no one likes a whiner especially his donors.  This has been reflected in the polling on Biden too. Last month Gallup showed Biden with 96 percent support from Democrats — a figure higher than Republican support for Trump at any time during his presidency. This is not just an artifact of Gallup either. As the New York Times’s Lisa Lerer and Giovanni Russonello report “In separate polls released on Wednesday by Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University Mr. Biden’s approval was at 95 percent and 94 percent among members of his own party.”Weirdly Biden is better at being Trump than Trump ever was. He is catering to his base with big liberal policies. That is reflected in his polling which if anything is more stable and rock-solid than Trump’s Yeah as it turns out Biden is being an amazing leader and is doing a lot of good but we already knew all of that didn’t we?  There were close to 130 million adults in the country who received one shot roughly 50.4% of the over-18 population the agency reported. Fantastic news I’m more than confident this COVID mess will be over with very soon. Like not even 100 days in and Biden already has half of all Americans vaccinated.  Right now in the US students have an accumulated total of $1.71 trillion in loan debt making it second in consumer debt behind home mortgages. President Joe Biden made canceling $10000 of loan debt per student a part of his election campaign but members of Congress are pressing Biden to go bigger by forgiving $50000 per student. "America is facing a student loan time bomb" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said during a Senate hearing on April 13. The explosion she said "could throw millions of families over a financial cliff." I mean as someone who has a ton of unpaid student debt (Which I am currently not paying because I am on an IBR plan) I also really want that debt forgiven. Hopefully Biden will come through on this for us.  Designed to replace one of the most un-recycled materials on the planet the wrap consists of natural ingredients that are safe for the environment and humans. The research which was published in the Journal of Food Engineering describes three types of food films based on the well-known naturally occurring seaweed biopolymer sodium alginate—a compound found within the cell walls of brown algae. “Its molecules have film-forming properties” said Rammohan Aluru senior researcher at the organic synthesis laboratory at Ural Federal University and co-author of the paper. “The greatest advantage of sodium alginate is that it performs as liquid-gel in an aqueous medium.” I love living in the future. Hopefully this becomes a thing. I would love to finish eating something and then just eat the wrapper too.  Well that does it for this weeks roundup. Remember every day brings us closer to a brighter future where COVID is no more people are treated fairly and we actually do something about saving the earth. Keep your chin up and keep fighting.
