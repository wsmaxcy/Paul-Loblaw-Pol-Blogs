L, From the GNR Newsroom its the Monday Good News Roundup, JessiestafforGood News, 2021-06-28, Hey everyone and welcome back to the Monday Good News Roundup! Where Me and my team (consisting of Killer300 and Bhu) Bring you some salty sweet good news stories to perk up your day.  Its been a pretty big weekend for me personally it was my Birthday yesterday and I had a doctors appointment Friday. In the two years since I was last there I have lost some 40 pounds (Maybe more) and I discovered the source of the mysterious rash that has been plaguing me for months (Its a fungal infection) So I’m doing pretty well at the moment.  So without further ado lets get into the good news.  Save Lamu became known for the fierce fight it put up against the Kenyan government’s decision to build the coal plant. In the end the group went to court and won the case. The Environmental Tribunal issued an order stopping the construction of the coal plant and directed the government’s National Environmental Management Authority together with other stakeholders in the project to conduct an environmental impact assessment. But even as they fought to stop this something unprecedented happened. The community wanted to be compensated for the piece of land. “There were a lot of conflicts between the organization and the community because the community wanted money from the government and they knew it was good money because some had five or 10 acres and each acre went for a little over $15000” Famau said. Save Lamu stood their ground and told the government that they could compensate the farmers and generate electricity either with the tidal winds sun nuclear or wind power but not with coal. All Across the world people are fighting against those who are poisoning the land and once again big coal is the biggest loser.  In November’s general election meanwhile Biden won 47 percent of the non-college-educated vote according to an analysis of voter-file records from the data firm Catalist. That isn’t a majority but it’s no negligible fraction either. In absolute terms Biden received more votes from working-class Americans than he did from college-educated ones. And that holds true even within the white population: The president won more total ballots from white working-class voters than from white college graduates; he also won more votes from non-college-educated whites than he did from Black voters of all stripes. You wouldn’t know this from mainstream discourse. In sharp contrast to its post-Trump self-correction — in which outlets ordered countless insta-ethnographies of Trump’s postindustrial strongholds — the press has carried on ignoring Biden’s working-class base. Hey working class Biden voter here: STOP IGNORING ME.  Next year Kickstarter the 12-year-old crowdfunding platform will experiment with a four-day workweek a spokesperson for the company told The Atlantic. The unconventional move of reducing its employees’ hours without reducing their pay will be a valuable test of the theory that a shorter schedule can—on top of improving workers’ lives—be good or at least neutral for businesses’ bottom line. I already talked last week about how the four day workweek is a good thing. So here’s hoping this catches on outside of Kickstarter.  Last month a tiny hedge fund called Engine No. 1 staged a coup of sorts at ExxonMobil—a shareholders’ revolt that unseated three members of the oil company’s board of directors and replaced them with more climate-concerned candidates. The putsch was the first centered on climate change at an American oil company. Now the financial group is ready to recruit ordinary investors—people with 401(k)s Robinhooders the macroprudentially curious—into its army. Tomorrow it is launching an exchange-traded fund or ETF that will track the performance of the 500 largest public companies in America the firm told The Atlantic. People are tired of the world being destroyed by about a hundred assholes who are just obsessed with their own gain. And the public is sending them a message: Get out of our way or we’ll move you.  On Wednesday CNN reported that the gap between Trump and his daughter and son-in-law Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner “grows wider by the week.” The former president reportedly talks for hours on end about the “stolen” election and his hopeful return to politics. “A large part of the reason for the separation is Trump’s constant harping on the past and his inability to move on” wrote CNN. “The former President has also started to question the role that Kushner—one of the few people who were able to stay close to Trump throughout his two presidential campaigns and White House tenure—has played in his presidential legacy.” On Thursday former vice president Mike Pence defended his role in certifying the Electoral College on January 6 in what the New York Times called the “most forceful attempt yet to separate himself from his former boss.” Very slowly but surely everyone is abandoning the Trump Ship….even though its been at the bottom of the sea for half a year now.  And that does it for this week. We’ll see you next Monday with more good news until then have a pleasant morning.
