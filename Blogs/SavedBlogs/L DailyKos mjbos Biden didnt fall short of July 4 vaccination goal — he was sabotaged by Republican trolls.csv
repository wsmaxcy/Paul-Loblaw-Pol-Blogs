"Biden misses July 4 vaccine target as nation's 'independence' from virus remains elusive" echoed a similar headline at ABC News. "Biden heralds U.S. emergence from the pandemic but he risks celebrating too soon" warns a headline at the Washington Post. The media has completely ignored the fact that the shortfall has been based on Republican strategy looking to make Biden look bad. When there are 20 States meeting or exceeding the goal and all are BLUE does not take a rocket scientist to figure out what is going on. Only know are a handful of Republican governors beginning to see that this strategy is hurting business in their states and with the Delta variant it could be worse. Hutchinson in Arkansas and Justice in West Virginia being two of them. Beyond time for Big Business and US Chamber of Commerce to get involved as well. Business owners looking harder on where to build new facilities. Public health of its employees has become a bigger priority after living through a pandemic. States playing politics with public health will start to pay a price.
