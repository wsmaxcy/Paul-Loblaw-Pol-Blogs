L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing  April 25 2021, side pocketforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-04-25,  Without a Doubt we’re in a Drought.  News headlines about drought in the West can seem a bit like a broken record with some scientists saying the region is on the precipice of permanent drought. That's because in 2000 the Western U.S. entered the beginning of what scientists call a megadrought — the second worst in 1200 years — triggered by a combination of a natural dry cycle and human-caused climate change. California where I live is particularly hard hit.  Guardian    (Daniel Swain writes the essential California Weather Blog which is frightening today.) “It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year it’s that this is our second extremely dry year in a row” said Daniel Swain a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California – along with much of the US west – is parched Swain added and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires. The water levels in our county’s lakes and reservoirs are very low and some will go dry this year exposing silt. A LTE today had a wise suggestion: use that opportunity to dredge out the silt for future water storage. This demonstrates optimism that it will rain in the future. But this hope is not borne out by predictions which are universally negative. Sonoma and Mendocino counties are in drought emergencies soon to be made official and restrictions will be forthcoming.  Many folks around here especially in rural areas depend on wells. More and more of them are failing. One can drill deeper but the cost is very high. My well drilled 25 years ago cost $18 per foot; I’m sure it’s more now. And statewide aquifers have been overdrawn to the point of land collapse known as “subsidence”.  Aquifers depend on rainfall to recharge and we have little of that. Three quarters of California’s water use is for agriculture. Many large agricultural areas have water rights which guarantees them water and they have incredible political clout. This year may modify some of these rights. The best information on this is the book Cadillac Desert which foresaw this in 1986. California agriculture supplies so much of America’s food so much of the water use is appropriate. But not all.  From Bountiful: We should all agree that almonds like all other crops use water (1 to 3 gallons per one almond plus shell and hull to be exact). Almonds are permanent crops with large upfront costs. Therefore planting almonds locks in future water demand which could create more contention between other stakeholders. And lastly 80% of the world’s almonds are grown in California with the majority of them destined for export. Locally we have been conserving water for years after experiencing mini-droughts for years. Folks are encouraged to tear out lawns and install drought-resistant plants or stones. Car washing should be at commercial car washes which recycle water. Clear driveways and patios with a broom not a hose. Flush only when necessary. Save the water from the faucet which waiting for hot water and use it on outdoor plants. Collect rainwater in barrels for watering. One American assumption (and obsession) is the concept of taking a shower every day!  Advice in today’s paper is to limit your daily shower to only 5 or 6 minutes. A low flow shower head can deliver one or two gallons a minute and some are excellent. Also too “Put simply there is almost nothing more enjoyable than taking a luxurious shower after a long day. Regardless of gender nationality or political preference we ALL want the same basic things from our showers: clean water adequate pressure and the perfect temperature.” “Showering is one of the leading ways we use water in the home accounting for nearly 17 percent of residential indoor use according to the Environmental Protection Agency”.  YMMV just sayin. It was only a year ago I wrote a KTK called Water in which I described some of our water sources and checked if readers knew theirs. At that time I was confident that we would have sufficient rain and drought worries would be only a memory. Not to be. We are expecting another summer of dangerous wildfires. Some have already occurred. The drought has exacerbated  the potential and water will be required to control them Where will it come from? How are y’all faring with water? Too much not enough or just right. Do you practice water conservation methods? Does your water district encourage conservation?  I know this is a dire situation for us and worldwide. So let’s make this an open thread where happy thoughts are welcomed. Also I know about the Oscars so no-one will be here anyway perhaps.
