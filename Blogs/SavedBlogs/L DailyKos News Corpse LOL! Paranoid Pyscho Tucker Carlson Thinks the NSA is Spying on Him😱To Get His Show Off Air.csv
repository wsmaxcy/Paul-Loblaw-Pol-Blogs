L, LOL! Paranoid Pyscho Tucker Carlson Thinks the NSA is Spying on HimðŸ˜±To Get His Show Off Air, News Corpse, 2021-06-29, Just when you thought that the conspiracy theory crackpots of the world had hit rock bottom Tucker Carlson comes along and blasts through to previously unimaginable new lows. And with his latest lapse into lunacy he has secured for himself the title of uncontested heavyweight Freakazoid of Fox News. On Monday's episode of Carlson's White Power Hour he disclosed the alleged existence of a clandestine plot to banish him from television. The architects of this evil according to Carlson are undercover operatives of the National Security Agency (NSA). Carlson unleashed this unhinged horror story with his trademarked scowl and furrowed brow (video below): That is indeed "a shocking claim." But only because of how preposterous it is. Despite Carlson's evidence-free insistence that it all happened it makes no sense whatsoever. Carlson's ego is in hyperdrive if he thinks that the NSA would waste any time trying to get his lame show canceled. And before you believe any of Carlson's hysterics bear in mind that he is a notorious liar. He was defended in a defamation case by his own Fox News lawyers who successfully argued that "given Mr. Carlsonâ€™s reputation any reasonable viewer â€˜arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticismâ€™ about the statements he makes." In other words Carlson's reputation sucks and no reasonable person would believe anything he says. With that in mind Carlson continued... First of all if the NSA were spying on Carlson they would have to have had warrants to do so. That would indicate that either Carlson or the person(s) he was communicating with was a foreign agent or other national security threat. Which isn't much of a stretch considering how he has aided and abetted Russian propaganda. Furthermore if an NSA agent disclosed an active investigation to a target of the investigation that isn't whistleblowing. It's a felony. More to the point Carlson's ludicrous "factual" declaration that he has "confirmed" that the Biden Administration is spying on him is laughable. The notion that the information Tucker says could only have come from NSA "captured" texts and emails is just plain stupid. It could also have come from any of those he was texting and emailing. Or it could have come from a hacker such as the Russians who are so enamored of Tucker and his anti-American propaganda. That would fit in perfectly with their efforts to foment fear and distrust of the U.S. government. But Carlson still wasn't through... It's cute that Carlson refers to himself as a "journalist." However in all probability this is just a totally manufactured and pitiful attempt on Carlson's part to deflect from the avalanche of criticism he's received from a recent spate of ridiculous and even brazenly unpatriotic rants. For instance He has taken incoming from... After that sort of maniacal misbehavior Carlson surely needs some distractions to take the heat off. But inventing paranoid plots against him by the NSA seems like a strange strategy to get people to pay less attention to his mental breakdowns. And one has to wonder what his bosses at Fox News think of his rapidly deteriorating cerebral malfunction. Although knowing Fox they may just be considering giving him a raise.
