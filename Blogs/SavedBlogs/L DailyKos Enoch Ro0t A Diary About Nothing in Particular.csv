L, A Diary About Nothing in Particular, Enoch Ro0t, 2021-06-27, Today’s diary is just  sort of a mish-mash of a few things that I’ve been up to lately.  First up is the title image.  This is my 3D model of an actual bench plane you can buy right now from an outfit called Bridge City Tool Works.   All of their tools are drop-dead gorgeous.  And they are priced accordingly; this bench plane retails for $695.  This digital version is likely the closest I’ll ever get to possessing one. Speaking of in-person I met up with fellow Kossack cracktactor a week or two ago.  He happened to be in Michigan and was able to fit an afternoon visit into his travels.  How cool is that?  Some may recall cracktactor as the donor of the vintage heavy duty jig saw featured in this diary from earlier this year.  He got the the full VIP treatment  — A shop tour and a ride around the lakes in the ‘72 Ford.  No beer or weed though; he still had some driving to do.  Next time..  Our visit was all too brief and dammit we never thought to record the event for history with a photo.  But before he resumed his travels I gave him the bench plane in the photo to the right to take back home.  Official new policy:  Any Kossacks who set foot in my shop will not leave without a commemorative hand plane. There must be 30 or 40 of the things out there..  Mrs. R. approves. Anyway it was so cool to meet up with cracktactor — A genuinely good guy with lots of interesting life stories.  Come back again soon — We always have beer!  A few days later I was driving back from town and spotted this Craftsman radial arm saw by the road with a for sale sign.  Holy crap!  I had to check this out.  It was only $100 everything is there and works and the guy even loaded it in his truck and delivered it.  I wasn’t actively looking for one of these but this was a deal I literally couldn’t pass up.  I’ve made a few test cuts and it performs like new.  And I still have all of my fingers.  Reading the owner’s manual before using is highly recommended.. Continuing with the toothed cutting tool theme here’s another impulse purchase at the other end of the saw technology spectrum — A 1920’s Henry Disston & Sons 10” backsaw that has never been used.  It doesn’t show up all that well in the photo but the original rust protective grease from the factory is still undisturbed.  The teeth are razor-sharp and the apple wood handle is pristine.  I paid more for this than I did for the Craftsman and I can’t ever use it without destroying it’s value.  But I absolutely love it. I still needed (OK wanted) a little back saw.  I decided to go with a new Lie-Nielson.  I’ve seen a lot of positive reviews for Lie-Nielson products and figured I’d try out one of their more affordable tools.  And they’re made right here in the USA! It has to be the best hand saw I’ve ever used.  It comes out of the box sharpened tuned and ready to go.  The birdseye maple handle is beautifully made and feels perfect in your hand.  Making straight clean cuts is a breeze.  It’s worth every penny of its roughly $140 price tag.  Which is still more than I paid for that Craftsman.. Now here’s some craftsmanship of a different sort.  My mom loved to cross stitch and she made this for my dad’s workshop way back in the 90s.  It was on the wall there for years.  It’s been in storage for the past twenty years or so and I finally dug it out from the box.  Dad was a heavy smoker and the fabric was literally sticky with nicotine residue and it smelled horrible.  Why did we ever think smoking cigarettes was a good idea anyway?   Soaking it in dish soap and water and some gentle scrubbing cleaned it up nicely.  I’ll re-frame it and find a prominent place in my shop for it.  Mom and Dad would approve I think. On a real-world political note I’ve been watching the infrastructure ‘negotiations’ with some interest.  I’m sorry but the Republicans will never negotiate in good faith on anything substantial.  They will pretend to try reaching a ‘bipartisan’ compromise and crow about it all over cable news.  But in the end they’ll delay delay delay and finally come up with some made-up reasons to say no.  Real bipartisanship would be good but McConnell will never allow anything to pass the Senate that creates the public perception of a Biden Administration accomplishment as long as the filibuster exists in its current form.  I hope Joe and the Democrats get this.  I’d like to see them kill or amend the filibuster as needed and enact bold sweeping legislation over the next year and a half that makes immediate and major improvements to regular folks’ lives.  Things like a livable minimum wage pre-K and permanent child care tax credit payments every month.  Add in prescription drug pricing reform moves toward affordable health care college tuition subsidies for those who qualify academically and student loan forgiveness and reform.  All this and more while passing strong voting rights and climate/infrastructure bills.  While they’re at it it would be nice if billionaires started paying taxes at rates at least proportional to what most of us pay.  Will any of this happen?  Probably not but hey a radical socialist liberal can dream..
