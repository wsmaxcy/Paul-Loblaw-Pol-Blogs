L, Top Comments: North American Heat Wave Edition, brilligforTop Comments, 2021-06-28, Before I start I want to say to gizmo because I fell asleep early and missed his Sunday diary: “We currently have 30 boxes of ‘must-keep’ books stacked in our foyer while we fix the guest room/library floor. This is after donating at least 30 boxes. I dread when we someday downsize.”   I just got off the phone with K1 who is discovering that summer in Rochester NY is not as cold and snowy as the rest of the year would lead one to believe. It’s 85F at 8pm both there and here and while she’s expecting a break in the oppressive heat tomorrow we’ve got a few more days in store here in the Boston area. As hot as it is here it pales in comparison to what the Pacific Northwest is seeing. As I type it’s 121F in Death Valley… and a record-setting 104F in SEATTLE. 110F in Portland (Oregon a mere 85F as the sun sets in that OTHER Portland). Heck it’s only 83F in Cancun.  Because the Pacific Northwest doesn’t usually experience scorchingly hot temperatures the number of houses with air conditioning is low. Here in the Boston area almost everyone I know who doesn’t have central air has at least ONE room with an AC unit in a window providing respite from the heat and humidity. Casa Brillig is lucky to have central air (especially since Mr. Brillig’s office since Feb 2020 is in our third floor attic) and we’re mindful to keep it set at 80F because really we don’t need to put on a sweater inside during a heatwave. We’re also keeping our use of electricity low during the day even though we’ve got solar panels providing much of our power because if we all conserve during the day as much as possible we won’t stress the power grid quite so much. K1 is experiencing her first summer away from home and thus away from an AC unit. She’s learning lots of tricks that those of us who grew up in the era before AC was common know: opening and closing shades depending on time of day/position of sun safely draping a fan with a cool cloth etc. How is the weather where you are? How are you holding up? What are your tips tricks and strategies to pass along to others struggling in the heat?

Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down. Please remember that comment inclusion in Top Comments does not constitute support or endorsement by diarist formatter Top Comments writers or DailyKos. Questions complaints or comments? Contact brillig. From Puddytat: Although it's likely too late to rec by the time TC publishes I'd like to nominate this comment from Tara TASW. It's a series of tweets she found but I've been thinking about the one by Unconsenting Uke which features an analogy (correct usage??) that might be instructive to use to educate others about why racism needs to be fixed even by those not responsible for it. In any event the fact that I'm still thinking about it this morning after reading it last night makes it a Top Comment in my book. From yours truly Brillig: Joan McCarter had a great diary on Toyota's funding of Insurrectionist members of Congress. I thought Larks Tongues In Aspic’s comment was entirely accurate.  We also had a highlight: doinaheckuvanutjob highlighted this comment by flycaster in Aldous J Pennyfarthing’s Sunday diary Here's the only clip you need to see from last night's Loser-palooza.
