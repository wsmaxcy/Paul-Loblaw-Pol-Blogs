L, George Floyd Statue In Brooklyn Vandalized With White Supremacist Group's Name, Christopher Mathias, 2021-06-24, A statue of George Floyd unveiled only five days ago in Brooklyn New York to commemorate Juneteenth was vandalized early Thursday morning police and the statue’s creators confirmed.  Black paint was thrown onto the bust of Floyd which had been placed in Flatbush Junction near Brooklyn College and white stenciled graffiti spelling out the URL of a fascist group’s website was spray-painted on the base of the statue memorializing the 46-year-old Black man who was killed by police in Minneapolis on May 25 2020.  A spokesperson for the New York Police Department said officers discovered the vandalism early Thursday. “There are no arrests and the investigation is ongoing” the spokesperson said in a statement.  The NYPD Hate Crimes task force tweeted it was investigating the incident. Lindsay Eshelman — co-founder of ConfrontART which partnered with the We Are Floyd Foundation started by Floyd’s brother Terence Floyd to erect the statue — said police told her the vandalism likely occurred between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Thursday the two-hour window when officers were not stationed near the statue.  Eshelman who talked to HuffPost by phone Thursday while helping repaint the statue said she was “devastated” to learn of the vandalism.  But she also offered a defiant message for the vandals: “You’re cowards. You did this at night when no one could see you. I’m restoring it in the day when everybody can see your hate.”  Terence Floyd who attended the statue’s unveiling heard about the vandalism just as his flight landed Thursday morning in Minneapolis. On Friday he’ll sit in a courtroom to watch as the police officer who murdered his brother is sentenced possibly to decades in prison.  The vandalism Floyd told HuffPost in a statement “is a perfect example of why we are so diligent in promoting change. As a community we should stand together in peace and in turmoil.”  Farah Louis the New York City councilwoman who represents the area where the statue is located tweeted that the vandalism was “a hate crime and totally unacceptable to the memory of Mr. Floyd and to the Black community.” Mayor Bill de Blasio also tweeted: “Last night a far-right extremist group vandalized a statue of George Floyd in Brooklyn. A racist loathsome despicable act of hate. The City Cleanup Corps is repairing the statue right now and a hate crime investigation is underway. We will bring these cowards to justice.” Last night a far-right extremist group vandalized a statue of George Floyd in Brooklyn. A racist loathsome despicable act of hate.

Thus this abhorrent hateful defacement of the George Floyd statue is more of the same garbage.” Patriot Front which didn’t return a HuffPost request for comment hasn’t taken responsibility for the vandalism in Brooklyn.  The 6-foot sculpture of Floyd whose murder sparked a wave of anti-racist uprisings across America last year was unveiled on Juneteenth a newly recognized federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S.  “It’s a major statement for a major person” Terence Floyd told NBC at the unveiling of artist Chris Carnabuci’s sculpture. “To see Brooklyn represent him and honor him on a national holiday it’s all love.”
