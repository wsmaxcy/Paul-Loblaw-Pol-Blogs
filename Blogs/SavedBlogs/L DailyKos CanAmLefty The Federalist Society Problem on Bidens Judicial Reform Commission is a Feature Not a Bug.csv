L, The "Federalist Society Problem" on Biden's Judicial Reform Commission is a Feature Not a Bug, CanAmLefty, 2021-05-11, A diary posted earlier today contends that President Joe Biden’s Judicial Reform Commission has a “problem” with its composition specifically the presence of four Federalist Society members but the problem is much bigger and runs much deeper than that. In fact two articles published last month make a strong case that the Commission is designed to do nothing but kick the can down the road.  Article No. 1 Biden’s Supreme Court Reform Commission Shows He Doesn’t Really Want Court Reform: He’s not even asking for recommendations! by Mark Joseph Stern. Slate 4/9/2021.  Stern who earned a law degree at Georgetown Law School in 2016 has also published a book American Justice 2019: The Roberts Court Arrives  Stern opens with an uncontroversial observation about the Commission’s origins: “Biden devised this approach [of appointing a Commission] on the campaign trail to avoid taking a position on court expansion—a move that frustrated staunch advocates of reform but smartly defused the question as an election issue.” But then he points out an “odd” limitation on the Commission’s work:  Oddly however the president has not asked the commission that he has now formed to give him any actual recommendations on the extremely pertinent question of how to deal with a judiciary that Republicans have captured through unprecedented partisan obstruction. Instead he asked his commission to produce a report analyzing the history and legality of proposed Supreme Court reforms as well as the “principal arguments” for and against these proposals which he will then use to chart a course forward. Whatever of the merits of this strategy as an intellectual or political exercise it is not a recipe for real Supreme Court reform.  Stern then argues that the limits on the Commission’s task and the character of its membership constitute evidence that it is not intended to provide support for reform but to avoid the issue entirely.  The first red flag here is the commission’s task: not to produce action items or recommendations but to study issues that have already been studied to death.  The “second red flag” according to Stern is “the commission’s membership” which though many of them are “undoubtedly progressive ... are also the upper tier of the legal elite.” Stern quotes with approval a statement issued by Congressman Mondaire Jones who argued that “many Americans will rightly be skeptical of a commission composed almost entirely of people protected from the real-life consequences of the Supreme Court’s right-wing extremism.”  But even worse than who is included on the Commission is who is excluded:   the commission is conspicuously missing the leading advocates of court expansion on the left. ... [T]he members of Biden’s commission while undoubtedly talented have not delved into the nuts of bolts of court reform and emerged with practical solutions. ... As far as I can tell not a single member of the commission appears to have stuck their neck out by publicly endorsing real specific court reform. This is not necessarily a knock against them but it is a sign that the president avoided academics who are in the trenches of this battle.  Stern mentions several academics including Samuel Moyn Steve Vladeck Stephany Rose Spaulding and Carol Anderson who support Court expansion but were excluded from the Commission. He also observes that while these known expansion supporters were excluded several known opponents were included such as Jack Goldsmith Adam White and Thomas Griffith. Stern concludes:  Looking at the membership and goals of this commission it seems obvious that Biden does not really want to pursue court reform. Rather he appears eager to scrape the issue off his plate by tossing it to (and I say this lovingly) a bunch of eggheads who have spent their careers marinating in the fantasy that the Supreme Court is apolitical.  Article No. 2 Biden’s Supreme Court reform commission won’t fix anything: The president’s new commission has a lot of fans — in the Federalist Society. By Ian Millhiser Vox 4/10/2021.  Milhiser who earned a JD at Duke Law School in 2006 clerked for Judge Eric L. Clay of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has published a related book: Injustices: The Supreme Court's History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted Milhiser starts where Stern left off pointing out that “none of the leading academic proponents of Supreme Court reform were appointed” to the Commission. Milhiser wonders if the purpose of the Commission was not to reassure progressives but to reassure conservatives:  When the White House released the list of commission members on Friday it swiftly won praise — from members of the conservative Federalist Society. Evan Bernick a right-libertarian law professor at Georgetown praised the commission as a “powerhouse lineup of scholars.” Stephen Sachs a Duke Law professor who won the Federalist Society’s Joseph Story Award in 2020 called the commission “an astonishingly well-balanced list.” Ilya Somin a libertarian law professor at George Mason University wrote shortly after the commission’s membership was announced that “the composition of the Commission is also bad news for advocates of court-packing who may have hoped that it will produce a report endorsing the idea.” So if the White House’s goal was to allay concerns among conservatives that President Biden might try to diminish the Republican Party’s influence over the judiciary this commission appears to have accomplished that goal.  Milhiser also echoes Stern’s observations about Court reform proponents who were excluded from the Commission adding a few more names to the list:  But the commission does not include law professors Daniel Epps and Ganesh Sitaraman authors of a highly influential proposal to expand the Supreme Court to 15 justices and have the key members of the Court be chosen in a bipartisan process that is intended to make the Court less ideological. And it does not include Aaron Belkin a political science professor and leader of Take Back the Court a pro-reform organization. In choosing the members of this commission the White House appears to have prioritized bipartisanship and star power within the legal academy over choosing people who have actually spent a meaningful amount of time advocating for Supreme Court reforms. (emphasis added.) Milhiser also adds an important observation about how the mere threat of Court-packing could impact the politics of the Supreme Court:  [T]he mere threat of court-packing can serve an important function. If the justices believe that President Biden may send them six new colleagues if the Court dismantles what remains of the Voting Rights Act then those justices may be less likely to dismantle the Voting Rights Act. A healthy fear of a Democratic majority could lead the Supreme Court to become less partisan. But Biden’s new commission sends the opposite message. With so many prominent members of the Federalist Society praising the commission right out the gate it’s clear that conservatives do not feel threatened by this commission. And the justices themselves are just as capable of looking at the list of names that Biden picked and seeing that this commission is unlikely to support significant reforms. Although he does not mention it Milhiser’s argument is buttressed as well by historical experience: when the Supreme Court reversed itself in 1937 by finally abandoning Lochner-era jurisprudence and allowing New Deal type laws to stand it did so knowing that FDR was seriously considering packing the Court.  To conclude I think the inclusion of Federalist Society folks is problematic but the exclusion of any court reform proponents—which had to be deliberate—is a large bright flashing neon sign that this Commission will get us nowhere on Court reform. That is not a bug it is a feature.
