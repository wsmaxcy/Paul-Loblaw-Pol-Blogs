A few minutes before 7 p.m. about a dozen protesters marched from the park in Court Square to Graham Soda Shop and Grill a restaurant across from the courthouse owned by Jennifer Talley a member of the city council. Inside they sat and sang “Amazing Grace” to protest her support of the anti-protest ordinance. An ordinance that makes it illegal to gather more than 10 people for a protest without obtaining a permit from notorious Sheriff Terry Johnson. Once the 11th person walks up arrests can immediately follow. Of course the first protesters to be ejected from her restaurant were African-American. Such blatant overt racism by a business owner is rare even in these fraught times. But the fact Talley is also an elected official makes this ten times worse. She should be forced to resign by her fellow Council members but they won't do a damn thing. Carli Brosseau Charlotte Observer — APRIL 29 2021 Despite a strict new protest ordinance Black Lives Matter demonstrators have resumed near-daily protests in Graham. On Wednesday evening about 60 people gathered in the Alamance County town’s Court Square to call for justice in the name of Andrew Brown the Black man recently shot and killed by sheriff’s deputies in Elizabeth City. They also want the prompt release of the related video and for action on local racial justice priorities such as the removal of a Confederate monument and the repeal of the town’s protest ordinance which requires demonstrators to notify police in advance of most events. A few minutes before 7 p.m. about a dozen protesters marched from the park in Court Square to Graham Soda Shop and Grill a restaurant across from the courthouse owned by Jennifer Talley a member of the city council. Inside they sat and sang “Amazing Grace” to protest her support of the anti-protest ordinance.  Talley asked protesters and journalists not to record inside the restaurant and asked them to leave though some had ordered drinks and were prepared to order food. She then left the restaurant and returned with police. Officers approached the three Black men in the group one by one and asked apologetically that they leave at Talley’s request. Not everyone was individually asked to leave. “Jennifer I can’t eat here?” Maurice Wells Jr. called out when he was specifically asked. “You say you welcome me to your town but you won’t allow me to eat here? Because I’m Black!” The group left the restaurant after officers began asking protesters to show their IDs. No one was arrested. On Tuesday evening police arrested and charged them with violating the protest ordinance and failure to disperse. WRAL April 28 2021  The Sheriff in Pasquotank County says he wants the April 21 body cam video taken by his deputies released. The Elizabeth City Council voted to get the video released. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein and Gov. Roy Cooper want it released. In the week since Pasquotank County sheriff’s deputies shot and killed Andrew Brown Jr. during an attempted arrest turmoil and unrest have elevated amid calls for release of the video that might answer some of the questions and quiet some of the growing suspicions surrounding the shooting death of Brown as deputies attempted to apprehend him on a drug warrant. Tuesday the FBI announced it was launching a civil rights investigation related to the shooting. Also yesterday Gov. Roy Cooper called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to handle the matter so as to “assure the community and Mr. Brown’s family that a decision on pursuing criminal charges is conducted without bias.” Release of the video has become part of a protracted legal morass mostly due to a 2016 law that specifically designated the recordings as “not public records.” Curiously the ban on release of such videos was packed in legislation that also authorized hypodermic needle exchange programs to help deal with narcotics addiction public health challenges. Danielle Bottaglia News&Observer  — APRIL 28 2021 Senators walked back a proposed bill that would ban child marriages in North Carolina but amended it to match the state’s laws on statutory rape. Senate Bill 35 in its original form would have banned anyone under 18 from marrying. “When we first filed this bill one of the things we were looking at is the fact that North Carolina has become a destination place for marriage — for folks who are marrying children and for sex trafficking” Sen. Danny Britt said. “What we wanted to do was come up with a bill that would take us off that list and protect these children.” But on Wednesday afternoon Britt a Lumberton Republican brought an amendment forward that undid the majority of that bill. North Carolina is one of two states Alaska being the other that allows children as young as 14 to marry. Under Britt’s amendment children as young as 14 can still marry but only someone four years older or less. The marriage would need to be approved by a parent or guardian with written notice given to the clerk of court unless the minor is emancipated. The bill would also allow children over 14 who become pregnant or have a child to marry the father. A judge must rule however that the marriage is in the best interest of the children. Laura Olsen North Carolina Policy Watch — 4/27/2021 WASHINGTON — After months of delays the U.S. Census Bureau on Monday started to distribute data that will be needed to redraw their U.S. House boundaries: an updated tally of how many people live within their borders and the number of House districts that each state will have for the next decade. The Census Bureau released the apportionment data which captured the counts of state-level populations used to make sure that the number of House seats is proportional to each state’s population. Population growth in North Carolina gives the state a 14th House seat and another electoral vote for the 2024 and 2028 general elections the census count shows. The official count of 10439388 North Carolina residents and an additional 14560 living overseas brought the state’s apportionment population to 10453948 in 2020. Only military and diplomatic personnel and their families were counted overseas. That means each of the 14 House members representing North Carolina would represent 746711 North Carolinians both in-state and overseas on average. North Carolina’s resident population grew by 903905 from 9535483 in 2010 or 9.5% whereas the apportionment population grew by 9.2% with a decrease in overseas population counted in April of 2020 when the census was conducted. For six states the long-awaited census results mean they’ll gain representation in Congress: Fast-growing Texas will add two seats and five states will each add one seat: Florida (which surpassed New York to become the third-largest state) North Carolina Colorado Montana and Oregon. Not until Minute 100 of a 120-minute confirmation hearing for Secretary of the Environment nominee Dionne Delli-Gatti did any lawmaker speak the words “environmental justice.” Even then the context for the comment was not one of concern for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods who are disproportionately burdened by polluting industries. Instead Sen. Norm Sanderson (R-Carteret Craven and Pamlico) asked Delli-Gatti how she defined the term. “It’s so broad it can touch about every [environmental] permit” Sanderson said. That indeed is the point of environmental justice.  Delli-Gatti apparently learned the art of diplomacy from her time as a congressional liaison for the EPA Region 4 office and as director of Southeast Climate and Energy at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s the consideration that no specific group based on race or economics or other distinguishing characteristics can be disproportionately impacted” she said. “We can’t intentionally or unintentionally burden a specific sector of the population. It can be challenging because there aren’t clear pathways in our laws about how we consider environmental justice. But under Title VI we have to consider it.” In other words Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is not just a good idea. It’s the law.  The Senate Agriculture Energy and Environment Committee on Tuesday grilled Delli-Gatti nominated to the post by the governor more aggressively than her predecessor Michael Regan who recently became U.S. EPA administrator. Her hearing which after two hours was continued to another day felt like rugby. By comparison Regan’s hour-long hearing in 2017 was a beer league softball game.  Thanks for reading!
