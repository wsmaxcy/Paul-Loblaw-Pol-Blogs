L, New Doodle in the Works., A Pagan in Arizona, 2021-04-22, Ordinarily I take a break between projects- anywhere from a couple of weeks to as long as a year. This time however I felt the urge to play some more right away.Â  My friends who've seen this have mentioned cookies cupcakes planets and a redheaded stepchild as their personal interpretations. (don't tell them but they're all wrong) ETA and "maltesers" which normal people call malt balls or malted milk balls. Because Daphne Whitethigh has threatened to harrumph at me. ðŸ™„ ðŸ˜± I've also been seeking advice and investigatingÂ  platforms for possibly selling prints of my works. If anyone here has any recommendations for me I'd be interested in hearing about them. TYIA.  Today I'm adding teal turquoise and rose gold.
