C, Author: There Is a Solution to COVID-19 But Government Won’t Tell You, The Heartland Institute, 2021-03-19, Review of Pandemic Blunder: Fauci and Public Health Blocked Early Home COVID Treatment Outskirts Press 2021 By Joel S. Hirschhorn $17.95 106 pages When the history books are written on “the great pandemic of 2020” they will likely focus on one theme: how powerful government agencies and special interests used a virus to dupe the American people for political and self-promoting agendas. This is not to diminish the fact that COVID-19 has been deadly. With 500000 lives lost it is. But the leaders entrusted to protect the nation could have greatly reduced this pain and suffering and failed to do so.  Was it incompetence or malfeasance? That is the question Joel Hirschhorn seeks to answer in his excellent and timely summary of events titled Pandemic Blunder: Fauci and Public Health Blocked Early Home COVID Treatment. Upon finishing readers will wonder if Hirschhorn was too kind in the use of the word “blunder.” What he describes is far more outrageous a conspiracy really the action of plotting to do something unlawful or harmful. Hirschhorn makes the case that COVID-19 could have been a manageable disease. Tens of thousands of people could have been kelp alive had government agencies supported affordable safe and existing drugs to treat the infection at home during its early stages – before the contagion replicates and does its deadly damage. There are numerous observational and “real-life data” studies showing the effectiveness of early treatment for COVID-19. Had this information seen the light of day in the mainstream media or not been censored on social media or discredited by powerful government bureaucrats and the medical establishment including a fake study now retracted by two of the world’s top “peer-reviewed” medical journals maybe the public would not have panicked to the point of surrendering their most basic civil liberties. The Pillars of Control Pandemic Blunder documents a great deal of scientific information on early COVID-19 treatments and presents it in a way understandable to a general audience. The book begins with a description of what many public health experts but most notably Peter McCullough M.D. have described as the four pillars to controlling a pandemic. One pillar is contagion control which the United States and countries around the globe have done with abandon. This would include lockdowns social distancing orders disinfection of surfaces mask mandates crowd control and the like. Government agencies have been very effective in getting the public to comply with these measures but tragically these steps have done little to reduce caseloads and deaths. By spring it became apparent the most vulnerable individuals to the virus were the elderly especially those in group homes.  Nine months after many of these measures were in place however elderly patients in nursing homes topped the charts for COVID-19 mortality. A second pillar has been hospitalization. The current guidance from the nation’s health agencies has been to do nothing for infection outside of comfort care until symptoms become worse. Once in the hospital the prospects for survival plummet and the costs soar. Hirschhorn describes how the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has poured much effort into fast-tracking treatments like Remdesivir an experimental treatment that can only be administered in a hospital at a cost of thousands of dollars a dose. The government has also poured billions of dollars into pillar number three vaccines. Vaccines are always a gamble. Safe and effective vaccines can take years to develop and oftentimes contagions fade away after herd immunity is established naturally. Additionally viruses mutate making prevention that much more difficult to target. Think the flu vaccine. The Common Sense Pillar Lastly there is the approach used for nearly every disease you could find in a Merck manual including the flu – early outpatient treatment. But for reasons revealed in Hirschhorn’s book the early outpatient pillar was not just overlooked but blocked. Physicians had to take enormous licensing risks and sometimes scorn from their peers to keep their patients alive. Those that did use these treatments had enormous success.  Hirschhorn describes how early outpatient COVID-19 treatment got its start in France and how frontline physicians from all over the globe like Vladimir Zelenko M.D. (who wrote the chilling forward) built off of the French approach to design their own “treatment cocktails.” Their protocols have consisted of existing drugs they knew well from the past pharmaceuticals like hydroxychloroquine ivermectin steroids antibiotics and nutraceuticals such as vitamins D and C zinc and quercetin. Not only were these treatments effective in keeping patients from getting sicker they were also safe and cheap often costing patients no more than $60 per drug. Shockingly the biggest obstacles to early treatment have not come from uninterested or disinterested patients but the U.S. health agencies and the World Health Organization. After reading Pandemic Blunder a reader will conclude these agencies conspired to keep early COVID-19 treatment out of the hands of the public. Hirschhorn goes as far as to call their actions criminally negligent. The ringleader Hirshhorn argues has been none other than Anthony Fauci the grandfatherly but powerful and political head of NIH’s Allergy and Infectious Disease division. Fauci exerts enormous influence in the medical science industry by having at his disposal billions of taxpayer dollars to distribute to research institutions and hospitals each year. On top of that the pharmaceutic industry pays NIH billions of dollars to conduct research which in turn creates a closed loop of influence peddling. Hirschhorn details Fauci’s numerous flip-flops on mask use herd immunity and vaccination inconsistencies which at first seem to be understandable in the face of a new and unpredictable bug. Hirschhorn however has found a pattern to these Fauci pronouncements that make it clear his intent has been political. Pandemic Blunder is the kind of book you will want to secretly mail to people who’ve relied on the media for virus information and live in terror of a virus. With early treatment the public will learn COVID-19 is not a death sentence. It provides an alternative to crazy lockdown approaches expensive hospitalization and experimental vaccines. Hirschhorn offers a list of resources for people wishing to get educated on early treatment where they can find the latest studies and locate physicians who will help them. By shedding light on what goes on behind the doors of our public health agencies and physicians when left alone can design better solutions Pandemic Blunder can help put an end to the fear factor that has turned our lives upside down.
