L, IAN: April 30 2021: Morning Adventures with a Doctor, FloridaSNMOMforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-29, Happy Friday! Today of course is grocery day. It’s also the day Draco is getting his first COVID shot. So he’ll be going with us to the grocery store today after his appointment. So yay more inoculations are a good thing! Thursday I had an appointment for SSI.. a psych eval. Why? I don’t know neither did the Psych. More below. As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos. If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we are going to check up on you. If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here. We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries. Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime! We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group! Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news!

The only reason I can think that SSI determination sent me to a psych was because of the FND diagnosis. They’ve done it to other people I know in my support groups. Well we got there a little after 8 am for an 8:30 am appointment. He had no clue why they had scheduled the appointment he said looking at my diagnoses there was no reason for me to be there because psych didn’t apply so it would just take a few minutes. He ran through his questions (I think I spelled “world” backwards wrong but whatever) and we were out of there in about 10 minutes or so. I went armed with three pages of information on FND with many citations statistics for how often Cognitive Behavioral Therapy the ‘go to treatment for FND’ about 13% in people with a psychiatric trauma induced case (which I don’t have) per FNDHOPE’s website what it is etc. I left that with him because he was interested in it. But none of the questions he had asked about it. He did ask what kind of day I was having (pretty good) and what my mood was (fine) and such.  I don’t know if his report will help or hinder me at this point because I have no clue what they were looking for. And neither did the guy filling out the paper. If they were looking to see if I was malingering he’ll put a resounding no to that in the report he said.  Symptom wise I was a bit twitchy but no full on seizures my voice didn’t give out and the brain fog wasn’t so thick I was using the wrong words for things. And that after a very busy and stressful week. Which kind of proves the point that this isn’t a ‘stress disorder’. I slept ok last night hip is doing better so my symptoms were minor today. But.. no accusations of women’s hysteria. No telling me it was all in my head etc. I’ve had neurologists tell me both in the past. He was actually pretty cool. Said he played in a metal band when he was younger his beard was dyed purple and we talked about some other incidental things Gen X things since he was about my age maybe about 5 years younger. It’s sad that I have to worry about new doctors and how they’re going to take my disorder. I wish there was better education out there. A lot of new research has been coming out proving it’s a neurological disorder with provable structural issues and causes but it’s new studies and not what ‘everyone’ learned in medical school at this point. So we’re fighting an uphill battle against it. Most of us leave our first and often only neurology appointment armed with a diagnosis and a website and that’s it or we’re brushed off to psych who then says there is nothing they can do and referred back to Neuro who says there’s nothing they can do.. and we’re referred back to our GP who usually has no clue at all what to do. FND and stress: Neurology MinuteSo I’m going to get the groceries today and then rest for the weekend. I do have history questions to write up and print out for next week but those won’t take me too long.  What are your plans for the weekend?
