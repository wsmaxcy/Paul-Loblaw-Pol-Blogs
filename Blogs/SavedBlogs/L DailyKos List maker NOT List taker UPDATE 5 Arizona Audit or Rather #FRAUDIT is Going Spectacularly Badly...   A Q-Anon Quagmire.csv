L, UPDATE 5: Arizona Audit or Rather #FRAUDIT is Going Spectacularly Badly...   A Q-Anon Quagmire, List maker NOT List taker, 2021-05-01, And of course people are believing it…  If you were like me and were confused what they could be doing doing with the UV lights… a judge has made Cyber Ninjas the RW conspiracy firm hired by AZ Republicans to recount AZ 2020 ballots cough-up their ‘playbook’ and here is the explanation: It is an invention so high tech only the inventor knows how it works; developed by ‘failed inventor’ Jovan Pulitzer.    [“A] mouse click will trigger all for (sic) microscope cameras to capture images”   their description reads.  Examining the folds they say can determine if it was machine or human handled…  Ummm okay but…     ‘However those policies made a critical error in guiding auditors on how to examine folds in ballots.  “If Election Day Poll vote note the presence of a visible fold” the policies direct auditors. “If non-Election day vote note the absence of visible fold.”     Pulitzer’s most well-known invention is the CueCat a barcode reader which placed number five in Time Magazine’s worst inventions of all time just under Agent Orange and beating out subprime mortgages.   IMPRESSIVE!!  (Actually  the RWNJs are peeing their pants over this.  They truly think this is  space age technology that will get the former guy back in office by August.)  Plus the UV light they are using is supposed looking for finger prints according to Former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett;  no it is looking for watermarks according to Newmax and Q!    The thing is Maricopa County Elections Department recently said their ballots do not have watermarks on them.  Don’t remember who Bennet is?  Let me remind you… he is a birther…  Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett made moves to appease birthers in his state this week petitioning the state of Hawaii to confirm the existence of President Barack Obama‘s long-form birth certificate which the White House released last year. In a radio interview with KFYI’s Mike Broomhead Bennett said he would consider keeping the president off the ballot if the state failed to answer his request.  There are 9 cameras… and the former guy has been watching it while he watches TV … knowing he is ripping off Arizona taxpayers instead of paying for it with his or his campaign funds.  (They already paid election and counting costs plus 2 audits with few anomalies)   OANN  has supposedly paid a large sum to be their only  “news” site … and lots more donors but those are secret as well.  Benner promises transparency…  so that means it ain’t going to  happen…  Months before the process started Cyber Ninjas owner Doug Logan retweeted messages claiming that an audit would find hundreds of thousands of new votes for D***** T****.   [asterisk mine] And Q Quislings are also on it…watching like hawks even though they do not know what  they are looking for…  (For a look into what the Q “patriots” think is truth do a quick scan of this guys  timeline… but not too far.  The rabbit hole awaits…  Disinformation is necessary...wink wink 😎. Most importantly was the link to watch the Audit. 🔥  This was interesting to find.  78% of Arizonans  requested vote by mail ballots and they were marked with a bar code so that they could be traced in their journey.  That means all their TrickyDick scams aside the bar codes hold the key info.   The rest is performance and drama. and a great way to scam more money from the MAGA Big Lie.  Tired of reading about the “election experts” and their follies?  Fear not there’s more…  Ron Watkins son of QANON ‘s Q… and internet porn host 8Kun and pig farmer in the Philippines… Jim Watkins  has become ensconced in the fiasco.   Ron has been using his site and other social media to lie and say tRUMP actually received 200000 more votes in Arizona...than he did.  On the message board Watkins commented that he has been talking with Bobby Piton a mathematician and investment manager who has theorized that the election was stolen. Piton attended the unofficial legislative hearing in November at the Hyatt in Phoenix as an expert witness and posted on social media that he spent “12 hours working on AZ Data” over the weekend.   The two agree that UV light will expose all the fake votes.  “Called [Piton] earlier and had a chat about the potential use of the UV light station” Watkins wrote. “Since UV is able to detect oil from fingerprints if there are no fingerprints on the ballot then the likelihood of the ballot being marked through a non-human process is high.” [FYO: Piton was suspended  from Twitter in NOV for his election lies...] In case you missed it…VIDEO showing cars of MAGA partisan ballot counters streaming in with Gadsden flags and  tRUMP sickers… and saying they refuse to speak to CNN…because **** told them to hate the mainstream media especially NYT and CNN.    There are cops   volunteer Arizona Park Rangers for hire…  and a Cyber Ninja guy says she is trespassing.  This is NOT about the ballots it is about cheating behind closed doors  by using partisan MAGA loyal counters only and  allowing only  non trained people  in to observe like Journalists.  THAT is NOT their job…  It is ludicrous.    VIDEO: “Yesterday we found a side door propped open at the AZ Coliseum entered the facility and made our way to the Maricopa County ballots. Today a judge ordered a temporary halt to the #ArizonaAudit based in part on security concerns. It was the 4th day we did this.”  https://twitter.com/morganloewcbs5/status/1385675150029320192?s=20  VIDEO:   “Here they are with our ballots. There are no city officials around there are no state officials around there are no county officials around” says @LaurieRoberts  on the “independent audit” of the Maricopa County 2020 election results.  It is in an arena but Republicans said not enough space for reporters… This publication is investigating the security of the fraudit.  The GQP do not know what election integrity is even if someone slapped them in the face with the  election protocol manuals… which seems apropos at this time.   Even a former AZ GOP AG says  the "audit" is a scam... UPDATE 1 :  To better explain some of the ridiculous crap in the Arizona audit here is an article with URLs:  What the Hell Is Going on in Arizona with this New “Recount”?     GOP State Rep. Anthony Kern defeated in the  Nov election said he was an observer and not counting ballots… guess what…   “Kern was active in "Stop the Steal" efforts. He also signed a letter with several other Republican lawmakers urging Congress not to accept the presidential electors selected by Arizona voters. And he was in Washington D.C. on Jan. 6 to speak to a rally outside the U.S. Capitol on the same day a mob stormed the building.” See more on the #Fraudit from Aldous J Pennyfarthing:  “Stop the Steal' lawmaker who was in D.C. on Jan. 6 is now auditing ballots in Arizona.”  and here: TheBradBlog  UPDATE 2:  Sunday May 2 2021 · 2:52:11 AM +00:00 · List maker NOT List taker    To keep in touch with the legal side away from this sideshow shitshow  here is the guy whose team assured  63 wins of 64 of 2020 election cases.  (And those are just the ones AFTER the election!)   The GQP are cooking up distractions and suppression and other ways to cheat… so please stay informed. Marc E. Elias@marceelias And here is his site:  Democracy docket:   democracydocket.com  UPDATE 3:    *Blast from the past:*   tRUMP and Republicans made it easier to steal an election by killing the Election Assistance Commission in February 2017.   It was the *only* federal agency that can help the states with vote anomalies.  In response he created a commission to investigate voter fraud led by controversial Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach that FAILED MISERABLY and was to SUPPRESS votes.    The supposed replacement was a sham and was disbanded.   And here you are!      And from the same people who say that the votes shoulg all have been counted only on election day here is your news for today…  “Maricopa County election audit could last weeks longer than expected has 'no deadline.'   Bennett said it would be done in a couple of weeks.  And now  possibly a month… and maybe more…  This ONE  STORY has called it an audit 22 times… including the headline. The Big Lie is being spread as credible even as the press question the validity and outcome.  And some are calling this a forensic audit.   UDG The press feels they can’t weight in but  you surely can.  It is a sham and a scam to please the flimflam man. PS:  If you hate my writing... I was  told by a reader that this was the worst story they ever read and no way should I be writing them.  Well I am not here to be a journalist.  Read the multitude of sources I ALWAYS add for that. I am a long time blogger and not a personal one who bares her heart and soul to the world… but I do keep lists and files do hours of research and stay informed.    Follow and read those who are great writers.  I will never be one.  And I promise …  I won’t feel badly  ...or miss you.   FYI:  for a country that supposedly takes voting seriously as a Canadian… when I call this a shit show I mean it!   It is a freaking mess.  The world is watching this fiasco.  And If you have not called your reps you are remiss…   Monday May 3 2021 · 7:47:07 PM +00:00 · List maker NOT List taker  UPDATE 4:     The digital evidence policies manual that the Cyber Ninjas were using were also a sham.  The manual was lifted from a policy manual  written by the DOJ.  Note WHEN it was copied:  The metadata on the CyFIR document that was copied from DOJ shows that it was created on April 24 the day after the audit began and the day after a judge ordered Cyber Ninjas to provide its policies and procedures for the audit.  And more on Anthony Kern: Q Candidate Anthony Kern was on the AZ ballot and lost.   Here is Kern at the top of the Capitol steps and then acting as a “volunteer” counting  ballots from a race he ran in. --->                         No wonder the former guy got rid of the  election commission in 2017 that would have dealt with this…  And why is the FEC only about election finance?   (Which is a joke as well BTW… but that’s another long story the world watches you flub) Q candidate Anthony Kern was a seditionist that was as close to the Capitol as  the worst of the worst seditionists although may not have gone inside.  That means he pushed hard to get where he was. VIDEO:  Here is Kern by the scaffolding If you have not called your reps isn’t it way past time?  Put their phone numbers on a coffee cup! Today's pool reporter is @kc_haas and she's reporting @anthonykernAZ who was fired for dishonesty who is on the Brady List who traveled to DC on Jan. 6 and lost a race on the Nov. ballot is again counting ballots in Arizona https://t.co/FW7kVuF8xZ  Rep Biggs was also seen getting a “tour” of the Fraudit arena.  (Can’t find the URL of the picture taken but will add when I do)  Found it… *scroll down to find the tweet.   Rep Biggs was also on the ballot in AZ… and...   Monday May 3 2021 · 10:46:56 PM +00:00 · List maker NOT List taker  UPDATE 5: The press is hard pressed to tell a story involving  politics without sounding partisan.   Real journalists are supposed to relay a story with careful impartiality and neutrality.  In this clickbait headline age and clown shows politics I am sure that is not easy.  (And rarely seen) EJ Montini news columnist at The Arizona Republic/azcentral since 1986 has stepped over those boundaries  by making an opinion piece highlighting Anthony Kern being chosen as a “vetted” non-partisan volunteer.   His editors must be on coffee break… because he even used the word Sham!
