L, Chris Cuomo Presides Over Santorum's Redemption UPDATED, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-04, Here's CNN's little morality play where Chris Cuomo sternly holds Rick Santorum to account -- and yet he still has his job. If this was the first time the CNN contributor did something horrible I'd say "Sure let him learn his lesson and move on." But that's not what's going on here. Rick Santorum is offensive on a regular basis and he's been that way all along. So while CNN may think they polished this little public relations turd all they've done is remind us of the double standard to which conservatives are held by the media. First Cuomo played the latest offensive clip. Then he chided Little Ricky and Little Ricky explained how he "misspoke." Nah that wasn't what he was talking about at all. Then Father Cuomo spoke sternly to the high-priced penitent. "I think it's instructive of the conversation we're going to have about your party. Why are people pissed off? It seems to be the continuation of a trend not with you but the newest manifestation of your party of beating up the little guy and making them seen as less than. Forget the natives. You have done this with homosexuality same-sex marriage minorities. and it seems like this is party of your party now that there's something wrong with these black people That's why bad trouble happens. There's something wrong with these gay people. They're not us. They're not us. We started this country. Who is why? You're like me you're a mutt who came here a couple of generations ago Rick. You ain't no pilgrim. So the point is this is a continuation of an 'us and them' and the 'them" are the Native Americans the Black Americans the gay Americans they're all others. They're not us white Christian types. But the white Christian types aren't even white Christian types. Do you see why it makes people so scared and so hurt?" When you won't let little Bobby play with you on the playground don't you think it hurts his feelings? How would you feel? If Santorum were a first grader this wouldn't piss me off so much. But he's a grown-ass man! And it's insulting to watch this ritual setup in which Chris the parish priest is going to grant him absolution. "Go and sin no more." But Santorum continues to sin over and over and over again!  This leads me to believe that CNN management wants Rick Santorum on-air for exactly this reason and I call bullsh*t. Don't piss on our legs and tell us it's raining. UPDATE (Frances Langum):  Don Lemon wasn't having it.   >> @DonLemon's reaction to Rick Santorum's comments: "I apologize to the viewers who were insulted by this. I was sitting in my office furious because he's done it so many times. So many times..." pic.twitter.com/UD00zTalI7 â€” Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) May 4 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
