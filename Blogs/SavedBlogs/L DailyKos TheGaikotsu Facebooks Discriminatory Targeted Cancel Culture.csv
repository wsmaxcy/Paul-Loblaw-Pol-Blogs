L, Facebook's Discriminatory Targeted Cancel Culture, TheGaikotsu, 2021-04-23, Have you found that you’ve been getting banned on Facebook more than usual or know a friend who has? It turns out it you may be targeted by Facebook.  Facebook is using discriminatory practices by targeting specific users and monitoring only their posts waiting for an infraction to occur.  Any post that the algorithm can misconstrue or take out of context as bad you immediately get banned. Once you are banned you are forever stigmatized on the platform.  The system’s algorithm will never trust you again.  In fact from then on it will dismiss every single appeal you submit instantly. You are also not allowed to report anyone for any infraction.  After all if you cannot be trusted to follow “Community Standards” then you can’t possibly know if others have trespassed. I have reported a person who posted a photo of a guy sucking his own junk.  Facebook said that was approved. I got banned for posting a GIF out of Facebook’s own GIF library of Marcellus Wallace of “Pulp Fiction” sitting in a chair. I have reported very clear and obvious racist memes that were getting posted daily on Egypt’s Treasures group and Facebook said that was fine.  How can Facebook make a faster-than-a-second decision that one picture was an infraction but another isn’t? Because it depends on the user making the request or post. Similar behaviors have been reported for political posts and responses.A post I made yesterday that got me banned a 2nd time in just a week lead me to this discovery. I was in a movie group and people were posting quotes from a movie that was the main subject of that thread. The movie was “Grandma’s Boy.”  I posted a quote from the movie and was instantly banned for harassment and bullying. Nothing in the quote had foul language suggested violence assault murder or contained threats or made any sexual references. Out of context it can certainly look bad.  So how do you know you are being targeted and not just a ‘bad’ user on Facebook?  Well I had my wife post the exact same thing I typed; word for word. No ban. It took her six posts in different threads before Facebook asked her if she was sure she wanted to post the phrase because it looked bad.  She had the choice to have the post deleted.  Yet to those who are targeted Facebook does NOT give you the choice. It’s as if they WANT to ban you although it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.  If the algorithm has the function of stopping a post for caution to give the choice of proceeding or not then why can’t it offer that function to all users anytime it triggers a response? What purpose is served by allowing you to break the rules and then delight in punishing you but not another user? How does that help Facebook?I started to whittle away what it could be that has me targeted and a good friend targeted but not my wife. I narrowed it down to politics. She does not engage in political discussion she doesn’t follow any political groups and Facebook does not “suggest” or throw into her timeline controversial political posts from other groups and users. Guess what Facebook does to my friend and I on a daily basis?  I was getting five or six suggested political posts for every two or three regular posts from actual friends.  It was as if Facebook was INVITING me to engage in political discussion a discussion that carries the possibility of saying something out of context that will get me banned. It got to the point where every response I made I had to use Haxor language because I was afraid of getting banned. It’s akin to a job with a manager who would like you to quit but has no reason to fire you. So they nit-pick any incident they can find and use it as an infraction to write you up so they can have a reason to fire you.  That is what Facebook is doing. But why? To silence dissent?  To silence users who would speak truth to power?I charge that Facebook doesn’t like anyone who speaks truth to power. Especially if that power is in relation to conservative politics or white grievance/nationalism. If you’ve spent any time in Trump-friendly groups schooling them on reality and challenging their propaganda with truth you are likely marked.I have been on Facebook since its inception. I had never been banned until 2019. After Mark Zuckerberg had meetings with top ranking Conservatives and Republican leaders. Remember that Mark was brought before Congress in 2016 because Conservatives complained that they were being unfairly censored on Facebook and they pressured Mark to make changes to his platform or risk having “monopoly” legislation levied against him splitting Facebook up.  It seems he traded holding Conservatives accountable for hate speech to attacking Liberals for speaking truth to Conservative power.On YouTube I see prominent political pundits complain of similar situations.  Like The Young Turks Waldorf Nation and The David Pakman show.  They’ve all made complaints that Facebook has been removing their content even when it is simply posting news articles that are publicly available. If Facebook is aiming to assist politicians in spreading their message they should also allow the people to speak out against or in support of those messages. Facebook is descending into yet another media arm for Conservatives.  Sure they put a stop to a lot of fringe but it seems to have the added benefit of silencing those whose intent is in the right place.I get that Facebook is a private entity and that the data they collect resides on their private property in server farms.  I also get that the removal of posts by Facebook on their platform isn’t a 1st Amendment infraction.  However they are a public business and have a public facing forum.  Therefore they are not allowed to discriminate based on gender sex race religion or political affiliation. I posit that Facebook is using discriminatory practices against users whose political views go against Mark Zuckerburg’s. I also believe that banning users from posting interacting asking for help on their Help Forums. But allowing you to see everyone’s posts and giving you “Fond” memories to share while you’re banned is a form of psychological torture and a cruel and unusual punishment; especially for wrongful termination of functions. Why not disable the account entirely?I am going to contact as many media outlets and frame this as cancel culture.  I do have the screen shots to back up my points.  I will try to frame this as Facebook doing the opposite of what they had done to Republicans in 2016 now they are doing it to Liberals.  I can’t tolerate the idea that I am a “target” on a platform.  If my voice was loud enough to get this level of attention then it must be loud enough to expose their discrimination.  I know it won’t get my posting privileges back but if I can put a dent in their PR I will!
