L, Trump gives Crackpot QAnon Influencers Press Credentials for his Sarasota Rally, Lefty Coaster, 2021-07-06, Mr. Trump is doing his best to pander to and empower QAnon conspiracy theorists.  By David Gilbert Two major QAnon influencers were given official press credentials to the latest Trump rally held in Sarasota Florida over the weekend signaling a new level of acceptance of the QAnon conspiracy theory by the former president and his team. In the build up to last November’s election Trump repeatedly failed to directly condemn QAnon instead calling them “people that love our country” and who “like me very much.”  Now Trump who QAnon supporters—and much of the Republican party—believe is still the rightful president appears willing to embrace QAnon even further by handing two of the movement’s most influential voices official press passes to his rally. Jeffrey Pedersen known in the Q world as In The Matrixx announced on his Telegram channel on Friday that he and his podcast co-host known as Shady Grooove had been approved by the Trump Organization for media credentials. “We are the news now” Pedersen wrote.  YEAAAAAA!!! pic.twitter.com/ROJSj7E0VZ  This isn't the first time a QAnon influencer got media credentials for a Trump rally. A QAnon show host for the major QAnon channel Patriots' Soapbox got credentials for a Trump rally in 2019 where he was pictured with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale https://t.co/AItOII5Cft pic.twitter.com/pJdr8ybWyM For Mr. Trump wants to raise the profile of malicious QAnon fantasies. Because both Mr. Trump and QAnon want to discredit fact based news and undermine faith in America’s elections.  The Republican Party is becoming the GQP.
