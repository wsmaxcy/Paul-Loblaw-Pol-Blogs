C, Harry Reid: Yeah we might have some UFO wreckage laying around someplace , Jazz Shaw, 2021-05-01, Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been back in the news a surprising amount this year though it’s generally not because of his political positions. Reid as you may recall was one of the three senators who helped set up the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) more than a decade ago. While that program allegedly ended later being replaced by the UAP Task Force (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena or UFOs as we used to call them) Reid has remained highly interested in the topic and remains in touch with elected officials and our military. He’s given several interviews in the past couple of weeks with a few more big ones coming up discussing recent revelations including video and photos allegedly showing some of these remarkable craft. But few have contained as much of a potential bombshell as the one he did with the New Yorker. During that discussion Reid didn’t simply refer to “sightings” of anomalous vehicles. He went one very large step further and suggested that the United States may have been in possession of materials retrieved from crashes of such craft. And who had these materials? Reid suggests that you’d have to ask Lockheed Martin. (NY Post) Former Nevada Sen. Harry Reid believes US defense contractor Lockheed Martin may have once had fragments of a crashed UFO in its possession it was revealed Friday. Reid 81 told The New Yorker that he had never actually seen proof of the remnants — but tried unsuccessfully to get approval from the Pentagon to find them. “I was told for decades that Lockheed had some of these retrieved materials” the Democrat told the magazine. “And I tried to get as I recall a classified approval by the Pentagon to have me go look at the stuff. They would not approve that” Reid continued. “I don’t know what all the numbers were what kind of classification it was but they would not give that to me.”  Frustratingly Reid doesn’t go into any further detail. But that’s quite the figurative grenade to roll into the room and then just walk away isn’t it? Oh sure. They had the remnants of some sort of crashed flying saucer but they wouldn’t let me see it.  Like most of us in the community Reid is waiting to see what comes out of the UAPTF report that is due to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee by June 25. But he clearly sounds like he’s had a preview of at least some of it and believes that another shoe is about to drop. On the same day that Reid’s interview dropped at the New Yorker Lue Elizondo the former head of AATIP was being interviewed by Steven Greenstreet of the New York Post. While still not going far enough to violate his non-disclosure agreements Lue became quite blunt in some of his answers this time. He described his “holy s***” moment when he first realized that these things were real and we had no idea where they came from or how they do what they apparently do. (Craft observed doing Mach 15 or more in the lower atmosphere and executing nonballistic right-angle turns.) He also went so far as to tell Greenstreet that he’s seen this with his own eyes and reviewed all of the radar and other sensor data confirming this reality. Going even further Lue declares that the Pentagon is fully aware of the reality of these UAP and they have covered up that information for a long time. Why? That’s where we get into some speculative theory but let’s just say that there are different players inside of the Pentagon with their own motives and agendas. Most of us who have been on the outside looking in for quite a while now responded with a collective sigh. “Duh. Ya think? Really?” One other resource I’ll suggest for you is a different interview that Harry Reid did a little more than a week ago with George Knapp at Mystery Wire. Knapp and Reid are old friends and the former Senator always opens up when talking to him. He still doesn’t believe in “little green men” but he knows that there’s something going on that defies explanation and could represent a serious national security threat and he wants to get to the bottom of it. In closing I’ll include the Elizondo interview if you wish to watch it. The guy really is fascinating and the possibilities he raised are beyond intriguing.
