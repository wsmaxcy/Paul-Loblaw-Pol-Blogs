L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Rick Allen- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-06-29, In both 2016 2017 2018 2019 as well as 2020 that “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” presented profiles of the sitting U.S. House Representative from Georgia’s 12th Congressional District Rick Allen who after being elected for the first time in the 2014 elections quickly made himself infamous in Washington for an outburst he made that pissed off even his fellow Republicans back in May of this year when a week after Democrats cried foul after Republicans flipped their votes in support of an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have prevented government contractors from discriminating against employees based on their sexual orientation and gender identity a second version passed with 43 Republicans actually supporting the idea. In the wake of that vote Speaker Paul Ryan tried to gather many members of the GOP House where Rick Allen pulled out his Bible and read Scripture to those present specifically passages from Romans 1:18-32 and Revelations 22:18-19 that in effect read that gays are sinners “worthy of death”.  At that point several of his colleagues stormed out disgusted (and they should be).Well Rick Allen went viral because after the tragic shooting in Orlando just days later as some were calling for some action ANY action on gun control the GOP offered their usual support to victims… their thoughts and prayers. In this instance that came off as a lot of hollow bulls*** in particular because Rick Allen was one such person who got on social media to let those mourning know he was thinking and praying about it. To which some of the victims had to wonder “So what are you praying that more of us die then?” Allen was asked if he regretted or wanted to apologize for his remarks about the gays being “worthy of death” and surprise… he didn’t regret them at all and stood by his decision to read them at that Republican meeting.      So it should come as little surprise that Rep. Allen spent his first term in office voting for anti-choice legislation without exceptions for rape and incest attempts to defund Planned Parenthood attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the bill to attempt to halt the resettling of Syrian refugees in the United States. But when you come from a conservative district in Georgia the voters won’t pay attention to any of that or sweat that or the fact that you quoted Bible verses about gays being worthy of death and they’ll re-elect you with 58% of the vote.His fourth term in office is already starting to look like the first three: We want to note that Rick Allen remains one of the Republicans in Congress who you would think would hold Donald Trump in some sort of contempt given that he caught Covid-19 in November of 2020 just in time for Thanksgiving and that he was one of the members of the House who literally helped barricade the door against Trump’s attempt to have a violent mob execute members of the legislative branch on January 6th. But no this idiot voted to still contest the results of the 2020 election and then voted against the impeachment of Donald Trump. He apparently reserves all of his aggression for LGBTQ citizens he thinks deserve to die.       One Year Ago June 29th 2020: Rick Allen (GA)… 2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago June 29th 2019: Rick Allen (GA)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago June 29th 2018: Rick Allen (GA)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago June 29th 2017: Rick Allen (GA)… 2017 UpdateFive Year Ago June 29th 2016: Rick Allen (GA)… Original ProfileSix Years Ago June 29th 2015: Charlotte O’Hara (KS)
