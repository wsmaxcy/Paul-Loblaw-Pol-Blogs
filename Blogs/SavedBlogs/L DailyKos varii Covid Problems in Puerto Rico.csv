L, Covid Problems in Puerto Rico, varii, 2021-04-23, The Covid-19 problems are getting worse in Puerto Rico.  First: last week I was informed by email from The USPS that a “priority mail” package arrived at the distribution center near me. I have not received that package to date. I spoke to our postmaster (a very nice person) and she said they are at a very difficult moment right now as more and more employees are out due to Covid and very little mail is being delivered right now. Pictures of mail build up here. Of course this is having an effect on businesses who are cutting staff or opening only on certain days. If you call the utilities (water and power run by the government) you are very lucky if you get connected to an operator since there are so very few of them working now. There are of course many reasons for the increase of Covid cases. The most obvious to me is our Trump-like governor: 1. After his inauguration last January the governor said he did not like all the restrictions put on residents because they infringed on “civil liberties” so he eased many restrictions that were working. I guess he did not realize that Covid doesn’t care about “civil liberties”. 2. Just last week medical experts and many mayors asked the governor to issue an executive order to close the beaches. The governor said “no” because he claims there is no evidence that many Covid cases come from the beach. Here is my evidence: the beaches are packed on the weekend with locals enjoying the day. I don’t even go anywhere on the weekend because the traffic is so heavy on Saturday and Sunday. (I live near the beach.)  At least we do have SOME restrictions due to Covid but I can tell you things are not getting better here even with vaccinations.
