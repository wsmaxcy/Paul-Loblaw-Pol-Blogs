L, Another example of the fall of the media, yogibear1963, 2021-05-05, Current headline at yahoo.com:  “’Senator could determine fate of Biden’s agenda” Insultingly obvious for a wonk in the know but maybe targeted for ignorant readers. It is the lede that hurts: “Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Utah could be the 50th vote for — or against — President Biden’s ambitious agenda.” Sinema is from Arizona. Ever since the corporations decided that the news had to turn a profit it has been a race to the bottom with profit the only goal. They happily took pre-written stories from republican operatives slanted headlines and stories usually against Democrats to push narratives that were deemed profit generators cut and paste someone else’s work and hire on the cheap. Facts don’t matter as long as the headlines collect eyeballs.  (the story was written by Andrew Romano who gets it right the yahoo headline teaser was probably written by someone else who is bad at their job but it turns a profit)
