L, For my religious friends of any denomination: How do you refer to the name of G-d?, CameronProf, 2021-06-27, I was raised with certain rules on how to refer to our creator and to write his/her name down. I know this differs with people from other religions than mine so I am curious as to what title you use when referring to him/her?  Wikipedia has an OK summary of the names of G-d in Judaism but as a general rule when I write G-d I leave out the O as we are not supposed to write his name on anything that can be destroyed (Simple summary but I’d rather not divert this convo in a certain direction).  When I refer to G-d in everyday usage I use the term Hashem which can be found in Leviticus 24:11 and means “The Name” in Hebrew.  How about yourself? Are there any specific terms that you use?
