L, Crystals, OjibwaforStreet Prophets, 2021-04-27, Welcome to the Street Prophets Coffee Hour cleverly hidden at the intersection of religion and politics. This is an open thread where we can share our thoughts and comments about the day. Let’s look at some crystals to start the discussion. The Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals in Hillsboro Oregon houses a world-class collection recognized as the finest in the Pacific Northwest and one of the finest in the United States.  Richard and Helen Rice constructed the building that would become the museum as their family home in 1952. The Museum building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its unique architectural style natural stonework and the extraordinary native Oregon woodwork found throughout the building.  One of the displays points out that “All rocks are made of mineral crystals.”                   This is an open thread—all topics are welcome.
