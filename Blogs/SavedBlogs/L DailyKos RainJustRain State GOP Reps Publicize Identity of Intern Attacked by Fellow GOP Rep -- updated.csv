L, State GOP Reps Publicize Identity of Intern Attacked by Fellow GOP Rep -- updated, RainJustRain, 2021-05-04,  Jane Doe who has requested that the AP not use her name was a 19 year old intern with the Idaho State Legislation. In March she reported that then-Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger a Republican from Lewiston had raped her.  Doe made a police report two days after the attack and reports were also made to the Idaho attorney general and to the Idaho House ethics committee. The committee announced a public hearing. Doe was called to testify at the public hearing. Within hours von Ehlinger’s supporters began publicizing Doe’s identity. One of his attorneys released a letter to the media that included Doe’s real name. Two far-right websites posted Doe’s name and details about her life and one included her photo.  …. Rep. Priscilla Giddings a Republican from the tiny community of White Bird shared the link with Doe’s name and photo in a newsletter to constituents and said the allegations were nothing more than a “liberal smear job.” She also shared the blog post with thousands of followers on social media making the intern’s identity widely known.  “Doe was shielded from public view during the hearing and the committee warned everyone her identity should stay private.” However as Doe left the hearing some von Ehlinger supporters rushed out to the hallway to try to film her. “Boise resident Karen Smith herself a former Statehouse intern who attended the ethics hearing to support Doe heard the intern screaming in the hallway after she was accosted....When Smith found the group Doe was curled up in a ball on the floor as her legal team tried to shield her with umbrellas. The onlookers were trying to get close to the young woman to videotape her and take photos.” Doe's lawyers claim that several State Police were present but did nothing to assist. According to the AP report security footage shows one state trooper standing between Doe and the von Ehlinger supporters while another talks to the group.  After a legislative ethics committee voted unanimously that von Ehlinger engaged in “conduct unbecoming” a lawmaker he resigned before the full House could vote regarding his removal.  According to the AP Jane Doe is being represented by the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual & Domestic Violence Thank you ptressel for this additional information. GOP lawmaker faces calls to resign after doxxing alleged rape victim Idaho state Rep. Priscilla Giddings a Republican faced renewed calls to resign on Monday following her decision to out an alleged rape victim. In a Facebook post the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual & Domestic violence urged supporters to "demand accountability from Rep. Giddings" and to "ask her to resign." The call echoes a recent demand for an investigation by the Idaho House Ethics Committee into Giddings' actions by the Idaho 97 Project a state group focused on countering disinformation and extremism. Giddings’ term is up in 2022.  She ran *unopposed* in 2020.  In 2016 the vote was 71-29 in Giddings’ favor so this is a very red district.  However we should Run Everywhere and not just as a token.  Running gets our message out.  It trains our new candidates gets their campaigns up and running.  It forces the Republicans to spend money.  It provides an outlet for local Democrats to get active and organized.  If the Republicans are asleep at the switch or if their increasingly toxic officeholders do something especially toxic (remember Roy Moore...) we might even get some surprising wins.  But we don’t have to win for the other benefits to accrue. ballotpedia.org/… Ok now Aaron von Ehlinger.  He too ran unopposed in 2020.  He’s out now ergo there may be a special election which would mean sourcing a candidate quickly.  In 2018 there was a D vs R race in this district which came out 59-41 in favor of the R so very red but maybe not as much so as Giddings’ district. ballotpedia.org/...
