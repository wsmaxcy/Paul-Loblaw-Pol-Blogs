C, It’s Official: Dems Want Tax Cut for The Rich, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-13, If you need proof that Democrats are really on the side of the plutocracy look no further than New York’s Democratic House members who today wrote to Speaker Pelosi threatening to vote against any of (P)resident Biden’s tax increase proposals unless the bill includes full repeal of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction limitations that were part of Trump’s 2017 tax reform. The SALT limitation was the single most “progressive” tax increase on the rich in years but chiefly in high tax states like California Illinois New York and New Jersey. Read the letter for yourself and enjoy the casuistry: We need SALT repeal the New York Dems day so that our taxpayers won’t be “double-taxed” but of course their citizens only face this problem because those states impose those extra high taxes. And most of the benefit of the SALT deductions go to high income people—the very people Dems are always telling us should pay their “fair share” which they never define in any concrete way. “Fair share” just means “more.” Well Trump delivered that so what’s the problem? I also like how the letter in paragraph three admits that cutting taxes on the rich will help spur job growth. I thought liberals didn’t believe in supply-side tax cuts?
