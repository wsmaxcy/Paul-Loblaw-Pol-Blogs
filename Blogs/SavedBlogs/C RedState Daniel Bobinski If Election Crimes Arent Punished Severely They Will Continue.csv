C, If Election Crimes Aren't Punished Severely They Will Continue, Daniel Bobinski, 2020-11-04, Election 2020 has played out as I predicted. Using a plan that was announced this past spring (and probably concocted much earlier) Nancy Pelosi’s $3.6 Billion taxpayer-funded push to send ballots to everyone on the voter rolls was a Democrat’s dream. Of course Twitter and Facebook played their assigned role beautifully. For the past month we’ve been seeing Public Service Announcements from Twitter and Facebook telling us “Election experts confirm that voting by mail is safe and secure” and “You might encounter unconfirmed claims that voting by mail leads to election fraud ahead of the 2020 US elections.” Unconfirmed claims? First that would be what comes out the south side of northbound bull. In a recent column I wrote for UncoverDC I provided multiple verified examples of mail-vote fraud and some of those had been reported just this past weekend. Second as I predicted on September 16 the Democrats would be stuffing ballot boxes with fraudulent mail-in ballots all in an effort to throw confusion into the election results because they knew President Trump was going to provide them a serving of their own hind side on a silver platter come election day. And what have we seen? Voting machines were “allegedly” down and unable to process their votes. Voters were told by poll workers “If you leave [your ballots] with me I promise I will turn them in for you at the end of the day.” When voters objected they were told they could leave and come back later – even though they’d already signed in to vote and would be unable to do so again. After voters chose to stay and wait the machines magically started working again.    In Arizona people who checked online to verify their mail-in ballot had been accepted on Friday found that it had been accepted. But when they double checked on election day they saw their vote had been canceled. More than one person posted about this on Twitter.   When Joe Biden gave his three-minute speech the night of the election he was nearly 15 points behind President Trump in the Pennsylvania vote tally with approximately 64% of the votes counted. Or so they say. More on that in a minute. First let’s look at what Biden had to say. “We believe we’re on track to win this election. We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote that it’s going to take a while. We’re gonna have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished. And it ain’t over til every vote is counted. But we’re feeling good. We’re feeling good about where we are … We’re feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way it’s gonna take time to count the votes but we’re going to win Pennsylvania.” As I said at the time of Biden’s remarks Trump was nearly 15 points ahead of Biden in Pennsylvania. To catch up and surpass Trump nearly every uncounted vote would need to be for Biden – a statistical impossibility. But let’s also look at votes counted versus voter registrations. Pennsylvania has 6469000 registered voters. When they stopped counting votes in the wee hours of the morning they’d counted 5447809 votes. That’s 85.91% of the possible number of voters. Why were they reporting they’d counted only 64%? If it looks fishy and smells fishy it’s fishy. I know Twitter and Facebook and other social media platforms who are in bed with the Democrats will probably censor this column. I. Don’t. Care. I’m tired of self-censoring. We already have a media that failed to report the “alleged” financial activities of Joe Biden with China. Someone would need an IQ below 70 to think that if the same news had been reported on President Trump the media wouldn’t be screaming at the top of its lungs for Trump to be jailed and that he be tried for treason. The fact that legacy media and social media colluded to keep that story hush-hush make them in my opinion co-conspirators in treason. If America is to remain a functioning Republic once the voter fraud has been identified and Trump is inaugurated into his second term serious consequences need to come down on these treasonous people and corporations. The Left will scream that Trump has become Hitler and is cracking down on his political enemies. Again – that’s what comes out the southbound side of a northbound bull. He won’t have to run for re-election again so WHO CARES? Pelosi Schiff Biden Schumer – the whole lot of them need their deep state ties exposed and the full extent of the law must be brought to bear. And if Attorney General William Barr doesn’t have the backbone to do it. Trump should replace him with Rudy Giuliani. Will it mean our county will suffer divide? Tell me it’s not already divided. Might as well scrape the wound clean and get all the infection out or it will never heal.
