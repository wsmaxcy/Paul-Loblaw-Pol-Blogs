BBC Biden declares state of emergency over fuel cyber-attack The US government declared a state of emergency on Sunday after the largest fuel pipeline in the US was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack. The Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel gasoline and jet fuel. It was completely knocked offline by a cyber-criminal gang on Friday and is still working to restore service. The emergency status enables fuel to be transported by road. Experts say fuel prices are likely to rise 2-3% on Monday but the impact will be far worse if it goes on for much longer. Multiple sources have confirmed that the ransomware attack was caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide who infiltrated Colonial's network on Thursday and took almost 100GB of data hostage. After seizing the data the hackers locked the data on some computers and servers demanding a ransom on Friday. If it is not paid they are threatening to leak it onto the internet.  The Guardian Afghans bury their dead after dozens of girls killed in school blasts Dozens of girls were buried on Sunday at a desolate hilltop cemetery in Kabul a day after a secondary school was targeted in the bloodiest attack in Afghanistan in over a year. A series of blasts outside the school during a peak holiday shopping period killed more than 50 people mostly female students and wounded more than 100 in Dasht-e-Barchi a suburb of west Kabul populated mostly by Hazara Shias. The government blamed the Taliban for the carnage but the insurgents denied responsibility and issued a statement saying the nation needed to “safeguard and look after educational centres and institutions”. Saturday’s blasts came as the US military continued the withdrawal of its last 2500 troops from the violence-wracked country despite faltering peace efforts between the Taliban and Afghan government to end a decades-long war.  NPR India Sees Deadliest Day Of Pandemic With COVID-19 Deaths Topping 4000  India reported its highest daily death toll — 4187 people — on Saturday weeks into the world's worst wave of coronavirus cases that's leaving people without lifesaving hospital beds oxygen and drugs. In all nearly 240000 people in India are confirmed to have died from COVID-19 with reported infections topping 21 million. It's a bitter turn for India which had managed to see cases decline over the winter. But by late March a second wave swelled and now is ripping relentlessly through the country with around 400000 new cases and more than 3500 deaths reported every day. But as bad as the government's official numbers are they are almost certainly a vast undercount. "There's a shortage of tests" Santosh Pandey who resides near the holy city of Varanasi in northern India told NPR in April. "Nobody's getting tested so the government's numbers for our district are totally wrong." Crematoriums across India have said only a fraction of the bodies they receive each day are getting counted by the government. Reuters More than 1400 migrants arrive on Italy's Lampedusa  Fifteen boats packed with hundreds of migrants landed on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday and officials said they were expecting numbers to increase as the weather improved. More than 1400 people got off the vessels at the Mediterranean island one of the main landing points for people trying to get into Europe ANSA news agency said. "Migrants arrivals are resuming alongside good weather" Lampedusa's mayor Toto Martello told state broadcaster RAI. "We need to restart discussions about the immigration issue." Around 11000 migrants disembarked on Italy's coasts from the start of 2021 to May 7 up from 4105 in the same period last year interior ministry data shows.  About 400 migrants of various nationalities got off one of the boats a drifting fishing vessel ANSA reported. Another boat carrying 325 people was intercepted eight miles off Lampedusa the agency added. Other migrants reached Lampedusa coast aboard smaller vessels. Deutsche Welle Germany: SPD officially names Olaf Scholz as chancellor candidate Germany's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) voted on Sunday for the current Finance Minister Olaf Scholz to be their choice for chancellor should they win the September general election. The former mayor of Hamburg won 96.2% of the votes from the almost 600 SPD delegates who were taking part in this weekend's online party conference. Sunday's result was far from a surprise as the party leadership had already nominated him for the candidacy — more than a year before the election. The now officially confirmed chancellor candidate gave his thanks to the party in a tweet saying "I want to thank everyone for this great result. It is the foundation for the change that we will work towards. Now let's get to work!"        Recent opinion polls have put the SPD behind the CDU/CSU at around 16% with the Greens increasingly taking the top spot with an estimated 26% of the votes.

Washington Post The sun may offer key to predicting El Niño groundbreaking study finds When it comes to long-term hurricane forecasts tornado predictions in the Plains or prospects for winter rain in California you’ll often hear meteorologists refer to El Niño or La Niña. They’re phases in a cycle that starts in the tropics spreading an influence across the globe and shaping weather both close to home and on different continents. Now there’s emerging research to suggest that cosmic rays or positively charged high-energy particles from space might be the mechanism that flips the switch between phases. Cosmic rays come from outside our solar system but the number and intensity that reach Earth hinge on the magnetic field of the sun. A swing between El Niño and La Niña can have dramatic implications on global weather bringing widespread shifts in precipitation and changes in temperature that can be problematic for vulnerable populations and have massive economic effects. In California for instance flood events during El Niño periods have proven 10 times more costly than those during La Niña events. In some parts of the world that depend heavily on agriculture and marine commerce a flip from El Niño to La Niña can alter daily life.
