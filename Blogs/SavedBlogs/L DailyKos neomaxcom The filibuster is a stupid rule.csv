L, The filibuster is a stupid rule, neomaxcom, 2021-07-06, How stupid?  Imagine being in waning moments of the fourth quarter of a championship football game and your team is losing.  It is fourth down and fifteen yards and you’re on your opponents 36 yard line.  Your coach would under NFL rules call a time out and conference with his QB about the hail-Mary pass you need to win …. but in this case the coach for the opponent is Mitch McConnell. We all know Mitch is one to stretch the rules.  He looks at the clock. There is less than a minute left and the opposition team trails by two point. There is plenty of time to run two plays one to center the ball in the field and the other to punch through a field goal.  In Mitch-world it is not the offense that calls the time-out to let them prepare for the likely winning field goal.  Instead the defense calls not a time-out but a filibuster and the entire defense just walks off the field.  Because the filibuster is an extended time-out not a forfeit with a loss the defense wins as they were winning when play suspended.  That is how the filibuster works. It stops a bill in its tracks and on that issue the game is over until there is new game … i.e. a new Congress.  It is stupid rule.  There are many ways to take into account the interests of the minority besides giving one side the requirement for a super-majority.  For instance you could do what they do in a football game … that is give them a fixed number of time-outs. You could even let the first time-out cause a month’s delay; the second time out could be for two weeks and even allow a third ‘time-out’ for another week. Some of the more official ideas include would include requiring the minority actually stand on the floor and debate until they can’t (traditional filibuster) or even require the minority call a vote where they would have to deliver a specific number of bodies to the floor for a vote.  But what really makes the whole filibuster thing stupid is its inherent contradiction of purpose as it is today.  Cloture is synonymous with filibuster and it suggests that debate on a topic is to end.  Unfortunately the option of the 60-vote minimum needed to end debate is now used to preclude debate in the first place.  That means every filibustered debate while aimed at continuing debate by defeating cloture and progress to a vote begins with a deafening shout of shut the fuck up.  Like I said this whole FILIBUSTER thing despite the tradition ought to be recognized for what it is — STUPID. PS: I’m a former Senate staffer of a former southern senator (93rd Congress) and I used to grudgingly accept the ‘wisdom’ of filibuster but now recognize that Mitch McConnell’s abuse of the tool is so gumpist it’s trumpist ‘cause stupid is as stupid does.
