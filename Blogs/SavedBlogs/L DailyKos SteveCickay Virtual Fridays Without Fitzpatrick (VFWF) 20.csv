L, Virtual Fridays Without Fitzpatrick (VFWF) 20, SteveCickay, 2021-06-27, Virtual Fridays Without Fitzpatrick (VFWF) 20 In Response To Your 06/25/21 Newsletter Your Continuing Failure to Support H. R. 1 the “For the People Act of 2021”: Part II. Congressman Fitzpatrick your silence is deafening while our democracy is attacked.  It’s another week and we get from you another set of photo-ops while our democracy is repeatedly assaulted by the Republican Party.  But why should we expect anything more from you? You voted with your Republican herd against H.R. 1 the "For The People Act of 2021" which would make vital necessary protections and improvements to our democracy.  And now it languishes in the Senate where your Republican minority uses the relic of Jim Crow filibuster (https://www.npr.org/2021/03/30/982411563/in-push-to-end-filibuster-democrats-point-to-its-civil-rights-era-history) to prevent the will of the majority to preserve our democracy (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/senate-to-vote-on-s1-for-the-people-act-bill.html). Republican senators won’t even allow debate on this critical subject. Meanwhile your Republican Party passes legislation all over the country to restrict not expand voting rights in response to the Big Lie that so many in your Republican Party are still stupidly deluded by (https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/28/politics/voter-suppression-restrictive-voting-bills/index.html ). And you say nothing to expose the falsity of this Big Lie so dangerous to our democracy. Even Republican Senator Mitt Romney spoke out against the Big Lie on CNN today. Where is your voice? This week the Department of Justice sued the State of Georgia led by your fellow Republicans over its recent undemocratic racist voter legislation. " The Justice Department is suing Georgia over  the state’s new election law  alleging Republican state lawmakers rushed through a sweeping overhaul with an intent to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot. “Where we believe the civil rights of Americans have been violated we will not hesitate to act” Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday in announcing the lawsuit." https://apnews.com/article/ga-state-wire-georgia-voting-rights-laws-voting-c552e88d294e5f35e2eea595177bc4b5)  And you again say nothing.   Instead we see more photo-ops.   And you say nothing to your constituents about the critical issues of defending our democracy in town halls because you are too frightened to have town halls where your poor voting record can be challenged.   So again you say nothing.   While our democracy is under attack.    However concerned citizens who love our democracy and are not frightened to speak up to defend it will be near your office next week on the last day of June. They will be ringing the alarm bell for democracy a bell which you refuse to hear. These concerned constituents see a deadline for democracy a deadline which you fail to see. These lovers of our democracy have the courage to speak out against the Republican attacks on democracy attacks which you chose to ignore. You instead remain enveloped in a shroud of silence about what is critical to our nation.   These brave selfless patriots who care deeply about our democracy will not be silenced. But the question is: will you paid by your constituents to defend our Constitution and our democracy ever break your silence about the attacks that your Republican Party are shamelessly unleashing on our beloved but oh so fragile democracy?  We wait and listen but all we hear are the sounds of your silence.
