L, New Day Cafe: "World's Most Cutting Edge" Library, samanthabforNew Day Cafe, 2021-04-29,  The public library in Aarhus Denmark had been called “the world’s most cutting edge library”. I haven’t compared and contrasted but it does have the world’s largest tubular bell---one that rings every time a baby is born is Aarhus-—so there you go.  There's a public library in Aarhus Denmark that has the world’s largest tubular bell which rings every time a baby is born in the city. New parents can push a button in their maternity ward to alert the masses.https://t.co/Uw60lnj8qOh/t Amy from my library class  From Time “’DOKK1 is an unusually successful encounter between two beautiful Danish traditions: On one hand our cultural ambitions to open up all branches of knowledge to every generation and social class and on the other hand our sense of functional and beautiful design’ said Denmark’s Minister for Culture Bertel Haarder in a press release about the win. ‘I am very happy about the prize which is a huge credit to Aarhus.’” Some photos: A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  A post shared by Nathan Chong (@nathanchongkarnin)  A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  A post shared by Kristian Paakjaer Fotos (@kristian_paakjaer_fotos)  A post shared by Dokk1 Aarhus (@dokk1aarhus)  Grab a cup of coffee and share what’s on your mind this morning.
