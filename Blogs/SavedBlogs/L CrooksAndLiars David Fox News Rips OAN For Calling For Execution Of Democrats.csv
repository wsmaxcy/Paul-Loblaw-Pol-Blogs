L, Fox News Rips OAN For Calling For 'Execution' Of Democrats, David, 2021-06-28, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  	Fox News host Howard Kurtz on Sunday accused conservative news network OAN of using "unproven" claims about the 2020 election to call for the execution of election workers who presided over former President Donald Trump's loss. 	"Pearson Sharp got pretty worked up over the unproven rigged election claims saying lots and lots of people worked to steal a victory from Donald Trump" Kurtz explained before playing a clip of Sharpsuggesting that "execution" was one possible remedy for the "traitors" who worked to oust the former president. 	"So he would kill all the traitors who haven't yet been identified somehow let alone charged?" Kurtz asked. 	Sharp later claimed that he was not calling for "thousands" of people to be executed due to Trump's election loss. 	Kurtz offered no additional comment about whether it was fair to call election workers "traitors." This is part of our continuing coverage of the 2020 elections.
