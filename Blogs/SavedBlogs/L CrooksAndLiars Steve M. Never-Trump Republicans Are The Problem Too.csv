L, Never-Trump Republicans Are The Problem Too, Steve M., 2021-04-25, I don't like the way this is framed:  Saying that the events of January 6 were an indication of a "crisis" is like saying that below-zero weather in Siberia is an indication of a  "crisis." It isn't -- it's just the nature of the environment. And even  if you want to call what's happening in our politics a crisis it's not a  "Trump crisis" -- it's a Republican crisis. Glasser seems to grasp that more or less. She writes about the new book  by former House Speaker John Boehner who criticizes extremists in his  party (even though they used to be his allies of course):  Boehner draws a straight line from the [House] Freedom  Caucus’s ascendancy to January 6th. He denounces the group’s members as  “political terrorists” who emboldened the actual terrorists who stormed  his old office on Capitol Hill flatly debunks various Trump conspiracy  theories and calls the insurrection a “low point for our country.” I’ve  always believed that the transformation of Congress into what Boehner  calls Crazytown was both a prerequisite for and a warning indicator of  the Trump follies to come. This account offers some sharp new material  for that thesis. And yet:  In an interview with Time magazine Boehner admitted  something that he did not in the book itself which is that he voted for  Trump in 2020 understanding full well that the President would never  accept any election result that did not have him as the winner. “I voted  for Donald Trump” Boehner said. “I thought that his policies by and  large mirrored the policies that I believed in.”  ... Many of Trump’s critics within the Republican Party voted for him  too as did those like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger who have emerged  post-January 6th as leaders of a small but vocal new Republican  congressional opposition to the former President. They did not repudiate  him when it would have mattered and that in the end is why he is  gone but not at all forgotten. The Trump Administration is over; the  Trump crisis is not. People magazine tells us that George W. Bush didn't vote for  Trump -- but he threw his vote away in a manner that I'm sure left him  very pleased with himself:  He ... freely admitted he did not vote for either incumbent Republican President Donald Trump — of whom he has been only obliquely critical and never by name — or Democrat Joe Biden in the November election.  Instead Bush wrote in Condoleezza Rice who served as his secretary of state from 2005 to 2009. And Bush walked back some recent criticisms of his party probably  because he has a new book of paintings he's trying to sell and he knows  that most of the people who bought his early work were Republicans:  In an appearance on the Today show  earlier this week he said of the Republican Party: "I would describe  it as isolationist protectionist and to a certain extent nativist."  He clarified those comments to PEOPLE saying "Really what I should  have said — there's loud voices who are isolationists protectionists  and nativists something by the way I talked about when I was  president."  "My concerns [are] about those -isms" he continued "but I painted with  too broad a brush ... because by saying what I said it excluded a lot  of Republicans who believe we can fix the problem." Bush and the others can't quit the party even though it has become  almost exclusively nativist and even though it's redoubling its efforts  to steal elections apparently having concluded that the only thing  wrong with the way Trump was going about was that he and his party-mates  hadn't made what he was trying to do legal first. In The New York Times Rick Hasen writes:  A new more dangerous front has opened in the voting wars  and it’s going to be much harder to counteract than the now-familiar  fight over voting rules. At stake is something I never expected to worry  about in the United States: the integrity of the vote count. The danger  of manipulated election results looms....  Some of these efforts involve removing from power those who stood up to  President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020  election. The Georgia law removes the secretary of state from  decision-making power on the state election board....  Republican state legislatures have also passed or are considering laws  aimed at stripping Democratic counties of the power to run fair  elections. The new Georgia law gives the legislature  the power to handpick an election official who could vote on the state  election board for a temporary takeover of up to four county election  boards during the crucial period of administering an election and  counting votes....  A Texas bill would ... give challengers at the polls the ability not only to observe but to interfere with polling place procedures meant to ensure election integrity. According to a new report  by Protect Democracy Republican legislators have proposed at least 148  bills in 36 states that could increase the chances of cooking the  electoral books. Even David Brooks understands that as the headline of his latest column puts it the GOP is getting even worse.  Since the election large swathes of the Trumpian right have  decided America is facing a crisis like never before and they are the  small army of warriors fighting with Alamo-level desperation to ensure  the survival of the country as they conceive it....  This level of catastrophism nearly despair has fed into an amped-up warrior mentality.  “The decent know that they must become ruthless. They must become the stuff of nightmares” Jack Kerwick writes  in the Trumpian magazine American Greatness. “The good man must spare  not a moment to train in both body and mind to become the monster that  he may need to become in order to slay the monsters that prey upon the  vulnerable.”  With this view the Jan. 6 insurrection was not a shocking descent into lawlessness but practice for the war ahead. But no one will do anything about it. Bush Boehner Kinzinger and Liz  Cheney still consider themselves Republicans in good standing. Donors  who said they'd withhold money from pro-insurrection GOP officeholders  are giving to those officeholders again as Glasser notes.  No one ever asks Republican critics of the party how they can remain  members in good conscience. We know the answer: It's because what's  happening now is an evolution not a break with the past. Boehner Bush  and others engaged in or enabled right-wing radicalism until it went  too far for them.  But if it really has gone too far and some of them think we're in a  crisis they have to make a clean break or they're still enablers. The  press has to ask every Republican who claims to be appalled by Trumpism  and January 6: So shouldn't you quit the party? Do you see any evidence  that the party will abandon the Big Lie of Democratic election theft  that it will abandon the extremism Trump embodied (but didn't create)  that it will abandon nativism and white nationalism? And if you think  you this is a temporary crisis what are you doing to bring it to an  end and why isn't it working? Why does it seem to be getting worse?  But that won't happen. These people will still win praise from the  mainstream media and from moderates (and some liberals) for in effect  doing nothing. They'll never be questioned this way.  They've been protesting ineffectually for years insisting that they're going to take the party back. Remember this book?    The former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator under George W. Bush presents a detailed and provocative critique of the Republican party's increasingly conservative and extremist views recommending a moderate solution-based approach to government that the author believes is more in line with traditional Republican principles.  It came out in 2005. It accomplished nothing. And the problem has only gotten worse since then.
