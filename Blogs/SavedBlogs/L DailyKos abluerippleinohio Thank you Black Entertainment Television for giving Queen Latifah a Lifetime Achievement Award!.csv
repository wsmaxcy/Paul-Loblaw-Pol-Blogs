L, Thank you Black Entertainment Television for giving Queen Latifah a Lifetime Achievement Award!, abluerippleinohio, 2021-06-29, Thank you Black Enterainment Television for giving Queen Latifah a Lifetime Achievement Award. Here’s a clip from that show. Here's an excerpt from an earlier diary about the songs from Queen Latifah did that l liked and still like. Queen Latifah encouraged me to take no disrespect when she recorded " U N. I. T. Y." It was the first time I felt it was okay to not accept being called a b****. Don't get me wrong; I liked her earlier works as well. In fact here's "Ladies First" featuring Monie Love. Here's the song that made me a fan of hers "Dance for Me". Here's a tweet highlighting Queen Latifah getting her Lifetime Achievement Award. All hail the QUEEN! @IAMQUEENLATIFAH Greatness!!! #BETLifetimeAchievement pic.twitter.com/sq8BvN5Eld Thank you BET for giving Queen Latifah her flowers and her respect.
