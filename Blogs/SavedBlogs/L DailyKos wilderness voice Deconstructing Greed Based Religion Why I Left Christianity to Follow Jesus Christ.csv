L, Deconstructing Greed Based Religion: "Why I Left Christianity to Follow Jesus Christ", wilderness voice, 2021-04-25,  Melissa: Over the past several years I have been increasingly frustrated with the religious-political establishment of Conservative Evangelicalism in America which claims the name of Christ and doesn't understand or follow his most basic teachings. I've tried to combat the misinformation by reaching out to people in a gentle and loving manner on this channel. I live to help people reconnect with God in ways that are meaningful to them and in harmony with what Christ actually taught. Now in light of current events in America - the Black Lives Matter movement and the riots etc. -- I cannot remain silent in response to the arrogance and hard-heartedness of the religious right. I have to speak out and I have to be more direct. The religious right wants to point the finger at those they consider "the sinners" just like the religious establishment in Jesus's day did. This country is on the brink of either coming together in humility and love (I relentlessly believe we will do this) or experiencing the suffering of our injustice and oppression. We need to open our eyes to the fact that as free Americans in a wealthy "Christian" nation the responsibility lies squarely on us to seek justice love mercy and walk humbly. Transcript starting at 2:38: In this video I'm gonna talk about my problems with Christianity as a political religious establishment in the US. I am a follower of Jesus Christ. If I have a religion it is Jesus Christ and what he taught and modeled: God is one love God and love your neighbor. That's what Jesus taught and that is my religion and I am first and foremost above and beyond anything else a follower of Jesus Christ. But the Christ that is recorded in the four Gospels is very different at times from the Christ that is worshiped and idolized by conservative evangelical American Christianity. After 2000 years for church doctrine to evolve and become entwined in military and politics the two [now] don't even resemble one another. Here's a few examples of what I mean. Conservative Christianity in the US says bomb your enemies. You have to make a show of force to show them who's boss and keep them from coming after you. And yes these are actual words spoken and posted all over Facebook after certain events from a few years back that will remain unnamed in this video. In contrast Jesus said love your enemies. He commanded Peter to put his sword away. This is the reason that the religious leaders were able to rile the people up against him to demand his crucifixion because he refused to be a military leader and to take up arms against Rome. Showing us that even though oppression of others is the thing that God hates the most as evidenced all throughout Scriptures violence is not an answer even to that. But that the way to free people from oppression is self sacrificial love. Conservative Christianity says things like make America great again we have to put ourselves first at the expense of the rest of the world. At the expense of the environment at the expense of minority groups who suffer because of our way of life. These are not words that I'm pulling out of the air or that I'm making up. I've been a part of the Christian Church in America for almost 34 years now. These are things that I have heard spoken over and over and over. In contrast Jesus said those who want to be great must be a servant. Those who are least now will be greatest in the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of heaven is within us. That means that no religious establishment no political agenda no military might will ever make a society great. The only thing that will make a society great it's the spirit of love that we have within our hearts. Change happens within and is expressed from person to person as we create in the world around us the love that we hold in our hearts. Conservative Christianity in response to the problem of millions of people who are homeless or experiencing extreme poverty says things like this: "we live in America the greatest country in the world. They have legs they can walk to the rescue mission figure out how to get a job. I've worked for everything I have God has blessed me and I don't owe anyone anything". Not something I'm making up. Things that I've heard over and over. In contrast Jesus said feed the hungry give a drink to the thirsty clothe the naked visit the sick and the imprisoned take in the homeless. This is how you can tell that you know me because I am in the least of these. That homeless person that I drive past with a car full of groceries - that was Jesus I drove past. This is the number one reason that I left Christianity. I'm gonna be really blunt here guys if you don't understand this basic teaching of Christ that we are all one with God. Through him that when I drive past a hungry person on the street I am driving past Jesus. If you don't understand that then stop using the name Christian because people who do understand that are fed up with the inconsistencies and that's why they are leaving the church in droves. Because American Christianity is so disconnected from its Christ. I know I'm coming down hard guys and my intention is not to shame anybody but this stuff needs to be said. Conservative evangelical Christianity in response to systemic racism says things like I'm not racist I never owned slaves I won't apologize for my skin color I don't bow my knee to anybody. But Christ in contrast - Christ never asked anybody to the kneel to him. That's gonna sound like heresy to some but it's the truth. He didn't but he did ask us to do is to recognize him in the least of these and take care of the needs of those less fortunate. What he did spend his time doing is going up against the systems of political and religious oppression that existed in his day prophesying judgment against them over and over and over if they did not change their ways. Jesus Christ asked us to confess him by giving a drink to one of these little ones. Jesus Christ would much rather have you take five minutes to sit down and listen to your neighbor to see if maybe there is some truth to his claims. And that even if you personally are not directly responsible for his suffering if there is something that you can do to help ease it. Jesus Christ would much rather have you do that than to attend church Sunday morning and raise your hands in worship of him. When even one of your brothers or sisters is telling you that they do not feel comfortable or accepted in your church service. Evangelical Christianity and again and speaking of the system as a whole here not speaking against individual people except to hopefully present this information in a way that can maybe help open some eyes. But as a whole we go to church Sunday morning we sit in pews we sing worship music about how God loves us and God is for us. And then we go back to our lives and don't give a second thought as to whether God is also for our homeless neighbor muddy grimy carrying his sleeping bag as we pass him on our way home from church. Or whether or not God is also for our one or two black church members who attend our church who have to go back to their lives and deal with God knows how much prejudice. We sing songs about how God is unstoppable and we raise our hands and think about all the problems that we have in our lives that we want him to work out for us and don't give a second thought to those who may be suffering because of our way of life. Is God unstoppable for them too? And might he have to stop us and our way of life in some ways in order to help them? We don't want to think about these things because we don't want to be guilty or responsible or to realize that as a member of one of the wealthiest countries in the world we might actually be the oppressors that the very Bible that we claim is our word of God condemns. We might actually be closing our eyes to the power that we have to make people's lives better or worse. We have freedom we have wealth we have comfort. We've worked for sure I get that. My husband and I lost our jobs have got kicked out of our apartments twice within three years. We spent years not knowing if we had enough food to feed our kids from week to week. We had to do a 180 mindset shift. Tons of intense core inner work and lots of really hard work in the outside world to get to the point where we are today where we could even afford to purchase our own house with a yard for our kids to run around and play in. And I was painfully aware even when we were living under other people's roofs that the fact that we had a roof over our head made us more wealthy than most of the world's population. I am a huge proponent of taking personal ownership. I actually have pretty extreme views on this I get accused of being new-age on a regular basis on this channel for my views on the power of our mindsets. I actually believe that we create everything in our personal reality by our mindset and our perception of what's happening to us. It is OK for me to say that when I'm talking about my personal life or if I'm helping somebody to better themselves who wants to be helped. But when we are talking about people who our way of life is oppressing it is absolutely not ok to think in those terms and apply those expectations to others who are less fortunate than ourselves. The only response to those who are suffering is compassion and being willing to sacrifice what is necessary to ensure that everybody else can experience the same benefits that we do and this right here is the hypocrisy that drives people out of evangelical Christian churches. We think that because of the benefits that we enjoy here in America God has blessed us. This is the same mistake that the religious leaders of Jesus day made they thought that because they were wealthy they were blessed by God and those who were suffering were the sinners. That's why they made the statement "Jesus eats with tax collectors and sinners". Today we blame the sinners as removing God's blessing from this country and destroying what made our nation great. For those of you who go to church every Sunday morning and then go on about your lives supporting a political agenda to make America great again let me ask you this question: When was America ever great? Were we great in our founding when we wiped out millions of Native Americans? Gunned them down along with their children. When we purposefully infected them with smallpox wiping out entire communities? When we evicted what was left of them from their land and forced them to travel across country? Did the Trail of Tears make us great? Was America great when we built our country on the backs of slaves? When we herded them together like animals and the bottoms of ships where they died in disease and starvation? When children were allowed to take days off school to watch public lynchings? Most conservative evangelicals who touts make America great again would have a huge problem with any of these things listed. I'm not saying that anyone is in support of them now except for fringe groups but the problem is that our whole way of life revolves around a religious political system namely conservative evangelical Christianity that wants to pretend that our country was founded on God's principles and God's blessing and wants to close its eye to the absolute travesties committed in this country's founding. If God blessed us it was in spite of us not because of us. And now the religious right wants to point its fingers at liberals gays people of color. Anybody who is different from them and say they are the reason that we are losing God's blessing. Why? Because we legalized gay marriage. Do you really think that God cares more about what two loving people do by themselves in a bedroom then he cares about the mass murder of innocent people and the herding of people like animals. Do you really think he blessed us when we committed those reprehensible acts and that he is just now removing his blessing from us because we are finally starting to show compassion to those who are different from us to make sure that they are not hated and ostracized their entire lives? The sin of America is great and by that I mean the sin that the entire religious political American system is based on. Conservative evangelicals are quick to say that this country was founded on their religion. Then anyone who takes the name of Christian needs to take responsibility for this country since our food supply is built on the suffering of animals. Animals are packed into barns held in place with metal bars so that they can't move their heads standing knee-deep and their own waste. Mothers separated from their babies not allowed to see them. Kept there like prisoners their entire lives cows milked until they are bleeding baby chicks put alive into grinders. Our diet is based on the suffering of other living beings. Let me brush it off and say oh they're just animals they're not as important as us. Do you really think that God is okay with us treating his creation this way? Our medical system and I'm not talking about doctors and nurses who have dedicated their lives to helping people. I'm talking about the people behind the scenes. I'm talking about big pharma. Those determining what goes into the school textbooks. This whole system is based off of the suffering of humans off of keeping people sick so that drug companies can profit off of them coming back to continuously buy more drugs. Our entire capitalist consumerist way of life is built off of consuming finite resources. It is destructive to the environment and it is not sustainable. It's based off of arrogance selfishness and greed. Thinking that as long as we have comfortable lives now who cares what our great grandchildren have to deal with. Prejudice and systemic racism is still rampant in our society. How do I know this? Because every single person of color that I have personally talks you attest to this and they can tell story after story of how they have been mistreated. Do we really think that God blesses this? That God has ever blessed this? Ezekiel 16:49 and 15 says Sodom's sins were pride gluttony and laziness while the poor and needy suffered outside her door. She was proud and committed detestable sins so I wiped her out as you have seen. The detestable sins of Sodom were pride gluttony and laziness and I don't think I've read a better description of America than this description right here. America may be one of the best societies that the world has created so far in terms of economic prosperity personal freedoms at least for some. Equal rights although we're still progressing in that department but it was never great. It was built on the backs of the suffering and the oppressed and it still is it is prideful gluttonous or greedy and lazy. It doesn't take care of the needy on his doorstep or those within its walls. Although I have to say all of this is beginning to change and part of the turmoil that we are experiencing today is because people are awakening. We are not okay with how things have been done up to this point and we want to do better. Our civilization built as it has been on the backs of the suffering and the enslaved and the oppressed and built as it still is today on the suffering of animals and people and the destruction of the earth and the environment. It cannot last. It cannot sustain itself forever. We don't want the turmoil we don't want the uprising because we're happy and content with our way of life. We're comfortable. We're free. Nothing's bothering us and this right here is the worst sin that we have committed - to be so prideful and so greedy and to close our eyes to the suffering of those around us. And this is the number one reason why I left the religious institution of Christianity. Because at least here in America it is in bed with a corrupt political system. It corrupts the character and nature of God and uses fear of an eternal afterlife torment in hell to keep people in line and legislate their behavior. It operates on the assumption that this world is going to hell in a handbasket and there's nothing that we can do except protect ourselves and our own and make the best life that we can for ourselves now until Jesus comes back to take us out of here and get us to heaven. Too bad for those suffering. It's not our responsibility. They're probably going to hell anyway I'm not accusing every Christian of thinking in these terms. There are many many very compassionate Christians Christians who do their best to reach out and make a difference in the world.I'm talking about the religious political system. The doctrinal positions that evangelical Christianity is built upon. Christ actually taught that the Kingdom of Heaven is here that he had come to actually save the world. To draw all people to himself and that we have an important role to play in the world's saving and that our role involves producing fruit in keeping with repentance and that that fruit is loving our neighbor and loving our enemy. As humanity we can be great only when we are willing to humbly listen to those who are different from us and work together to abolish oppression and injustice in all of its forms. We will be great when we learn to let go of our religious and political ideas and simply learn to love our neighbor. I'll be the first to say that I do not have all the answers a lot of the issues that we are dealing with today feel very complicated and overwhelming. And there are multiple viewpoints on multiple sides that needs and deserve to be considered. I do know this -the answer will not come through politics [editorial note - I am not endorsing Melissa's views on politics  - wv] and I am certainly not espousing a political agenda in this video. The only answer as far as I can see as far-fetched as this sounds is that we have to learn to heal ourselves within. We have to learn how to heal ourselves and how to heal each other on an individual level so that we can self-govern from within. People can continue to fight to get their man or woman in office and everything that is accomplished will just be overturned by the next person in line and we're never gonna get anywhere by the constant political battles. We're never gonna get anywhere as long as we have to be governed from outside. You cannot legislate morality. This is the biggest error of conservative evangelicalism in the US. You can't legislate people's hearts. Change has to happen from within and the way that this occurs naturally is by loving people and that's something that we can do. We can love our neighbor. Love is what softens and changes hearts. Love is what changes people from the inside. I also know that the answers won't come through religion. Christianity needs major doctrinal reform. You cannot preach Christ crucified and deny the needs of your neighbor sitting next to you in the pew. You cannot preach the God is love and also teach that he will torment people endlessly in hell forever just because they were born into the wrong religion or because they never heard the name of Jesus or because they were raised by an abusive Christian father and turned them off to religion. This is the foundational error that leads to Christian hypocrisy and hard-heartedness towards the suffering. Honestly I personally don't see reform happening within the church fast enough although I could be wrong. But reform is already happening outside the church and Christianity as a religious system will either get on board with it or it will die out. And the real church will be in the streets taking care of the needy feeding the hungry loving the least of these. The one thing that I can say with great confidence is that God is love and that love is the only thing that is powerful enough to change the world. What can we do? I don't have all the answers. What I can say is that to work through the issues that we are presented with today requires vast amounts of humility. The ability to listen to those who are different from us with open hearts and open minds and to work together in compassion and harmony with those who are different from us. Here's the one thing that I do know - get up every day and treat every person that you come in contact with as if they were you. As if they were Jesus. Because they are you they are Jesus. If you drove past Jesus on the street muddy and grimy and carrying a backpack would you go by or would you stop and give him your whole car full of groceries? If Jesus came up to you in church one day and complained that he had been experiencing prejudice because of his skin color would you laugh it off and ignore him tell him to quit whining — this is America it's the greatest country in the world go create a life for yourself? Or just sit down and listen with a humble heart and say hey what can I do to help make your life a little bit easier? And how we would treat Jesus in any given situation is how we should be treating everybody that we come in contact to the best of our abilities. And I know we can't do everything for everybody and it's very easy to become overwhelmed looking at all the suffering in the world. But all that we are asked to do is to love the person that we are with in each moment to do the best that we can with every situation that we are given.. And if we can get this if we can do this the political and religious reform will take care of itself. If we can do this our problems will solve themselves. If we can do this we can heal the world. Don't forget to talk to me in the comments. Be loved. Be happy. Be at peace. Thank you for watching. End transcript. Notes: 1. Melissa takes a hands-off attitude towards politics. This is appropriate for who she is and what she is trying to accomplish. My presentation of her work here is not intended as endorsement of this attitude for Daily Kos. 2. This diary is not intended to provoke yet another installment of the ongoing debate between skeptics and spiritualists as to whether or not the spiritual dimension exists. Nonetheless I recognize that some participants will engage this issue regardless of my preferences. Note the following rule of the road: DO NOT ... Insult the character intelligence or background of people with whom you are arguing. You want to win an argument? Then don’t engage in ad-hominem attacks. Telling spiritualists that they have arrived at their beliefs merely because they are uncomfortable with the idea of death falls in this category. If you want to debate stick to the evidence.
