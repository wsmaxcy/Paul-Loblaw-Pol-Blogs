C, Biden’s ‘Unity’ - Unites Leftists and Government Bureaucrats Against US, Seton Motley, 2020-11-09, Big Media has disingenuously declared barely cognizant utterly corrupt Democrat Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election. All of Joe Biden’s Homes In Photos Never mind the pesky little Constitution and its process for actually electing a President.  Which never ever mentions the media. Never mind the amazing array of voting irregularities that have transpired. It’s really unusual how the only states counties cities and localities that have a problem counting votes each election – are always run by Democrats. It’s more than a little strange how every counting error – and nigh every post-Election Day vote – all always redound to the Democrats’ benefit.  And there are nigh always just enough overtime votes – to snatch crooked Democrat victories from the jaws of actual defeat. Can Tech Fix Elections? Actual tech conceivably could.  Our Leftist lying censorious Big Tech?  Not so much. A Mess in Michigan: Glitch Turns Red County Blue Plus 138000 Sudden Votes for Biden Let’s stick with the pencils and paper ballots shall we? But as a thought exercise let us join in Big Media’s disingenuousness and pretend Biden has actually won the election.  So as to analyze what the next four years will be like. Hint: Things will be exceedingly terrible.  Predicting this does not require one to possess Nostradamus-level skills. Biden Victory Promises End to Tumultuous Four Years for Government Under Trump: “The former vice president has said he will lean on and empower the federal workforce.” One of President Trump’s very many signature successes?  Dis-empowering the federal workforce. Deregulation Nation: President Trump Cuts Regulations At Record Rate Trump Cuts 22 Regs for Every New One A policy which contributed greatly to the nation’s HUGE betterment. Regulatory Reform Spurs Economic Growth During Trump’s First Term Five Economic Records Trump Set in 2019: “Lowest ever overall unemployment; lowest ever Black unemployment; lowest ever Hispanic unemployment; highest ever stocks; highest ever credit scores.” President Biden re-empowering the federal workforce – means many MANY more regulations. Which means a great many exceedingly terrible things to come. Nine Radical Ideas in the Biden-Sanders ‘Unity’ Platform How’d they pare it down to just nine?  All of them and more will INSANELY empower existing government bureaucrats – and many MANY more to be hired. Biden’s “unity” platform partner?  That would be Vermont Communist Senator Bernie Sanders.  Not Socialist – Communist.  He’s the guy who honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Mark Levin Describes How Biden-Sanders ‘Unity Platform’ Mimics 1936 Soviet Constitution: “Joseph Stalin’s constitution reads remarkably similar to key Biden document….” This is the only “unity” about which Democrats actually care. Joe Biden Promotes Unity Turns to Business of Transition It has nothing to do with you know getting along with anyone in the country to the right of Karl Marx.  Leftists make Enemies Lists of those people. The government-mandated atrocities Biden Inc. has planned for us are nigh endless. Speaking as we did of tech and Big Tech…. Biden-Sanders Task Force Backs Net Neutrality Municipal Broadband: “The Democratic ‘unity’ task force…wants to empower the Federal Communications Commission to police how broadband providers treat internet traffic.” There’s that word “empower” again. The task force’s proposals are awful for tech.  But they are great – and great big gobs of government cronyism – for Big Tech: “Network Neutrality…would outlaw Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from charging Big Tech for the MASSIVE bandwidth they use. “Which means we would pay MUCH more for our Internet service – to subsidize the trillion-aire Big Tech companies. Net Neutrality is also a terrible and massive expansion of power for the bureaucrats Biden is looking to empower. As always as government expands – the private sector contracts.  More regulations mean less investment in the sector being regulated.  Because duh. If I was making five dollars on my hundred dollar investment – and new regs reduce my five dollars to two dollars – I will find many better places to invest my money.  And the sector in which I was investing will shrink. Oh: And Net Neutrality is a long-standing Communist wish-list item.  So says an avowed Communist: “Net Neutrality’s intent: ‘(T)he ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control.’… “Net Neutrality (is) a part of (a) Communist (re)construction project: ‘There is no real answer but to remove brick by brick the capitalist system itself rebuilding the entire society on socialist principles.’” And “municipal” broadband – is government broadband.  It is Biden and his Communist manifesto looking to “get rid of the media capitalists” – and “rebuild…brick by brick” with lots and LOTS of bureaucrats.  By having bureaucrats pretend to be competent capable Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Except bureaucrats are awful at pretending to be ISPs.  Shocker I know. Broadband Boondoggles: “For decades local governments have made promises of faster and cheaper broadband networks. Unfortunately these municipal networks often don’t deliver or fail leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. Explore the map to learn about the massive debt waste and broken promises left behind by these failed government networks.” In short: Biden Inc. will regulate into non-existence the fabulously successful private sector Internet.  And replace it with government-only DMV-Post Office Internet. In short: If Big Government Big Media Big Tech Big Hollywood Big University and government schools K-12 manage to steal this election for Biden? We are in a for a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG and very terrible four years. And we will never again have an even remotely honest election.
