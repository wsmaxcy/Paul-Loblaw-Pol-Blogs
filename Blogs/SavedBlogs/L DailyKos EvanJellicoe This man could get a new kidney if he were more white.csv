L, This man could get a new kidney if he were more white, EvanJellicoe, 2021-07-07, The actual title of the Slate article is “Jordan Crowley Would Be in Line for a Kidney—if He Were Deemed White Enough” a title which happens to be exactly accurate. But let’s look at it a bit more clinically for the benefit of white people who protest “But I am not racist! I have no personal issues with anybody else’s racial background!” That claim may be true. But what I often find in talking to other white people about racial matters is that they are blissfully unaware of the amount of racial bias that is built into the system as well as the amount of malicious racism being pushed by other white people. That is why I often challenge them to go online and Google “(x) while black” [with the parenthetical x; it affects the results]. Try it yourself! One nasty little truth that I figured out a long time ago is that the racial identifiers “white” and “black” are not equivalent but opposite positive identifiers. Rather one is positive and the other is negative as is made clear whenever a printed form gives you the choice of checking either “white” or “non-white.” I remember filling out such forms in my childhood (they seem less common now but the idea remains). If the form has a blank for racial identity you are either white or not white.  Jordan Crowley is considered not white. Why? Because he has three white grandparents and one black grandparent. Now to you and me that works out to ¾ white which rounds up to white. But no his doctors consider him black which can only mean that if he is not deemed fully white then he is not white at all.  Jim Crow anyone? Now here is where one might ask why it matters in the first place. Well the answer is that some time ago some researchers came up with the superficially plausible idea that black people have a different threshold for kidney disease than white people. The threshold for being eligible for a kidney transplant is a GFR reading of 20 or below (the GFR number is linked to how much creatinine is in the blood). Jordan Crowley has a measured GFR of 17 making him eligible to go on the waiting list for a kidney. But. . .there is an adjustment for Black people. Their raw GFR number gets bumped up by 21%. And when the 21% adjustment is factored in his level becomes 21 and he is not eligible. At this point I would say that even if that adjustment factor were genuine (more on that in a moment) then his factor should adjust by ¼ of 21% which puts his adjusted GFR at just under 18 and he is eligible. But the “blackness factor”  is a simple is or isn’t and Crowley is black (in the opinion of his doctors) and so his GFR level is pegged at 21 and he is not eligible. Now about the validity of the GFR adjustment in the first place. It has to do with data that suggest that normal creatinine levels in Blacks and Whites are differen: . . .during development of the mathematical model authors found that overall the population of Black patients in their study had higher levels of creatinine in their blood compared with the group of white patients. The authors reasoned this was likely because “on average black persons have higher muscle mass than white persons.” They added a race-based coefficient to correct for what they assumed must be naturally high levels of creatinine in Black patients recommending that doctors inflate the eGFR of patients by 21 percent “if Black.” Any astute person can see so many falsities in that reasoning that I won’t even bother pointing them out except to say that if “muscle mass” is the actual causative variable then the adjustment itself should be based on muscle mass not the race associated with it.  So anyway there you have it. Racial bias in the respected field of medicine so deeply embedded that most people would never become aware of it unless personally affected. Oh one other thing: just being on the kidney waiting list is no guarantee of a cure because there are way too few kidneys available for way too many sick people. So a good many people on the wait list will die before getting a kidney. But here’s the kicker: Fifteen people die while waiting on the kidney transplant list every day. On average nine of those dead will be Black. That works out to 60% of the dead being Black people. So tell your white friend who insists she isn’t racist that maybe she’s not racist. . .but the system sure is. And ask her to help change that.
