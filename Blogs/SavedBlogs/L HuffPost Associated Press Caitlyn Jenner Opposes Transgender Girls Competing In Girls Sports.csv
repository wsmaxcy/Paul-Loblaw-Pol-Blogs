L, Caitlyn Jenner Opposes Transgender Girls Competing In Girls' Sports, Associated Press, 2021-05-03, Caitlyn Jenner the former Olympic champion and reality TV personality now running for California governor said she opposes transgender girls competing in girls’ sports at school. Jenner a 1976 decathlon Olympic gold medalist who came out as a transgender woman in 2015 told a TMZ reporter on Saturday that it’s “a question of fairness.” “That’s why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls’ sports in school. It just isn’t fair. And we have to protect girls’ sports in our schools” Jenner said Saturday during a brief interview in a Malibu parking lot. It was Jenner’s first comment on the controversial issue since announcing her candidacy to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom in a recall election. Five states have passed laws or implemented executive orders this year limiting the ability of transgender youths to play sports or receive certain medical treatment. There’s been a vehement outcry from supporters of transgender rights. Jenner a Republican supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election but later criticized his administration for some discriminatory actions against transgender people. Many transgender-rights advocates have criticized Jenner saying she has failed to convince them that she is a major asset to their cause.
