C, Saturday Night…, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-27, …is Center of the American Experiment’s Annual Dinner featuring Laura Ingraham as our keynote speaker. The Annual Dinner has historically been a great event featuring speakers like Margaret Thatcher Mikhail Gorbachev and the first President Bush. Last year due to the covid shutdown we had to go to an all-online format.  Saturday’s event will be a hybrid: around 400 lucky individuals will attend in person at the brand-new Viking Omni Lakes Hotel in Eagan Minnesota. There are a handful of $200 tickets left with seats in the viewing room if you are in the Twin Cities area and would like to attend. Detailed info and tickets are available here until the last few are sold. The event begins with a reception at 6:00 Central followed by dinner at 7:00 and the program at 8:00. But the event is also available for free online viewing. To watch the show online all you have to do is go here and enter the password “annualdinner.” There is no need to register in advance.  To accommodate efficient online viewing the program will begin promptly at 8 p.m. Central and will be over by 9:15. Laura Ingraham will speak and will take questions from the audience including the online audience. It should be a fun evening.  My only advice is if you do decide to tune in be sure to be online by 8:00. The program will begin with a walk-up video that you don’t want to miss! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
