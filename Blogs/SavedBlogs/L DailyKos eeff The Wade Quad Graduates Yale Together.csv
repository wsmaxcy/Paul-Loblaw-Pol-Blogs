"Yale won. They made the best offer and it was the benchmark for my sons" said Darrin. "Not only that but the alumni reached out and made themselves available to us as a family. I had people I didn't know calling and saying we want your sons there and they are going to be sure they are taken care of" he added.

Today.com Quadruplet brothers graduate Yale together and reveal what comes next But while they spent the past four years at the same institution Aaron Wade told TODAY Parents that the "Quad Squad" as they have been dubbed found their own individual footing. "We were all busy college students" Aarson said. "It wasn’t very often that we saw each other especially not all at the same time." Through eight semesters there was only one class that overlapped between Aaron and Nigel. "It was 'Psychology and the Good Life'. It's one of the biggest classes in Yale history" Aaron explained adding that the size required the lectures to be video recorded and broadcasted. "So even though I was technically in this class we were often not in the same building for it."

Zach meanwhile will soon move to San Francisco to do investment banking for Goldman Sachs while Aaron - who had a ceremonial graduation with his brothers - will stick around for one more semester to do his senior thesis before graduating in December and moving to New York City to work for Google.

I just get to sit back and flip through the channels in each of my brother's lives and be like 'Whoa he's doing this and this.' It was just cool to brag like 'Oh I have three brothers and they're all so smart and talented.'" There are a lot of videos & pictures of these guys in the links. What a story!
