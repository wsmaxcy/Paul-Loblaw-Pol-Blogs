C, The filibuster is not a relic of the Jim Crow era, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-26, Among the  falsehoods Joe Biden mouthed at his press conference yesterday was the  claim that the Senate filibuster is “a relic of the Jim Crow era.” This line  originated with Barack Obama. Biden said he agrees with Obama’s assertion. As many have pointed out Biden  defended the Senate filibuster for decades. And Obama himself  defended it when he was a Senator. Thus Biden and Obama are both hypocrites. To make matters worse both are peddling a false claim. The Jim Crow era  extends from the mid-1870s following the abandonment of Reconstruction by President Hayes to 1964 when landmark civil rights legislation finally was enacted. The filibuster predates that era. It was used before the civil war and on issues unrelated to race. For example Democrats employed the filibuster  in 1841 when they opposed legislation to create a national bank. That same year there was a  filibuster over the firing of the Senate printers.  Four years earlier Whigs had  used the filibuster against Democrats who moved to expunge from the record a Senate resolution censoring Andrew Jackson.  In reality the filibuster was very rarely used against civil rights legislation until near the end of the Jim Crow era. It wasn’t needed for that purpose because only in the late 1940s did Congress muster much enthusiasm for passing such legislation.  Arguably the most significant use of the filibuster until at least the 1950s occurred in 1917 and had nothing to do with race. That year a dozen antiwar senators led by the progressive leader Robert La Follette  filibustered legislation to arm American merchant ships against German submarines. This filibuster led understandably to a rule authorizing cloture (the cutting off of debate) by a two-thirds vote. There was however a notable and sickening use of the filibuster against civil rights legislation in the early 1920s. Republicans at the urging of President Harding sought to enact an anti-lynching law. Democrats filibustered. Harding eventually had the legislation pulled so that other items on his agenda could get a vote. (In those days filibusters were of the talking variety and thus held up the Senate.) The filibuster was used against anti-lynching legislation in the 1930s as well. Civil rights legislation was filibustered routinely and largely without success in the 1950s and early 1960s. However it should be clear from the foregoing discussion that the filibuster is not a relic of the Jim Crow era. In fact the continued existence of the filibuster owes nothing to race. It persists so that parties can’t parlay thin majorities (or in the present circumstances no Senate majority) into the enactment of sweeping society-transforming legislation.  Imagine what Donald Trump could have accomplished in 2017 absent the filibuster. Note as well that all or most of it would have been reversed absent the filibuster this year. That’s another argument in favor of the filibuster — it prevents wild oscillations in policy.  In sum Biden and Obama are being dishonest about the filibuster on two levels. Their historical claim is bogus and their opposition to the filibuster is inconsistent with their past positions on this practice.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
