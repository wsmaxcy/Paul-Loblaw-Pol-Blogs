C, Resistance Is For Now an Appropriate Response to the Possible Biden Presidency, The Heartland Institute, 2020-11-20, It’s hypocritical and sickening how so many politicians radical activists media personalities and talking heads are suddenly calling for “unity” in the aftermath of the still-being-contested presidential election. For instance former Vice-President Joe Biden who may be officially declared the next president of the United States at some point soon a determination state election official have yet to make at this point however is declaring he is president of all people and will take all their interests into account. He’s calling for unity. And while implying all those who voted for Donald Trump were liars racists and driven by hate and the desire for chaos Michelle Obama tweeted “We’ve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us.” And Whoopi Goldberg surely an expert on elections and politics says people should “suck it up” accept Biden’s premature coronation as a fact and fall into line. What’s sickening is that many of those calling for people to unify behind the progressive/socialist Biden/Harris presidential ticket have spent the past four years trying to overturn Trump’s legitimate election as president claiming he stole the election with the help of Russian interference. These brokers of unity have been promoting disunity for four years. They tried to overturn Trump’s election with a dossier bought and paid for by Democrats which falsely claimed Russian interference handed Trump the election. When that failed they tried to impeach Trump. And when that failed they took to the streets and rioted tore down statues defaced public buildings and monuments destroyed businesses and private property and attacked journalists who reported these incidents. None of these Democrats were calling for unity then. Why should people who radical progressives have for four years called names spat on and seen their lives and livelihoods destroyed by the inaction of Democratic mayors or the actions of Democratic governors and legislators now join hands with these self-same hateful people and sing Kumbaya? They shouldn’t! Biden and progressive Democrats have promised to push legislation or regulations to treat legally owned constitutionally protected semi-automatic rifles and handguns with high capacity magazines as if they were machine guns. Under Biden and company’s proposals those who own such firearms or magazines would be forced to submit to additional background checks pay a substantial fee for each of these items owned and would be unable to pass their firearms on to relatives as is legal now. If a person refuses to submit to this tyranny he or she would be branded a criminal in which case Biden and company led by his gun control guru failed senatorial and presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke would send federal agents to seize the guns. As O’Rourke said to Biden’s approval during the campaign “Hell yes we’re going to take your AR-15 your AK-47.” Now that’s certainly a unifying position meant to bring millions of gun owners into Biden’s big tent. RESIST! When Biden promises his public option health insurance program won’t cost people their private insurance remember this comes from a man who served under Barack Obama who promised under Obamacare if you like your doctor or health plan you can keep them. Subsequent events showed they lied. And Biden is lying now knowing when a public option is out there thousands or companies will drop their health insurance plans for employees allowing the federal government to pick up the tab instead. The only unity here is unifying misery as an increasing number of people are thrown into a government plan with long-wait periods and limited options. If you like your insurance and the quality of health care it provides you RESIST. When Biden promises good jobs and cheap energy as he shuts down the use of abundant inexpensive and reliable fossil fuels to provide electricity and power cars fight back. Look to California’s and Europe’s experiences with high costs and repeated rolling blackouts because that’s the energy plan Biden and the Democratic political machine are pushing. Policies that reward politically connected green energy companies and environmental dictators while punishing the poor the middle class blue collar workers and retirees. Don’t let Biden take your SUV or truck which can haul a camper or a boat and carry and entire baseball hockey or soccer team to the game or practice and force you into compact fuel efficient vehicle that can do none of those things. Government has no business mandating what type of air conditioners dishwashers furnaces insulation light bulbs shower heads stoves toilets washing machines and windows we use in our homes. If you want a gas stove a high flow shower head and incandescent light bulb without checking with the nanny state for permission RESIST. I know of very few people who believe as Biden and his ilk do that the federal government should dictate what children learn in school. Sorry no unifying theme there. Federal standards which teach kids what to think about American history climate change the legitimate role of government in our lives and the status of modern race and sexual relations for example not how to think about these controversial matters are antithetical to our federalist system which recognizes states localities and yes even parents as those authorities best suited to make such decisions for their children. RESIST the federalization of public education. For four years Democrats have resisted not unified: supporting rioters undermining public safety by hamstringing police attempting to stymie President Trump’s efforts to put America first by advancing U.S. geopolitical and commercial interests abroad and our energy and economic security at home. Accordingly it rings hollow for these hypocrites now that they think they are in power to call for unity telling the half of the country who supported Trump to settle down and shut up. To paraphrase the immortal words of Founding Father and patriot Patrick Henry “Gentlemen may cry unity unity – but there is no unity. … I know not what course others may take; but as for me give me liberty or I will RESIST!” H.
