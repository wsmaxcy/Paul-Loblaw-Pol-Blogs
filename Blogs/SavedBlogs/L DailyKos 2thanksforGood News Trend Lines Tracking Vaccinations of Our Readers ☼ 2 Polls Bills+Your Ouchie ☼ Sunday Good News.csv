L, Trend Lines: Tracking Vaccinations of Our Readers ☼ 2 Polls: Bill's+Your Ouchie? ☼ Sunday Good News, 2thanksforGood News, 2021-05-02, Good News: We bring it we make it. This week I’m uplifting two recent Roundup writers chloris creator and nifty with quotes from their introductions:  The Good Gnus group is a community of readers writers activists supporters community builders and patriots. We begin gathering every day at 7 a.m. ET to celebrate national good news. Our most active members are of course a subgroup of members of Daily Kos whose Front Pages celebrate “News Community Action.” However you don’t have to be a member of Daily Kos to be a Gnusie. We are realists not fools idiots or ostriches. We know we live in a world where active nefarious and evil decision-makers do very bad things and create stress and anxiety in us our loved ones our friends our neighbors our allies and destroy people and systems we hold dear. However we choose to focus on the good news that people create around the country. Sometimes we create Good News. Together we are strong and resilient. We return regularly to these pages to revitalize. In a Good News Roundup the weight of bearing good news is not borne by the author alone: Gnusies can be counted on to adorn the comment section with good news. Often commenters create three times as many comments as Recommendations! If you cannot linger with us for hours I recommend you return in the mid or late afternoon learn who your favorite commenters are and Search for their names on return visits. We count on certain favorite Gnusies to bless us in the comments with humor hope history and analysis every day.  Since February 21 2021 I’ve been asking readers every Sunday to respond this question: What is your vaccination status? I’m pleased to present the results of that polling here and I am very grateful to those readers and members of Daily Kos who have chosen to get vaccinated and participate in the poll every week. I know many agree with me: I’m very pleased to see these Gnusie trends!

Kerry Eleveld Daily Kos: One hundred days into Joe Biden's presidency everyone living in a reality-based world is getting the sense that the 46th president of the United States might be on the way to making history.  The potential for Biden to enact historic change has been fueled by a confluence of factors including a catastrophic pandemic that has arguably become the nation's deadliest public health crisis in a century and has devastated the economy in the process. The pandemic along with the advent of several highly effective vaccines provided Biden with an opportunity to not only help stem the spread of the virus but to restore public faith in the ability of the federal government to respond to a nation in need. Biden has met that challenge receiving his highest marks in nearly every reputable poll for his handling of the pandemic and also winning support from roughly two-thirds of the country for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. At the same time Biden's competent pandemic response has helped lift his handling of the economy to majority support that rivals Trump's numbers even at his apex.  Image:  President Joe Biden arrives to speak about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27 2021 in Washington DC.

Madam speaker madam vice president. No president has ever said those words from this podium. No president has ever said those words and it's about time.  Weird viral DNA spills secrets to biologists Ewen Callaway Nature: Bacteria-infecting viruses have specialized enzymes to make genes with alternative nucleobase.  ‘Alien’ genomes can be found on Earth. Some viruses that infect bacteria use an alternative genetic alphabet that’s distinct from the code used by nearly all other organisms — and now two teams have spelt out how the system works. More than four decades in the making the studies show how dozens of these bacteriophages (or just ‘phages’) as they are known write their genomes using a chemical base called 2-aminoadenine Z for short instead of adenine — the A in the As Ts Cs and Gs of genetics textbooks.

And renewable energy becomes more efficient every day. That we are living in science fiction was brought home to me last week when I put down Kim Stanley Robinson’s superb climate-futures novel The Ministry for the Future and picked up Bill McKibben’s New Yorker letter on climate warning of the melting of the Thwaites Glacier “already known as the ‘doomsday glacier’ because its collapse could raise global sea levels by as much as three feet”. Where we are now would have seemed like science fiction itself 20 years ago; where we need to be will take us deeper into that territory. Three things matter for climate chaos and our response to it – the science reporting on current and potential conditions the technology offering solutions and the organizing which is shifting perspectives and policy. Each is advancing rapidly. The science mostly gives us terrifying news of more melting more storms more droughts more fires more famines. But the technological solutions and the success of the organizing to address this largest of all crises have likewise grown by leaps and bounds. For example ideas put forth in the Green New Deal in 2019 seen as radical at the time are now the kind of stuff President Biden routinely proposes in his infrastructure and jobs plans. It’s not easy to see all the changes – you have to be a wonk to follow the details on new battery storage solutions or the growth of solar power in cheapness proliferation efficiency and possibility or new understanding about agriculture and soil management to enhance carbon sequestration. You have to be a policy nerd to keep track of the countless new initiatives around the world.   Jennifer Jacobs: White House compiles report that says of Biden's 1500 admin appointees:—58% are women—18% Black—15% Hispanic—15% Asian American or Pacific Islander—3% Middle Eastern or North African—2% American Indian or Alaska Native—14% LGBTQ+—4% are veterans—3% have a disability.

On Daily Kos:  We welcome comments in Roundups every day regarding: In my Sunday smorgasbord Roundups I especially welcome the following types of comments: Top Image: Starhawk created this diary’s top image of the rampant gnu and gave it to the members of the Good News Roundup group (Gnusies)! Thank you Starhawk! This is a quite detailed sketch of a gnu drawn in brown green and black. A happy and dynamic gnu dances on its left hind leg in a classic rampant heraldric pose. Joyful letters prance above and behind the mane: “Happy Dance.” Signature: Nick Korolev 2021.

For 3-1/2 years we’ve shared positive news laughed organized resisted rebelled revolted without being revolting relied rested mentored created crossed rivers chewed our cud puffed methane out both ends and laughed. Here’s looking at you kid and standing upwind! As always please share more Good News than I can find or provide.  This is a group diary and by my power I declare this Good Gnus Salo(o)n open! Let the good-news sharing and community building begin! Power with not power over ❤️ ✊ ❤️ 2thanks (he him)   If you enjoy my work on Daily Kos I’d appreciate a gnusie bump large or small via PayPal or CashApp ($ipaywill). Gifts from supportive Kosacks help me pay for my wife’s medicines. If you’ve sent me a gift already I am 2thankful!   .  . I’m keen to track our vaccinations because I think our trends might encourage slow-to-decide readers to get vaccinated. Of course the median age of Daily Kos readers is greater than the median age of Americans and therefore we will receive our vaccinations before most Americans.
