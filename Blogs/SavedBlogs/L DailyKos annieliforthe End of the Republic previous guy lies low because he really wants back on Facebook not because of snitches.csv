L, previous guy lies low because he really wants back on Facebook not because of snitches, annieliforthe End of the Republic, 2021-04-29, Previous guy always expects the loyalty of mob silence Omertà even when he throws everyone under the bus it’s part of his personality disorder. The real goal for his relative silence might be the return to social media when Facebook reconsiders their suspension. He has a Parler account but doesn’t use it and he could easily try to be on Twitch or Telegram but perhaps that’s for when the Feds or NY state get closer to prosecution.  World leaders brace for historic Trump Facebook ban decision https://t.co/JgFFMolfpO Why it matters: The decision will set a historic precedent for how the tech giant treats accounts of world leaders and could be a litmus test for the board’s power. Context: Details: "I'm less concerned about the fate of Donald Trump as much as I am about the precedent that this is setting for the removal and de-platforming of everyone else" Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told Axios. www.axios.com/… This is one of those stories so good that I'm jealous I didn't think of it.Trump's dead Facebook page as a makeshift and living memorial. Great find from @_B_Contreras_:https://t.co/xZ1gDpDgOe Trump may still eventually return to the page: After enacting the initial ban Facebook gave its independent Oversight Board the task of deciding whether he’ll ever be allowed back. But that decision hasn’t been made yet and until it is Trump’s page is effectively open to everyone in the world except Trump himself (along with Trump ally Roger Stone and others who have received permanent bans). So now in lieu of new posts to argue over the legions of #MAGA conservatives and #Resistance liberals that once duked it out in the comments below each presidential update are stuck piling in under that last Jan. 6 post. [...] “For those die-hard Trump fans and supporters this site can represent a location for a parasocial relationship … [or] a one-sided relationship” said Natalie Pennington an assistant professor of communication studies at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. “These people feel like they’re close to Trump even though they don’t know him which is why you see them commenting in a way that is directed at him as if he is the one that is reading and writing and responding — even though he’s obviously not responding since he’s banned.” Pennington’s research has explored how people engage with the Facebook accounts of their dead friends and family members. She noted parallels between that grief and what Trump’s most persistent Facebook fans express: “We don’t always have the closure we want or we have feelings that remain over time.… For people who were upset that Trump lost the election those feelings aren’t just going to go away four months later. And so the page becomes a place for them to continue those conversations amongst each other.” That behavior she said is an extension of older pre-internet forms of coping: visiting a gravesite for instance or attending a funeral. But for others commenting on a months-old post from a banned former president is a pale imitation of the direct line of communication with Trump that they used to have and want back. www.latimes.com/… Facebook's internal report on its role in Trump's insurrection has now been leaked online: report https://t.co/5t7sZGJe39  Trump-loving insurrectionist couple arrested for attacking Capitol police after leaving evidence all over Facebook https://t.co/7fxTZiM6bk  Facebook let Trump lie America into an insurrection. Will it stop other leaders from doing worse? https://t.co/MTkmAtQKvc  "Trump is now underground. This is similar to the early 1990s when he went bankrupt multiple times and his elite criminal friends were getting arrested. He laid low like a good mafioso does and that's what he's doing today." -- @gaslitnation https://t.co/NLiuovfPHW  "We're now playing Mini-Trump Whack-a-Mole. All of these far-right extremists in state legislatures gerrymandering our elections empowered by an extremely well-organized far-right propaganda empire." -- @AndreaChalupa on @gaslitnation https://t.co/NLiuovfPHW  Twitch Where Far-Right Influencers Feel at HomeBarred from Twitter and Facebook as Trump was social media’s younger conspiracy theorists are moving to Twitch.https://t.co/bADn7Cs6FV  *CBS News Poll of Speech Watchers*We interviewed watchers immediately after the speech. More than eight in 10 of those who watched approve of Biden’s speech.Most said it made them feel optimistic about America. pic.twitter.com/QOkI0PoVuo  Comedians don’t need an instruction manual for mocking the eminently mockable Biden; they just need an occasion. While the fall seen ’round the world definitely presented them with one it also highlighted why that opportunity didn’t drag on for very long as critics such as Donald Trump allege it would have had the fall happened to say Donald Trump. Biden apparently never felt the need to defend his precious vanity after a plurality of Americans witnessed him bust ass on that staircase over and over again like Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes. Either he knew that doing so would only further protract the story or he was more concerned with passing a massive infrastructure bill. The result is the same either way. In one fell swoop—emphasis on fell—Biden managed to further establish a contrast with his predecessor show some humility give comedians joke-ammunition for days and chip away at the myth of media favoritism. www.fastcompany.com/... I know Democrats get punched when they don’t take the high road but honestly Ds should take every opportunity to remind the country that Trump first put his idiot son-in-law in charge of responding to the pandemic then just gave up and let over 400k die. https://t.co/oPZZEscr8v   Trump on Fox: “Rudy Giuliani is a great patriot he does these things he just loves this country and they raid his apartment. It’s like so unfair and such a double standard ... like I don’t think anybody’s ever seen before.... I don’t know what they’re looking for”
