L, Your Human Rule of Claw Has A Plan To Earn Living Post Pandemic Needs Advice., Rule of Claw, 2021-05-03, I am going to do a newsletter.  Yes I have researched it.  I am aware nothing is easy and there are challenges as all projects present challenges.  This would focus on four cores:  1.  Original reporting.  2.  Stories that got lost in shuffles.  These would be important stories however not always glamourous ones.  Nuts and bolts stuff.  3.  Pooties and wuzzles.  Memes heroism inspiration.  4.  The future.  Each week would contain stories about progress and how we can create a cleaner world. My thought is to charge $3.99  per month for one newsletter per week.  I am not sure.  Some do free newsletters then try to affiliate for products but to me that does not seem fair to the reader.  The newsletter would be the product I don’t love advertising and I want you to be assured that if you communicate with me you are only communicating with me.  So of course I would focus on email compliance and privacy.  I want it to be enjoyable informative inspiring and even comical in appropriate spots.  I don’t want it to be dour and depressing. But I am out of ideas and need to earn again.  So I am soliciting advice on template design what you want to read what you believe a fair price is for four issues per month and anything else you believe would help. Thanks in advance. -ROC
