C, The Week in Pictures: Infrastructure Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-10, First an announcement: there won’t be an episode of the 3WHH podcast this week. Both Lucretia and I are traveling and we just don’t have the infrastructure to pull it off. What?—you say! Are we the only two Americans left out of Biden’s “infrastructure” bill? Apparently so. (Meanwhile if you’re still jonesing for a podcast fix I did another guest turn on the Ricochet podcast last night. Drinks were had. As you’ll be able to tell.)                                         Headlines of the week:                                                  And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
