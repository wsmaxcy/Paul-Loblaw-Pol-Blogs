L, Dear Senator Scott, wdrath, 2021-04-29, Dear Sen. Tim Scott: After seeing your “response” to President Biden’s joint address to Congress there’s a few bones that this fellow American citizen has to pick with you. First of all you claim that President Biden’s address to the nation will “pull this country further apart” and then say right afterwards that you won’t engage in “finger-pointing” (which is exactly what you did). You claim that President Biden was focused only on “platitudes” and should focus on policies yet he unlike your party has laid out specific legislation to accomplish his goals. You have the audacity to claim that this administration hasn’t been “following science” when on issue after issue from the pandemic to climate change it is in fact your party that has failed to do so. The Biden administration has been “following the science” on all of its Coronavirus policies unlike the previous administration (where were you when the head of your party suggested people could drink bleach to get rid of it for instance...one of the most irresponsible statements by a president in American history?) Your so-called “response” to President Biden was fraught with all kinds of misinformation and distortions. Such as: the Coronavirus bill passed by Congress earlier this year which is supported by a wide majority of the American public including many Republicans even as Republicans refused to even engage the President when he asked for their advice. And you then have the audacity to claim it’s President Biden who was being partisan when Republicans the party to which you belong have been engaged in hyper-partisanship for years. You claimed in your “response” to President Biden that he had supposedly “bragged” that the Coronavirus bill passed earlier this year was “the most liberal bill in American history.” He said no such thing either in his speech that you were allegedly “responding” to nor previously. You simply made that up out of whole cloth. And you say it’s President Biden who is being partisan?  You claim that only six percent of President Biden’s proposed American Jobs Plan (a very specific proposal including specific legislation)  goes to actual infrastructure like roads and bridges. At least 24 percent is for roads bridges and ports and more is for additional superstructure which could easily be considered part of our nation’s infrastructure (improving our nation’s homes and  rebuilding our electrical grid for instance) not to mention water pipes. So once again your so-called “response” to President Biden is not only not a true “response” but is factually incorrect. And when it comes to “packing the Supreme Court” another allegation you made in your so-called “response” to President Biden’s speech it is in fact Republicans who have been the ones who have gone way out of their way to bend the rules to their partisan wishes and pack the Supreme Court with at least two more extremely conservative judges. And in your so-called “response” to President Biden you insinuated that he had called you pejorative names such as “unlce Tom” and worse just because some other so-called “liberals” had alllegedly called you that at some unspecified point in time. Well President Biden never said that about you and your implication that he would condone such a thing from his fellow Democrats is insulating.  Then you go on to say in your alleged “response” to President Biden’s address that “America is not a racist country.” Well putting aside the question of whether America is now or has ever been a racist country guess what? President did not say that it is either in his address nor previously. In fact he said time and again that the goodness in his fellow American citizens far outweighs the bad. Then you criticize him for allegedly playing the race card which is exactly what you did in falsely implying that he said that this is a racist nation when he said no such thing. And then there’s the biggest doozie of all. You claim that Republicans have supposedly been trying to make it “easier to vote” when in fact all evidence shows the exact opposite. Efforts to purge voter rolls that primarily target certain voters (i.e. in heavily Democratic districts that happen to include a lot of people of color for instance) to create more obstacles for voters in those areas have been well documented (including reducing the number of polling places in “select” areas ending up with people waiting in line to vote for two three and four hours). Granted as a member of the Republican Party a federal elected official like yourself doesn’t want to admit to what members of your own party are doing in state after state. When it comes to which political party is doing more to make it hard for “certain” people to vote you are living in denial. In summary your so-called “response” to President Biden’s address was nothing of the sort. It was by and large a hyper-partisan screed filled with blatant distortions from the outset (not the least of which being that you actually “responded” to anything President Biden actually talked about in your so-called “response.”)
