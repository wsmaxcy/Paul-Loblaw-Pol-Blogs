L, Bookchat: Lodes of Time, Clio2forReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-06-30, Welcome to Bookchat where you can talk about anything ... books plays essays and audiobooks. You don’t have to be reading a book to come in sit down and chat with us. “As many as you’ll find in the garden catalog” said the Natterjack. “And now” it added with a yawn “it’s nap time.” And it shut its eyes and would say no more no matter how hard Elizabeth poked it.  --Edward Eager The Time Garden (1959)   Books are stuffed with the scents of time.   No narrative can be a narrative without time holding it together. Though stitchwork varies infinitely: authors make time skip slow fragment speed up circle back hold very nearly still.  Non-fiction authors ponder time analyze it document it reason and speculate psychologize and philosophize about it. Describe its place in human history and vice versa. Poets personify defy it.  Time might pace evenly as a pendulum amble stretch or squeeze. Divide into parallel strands rejoin. Time can be rhythm a prison sentence a train that halts at certain stations a landscape a caesura. Characters angst under the crush of time or gallop free within it. Endure it and survive or not. Race against it. Misuse it. Refind it in a scalloped madeleine. Book after book some characters persist untouched by time while their world morphs around them. Others surf time’s waves. Books preserve word-patterns set a few months back or a hundred years ago or somehow surviving nearly intact through alterations of media during three thousand revolutions of the earth about the sun. Antique volumes brush us with the ghostly touch of hands that typeset bound them sold rejected stole leafed through.  All books take time to read. In doing which we may lose track of time. In time we change and alter too in our relations with books. Perhaps what pleased us once no longer does. Perhaps we find ourselves surprised face to face with our own reflection in a swathe of words that once seemed opaque. Books that were old friends might embarrass us today. Or their language may spall off fresh layers of luminescence under our time-richened scrutiny. To some books time is kind. Others dissove in it as if in acid. Formerly famous tomes once shrined in a million bookcases come to be ridiculed scorned pilloried shredded. Fragments survive of certain works only in quotes set like jewels into newer books. A few out of all the legions perpetually sinking into obscurity may find sudden rescue reincarnation in fresh bindings archival paper critical editions. In the nick of time. time (n.) Old English tima “limited space of time” from Proto-Germanic *timon- “time” (source also of Old Norse timi ”time proper time” Swedish timme “an hour”) from PIE [proto-Indo-European] *di-mon- suffixed form of root *da- ”to divide.” Abstract sense of “time as an indefinite continuous duration” is recorded from late 14c. Personified at least since 1509 as an aged bald man (but with a forelock) carrying a scythe and an hourglass.  Has our sense of time itself changed? Have books changed it? Even within our lifetime has time become less linear as writer and painter Rabih Alameddin mused in 2002? *** What are you reading now or what have you read or what books might your future hold? In homage to cfk’s tradition a poll at the end offers a list of books whose titles contain titles the word “time.” They’re somewhat arbitrary and in no particular order. Some I’ve read others only heard about and a couple came from social-media listicles so the mere presence of a title is not endorsement! A few may be obscure to you dear reader; I hardly know which but a handful of thumbnail introductions might be helpful to some: An Experiment With Time by J.W. Dunne (1927) was speculative nonfiction. Dunne began with an observation that his own dreams often seemed to contain minor precognitive elements mixed with fragmentary memories. He conducted a series of “experiments” in dreaming and trance states by himself and with others worked out what might be called a theory of meta-time and presented an argument for the immortality of consciousness. While critics have knocked expectable holes in his specifics Dunne’s book was a best-seller in his day and has influenced speculative fiction down to our own. (Wikipedia including a catalogue of authors influenced — Tolkein among them.)  The Time Garden by Edward Eager (1959). Eager’s fantasies for children followed the earlier model of E. Nesbit. Four youngsters spend the summer in a historic New England house. The different thyme varieties in its formal garden transport them to adventures in the past with a talking toad as guide. Though charming in concept (and my header quote comes from it) this once-loved tale is sadly marred by several tropes that stand out now as racist cliches.  Time and the River Flowing by Francois Leydet (1964). The Grand Canyon in history geology conservation pictures. Part of the Sierra Club’s classic series.  Time and Again by Jack Finney (1970). Premise: the U.S. Army experiments with sending people back in time using self-hypnosis. The protagonist and his girlfriend investigate a mysterious letter mailed in New York City in 1882. Stephen King has called the novel “in this writer’s opinion the great time travel story.” Carl Sagan praised its “taut” structure and convincing historical texture. Actual historical illustrations. Wikipedia (warning spoilers). The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl by Timothy Egan (2006). The comprehensive story of an environmental disaster. National Book Award for Nonfiction among other prizes. Review in Smithsonian magazine. The Thief of Time by John Boyne (2007). “It is 1758 and Matthieu Zela is fleeing Paris after witnessing the murder of his mother and his stepfather’s execution...[B]efore the eighteenth century ends he discovers that his body has stopped aging. At the...age of 256 he is suddenly forced to answer...: what is the worth of immortality without love?” A Tale For the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki (2013). As described by Nanny Ogg here in Bookchat on June 2: ...about a woman in British Columbia who finds a diary in a lunchbox that washes up on the shore. The diary is in Japanese and she gets it translated so we begin to find out about the life of the lonely Japanese girl who wrote it. Though never specified the feeling is that the lunchbox washed out to sea during the tsunami that destroyed Fukushima... The translation arrives in installments there’s a mystery and as well a “quantum physics and space time continuum aspect” Nanny Ogg reports. Finalist for both the Man Booker and Pulitzer prizes. Swing Time by Zadie Smith (2016). Two mixed-race English girls first meet in a London dance class. The tale “unspools moving rapidly back and forth” between past and present London and west Africa and New York as their complex paths contrast and intertwine throughout life.
