L, YIKES! Trump Goes TOTALLY BONKERS Berating Bill Barr Over the 'Bullsh--' Bombshell, News Corpse, 2021-06-28, Donald Trump's wrath is as predictable as the sun setting in the west. And on Sunday night the sun set on Trump whining petulantly about reports that his Attorney Genuflect Bill Barr confessed that "We realized from the beginning it was just bullsh--." He was talking about the "Big Lie" that the 2020 presidential election was rife with fraud and had been stolen from Trump Never mind that Barr was an active participant in that campaign of self-serving and evidence-free lies. And now his futile attempt to rehabilitate his shattered reputation has triggered his former boss. Trump issued a statement (posted below) lambasting "RINO former Attorney General Bill Barr" because he "failed to investigate election fraud and really let down the American people." Trump cited as an example Barr's neglect to do anything about "the scam that took place in Georgia of ballot stuffing on camera." Which of course never happened and for which no video exists. Trump also wondered why "If there was no fraud why are Arizona Georgia Wisconsin Pennsylvania and other States spending so much time and effort on exposing the fraud?" The all-too-apparent answer is that it's only delusional and ultra-partisan Republicans wasting time on such nonsense. And they have to date exposed precisely nothing. Although Trump and his disgraced attorney Rudy Giuliani have lost some sixty court cases attempting to materialize his phantom claims of fraud. Whereupon Trump itemized a list of alleged voting irregularities that he says "we already know" but that share the distinctive characteristic of being utterly fictional. They include the purging of "101789 “obsolete” voters" who by definition didn't vote at all; "Thousands of ballots 'wheeled in through the back door'" that exist only in his warped imagination; "Illegal alien votes" that occurred in tiny numbers and most often inadvertently; "Election law changes" that supposedly violated some imaginary clause in the Constitution; And as Trump says "much more." And all of it flagrantly false. Trump implied that Barr is lying now because he previously praised Trump in his pro forma resignation letter. However Trump doesn't entertain the possibility that Barr is telling the truth now and was lying back then to beat a hasty retreat from a sinking ship. Either way Barr cannot be considered trustworthy. And the same goes for GOP Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell who Trump chastises as a "spineless RINO." Trump sets up his conclusion by expressing his "disappointment in every sense of the word" for the man he hired to lead the Justice Department into disrepute. Plus Trump demonstrates that he has no idea what the job of Attorney General entails. Suggesting that he thinks the AG represents him personally and is subject to attorney/client privilege Trump complains that Barr "shouldn’t be speaking about the President." Then Trump alleges that Barr who was the most conflicted and partisan AG in modern history had actually been working to quash the investigations that Trump wanted him to pursue when in fact Barr was the driving force behind such probes. Trump finally closes saying that "Bill Barr’s weakness helped facilitate the cover-up of the Crime of the Century the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election." Which is actually true but not for any of the reasons that Trump thinks it is. Barr was a proponent of the "Big Lie" that triggered Trump's insurrection on Capitol Hill on January 6th. He advanced Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in defiance of the will of the people. And despite Trump's infantile whining and insults he and Barr will go down in history together as traitors to their nation and to democracy. NEW: President Trump Releases Statement; Unleashes on Fmr.
