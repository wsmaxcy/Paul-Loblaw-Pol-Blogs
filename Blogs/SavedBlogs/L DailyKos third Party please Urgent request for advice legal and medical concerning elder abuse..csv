L, Urgent request for advice legal and medical concerning elder abuse., third Party please, 2021-07-03, I just learned of an horrific new facet in the treatment of a elderly widow and am hoping that someone in the community can help with some advice. I can’t really make this long story too short but I will try to pare it down… I have a friend of over 55 years “Martha” who is a health professional. She provides in-home care and services. She is not a nurse but she does have medical backup in case they are needed in her business. Apart from her primary job she has cared for some sick (disabled paralyzed) and elderly people in their homes over the years. She charges very little IMO for her services and can always use some extra $$. When an old acquaintance “Susan” contacted her some months ago she agreed to schedule hours of care for Susan’s client. The client “Sarah” is a ninety-something yo widow who had no children and has had no contact with her sister for quite a few years. Their estrangement was over an argument or something between their spouses. Sarah is quite comfortable financially and has been able to afford in-home private care for the last few years.  Approximately 4 years ago Susan got involved with Sarah’s care. I don’t know what crisis Sarah may have been going through at that time but Susan has done some very shady things. My friend Martha is now scared for Sarah’s welfare… The facts:*At least two years ago Susan had Sarah give Susan Power of Attorney.*Within the last year Susan brought a lawyer and had Sarah consent to having her will updated. The new will leaves everything to Susan. *Susan called for hospice care for Sarah and Sarah has been declared non compos mentis.*Sarah is somehow classified as being near death and all of her medications (heart blood pressure etc...) have been stopped. She is only prescribed “comfort” meds like morphine and ? that she does not need and has not been given. Susan took Sarah’s check book and some valuable diamond jewelry recently.Sarah who had always handled her own finances demanded her check book back so that she could understand where all the money was going. As I said my friend is not just concerned she is scared for Sarah’s wellbeing.  Susan does not hide her greed for her inheritance. She gets paid and has already been given money and a car. When Sarah had a mild cold and cough Susan called Martha. She said “Doesn’t she have pneumonia?” Martha got the distinct impression that Susan was disappointed that Sarah was improving. Where we’re at: Martha contacted a medical doctor friend in another state. He told her that the outlook is bleak. Once declared incapable hospice follows the direction of the patient’s Power of Atty. How can they declare that a patient’s medications should stop!!! Sarah is completely aware of what is going on and is extremely upset. I am tempted to contact elder abuse to see what can be done. This morning I got Sarah’s sister and nephew’s phone numbers. They are in another state too. Sarah wants to redo her will and name her family as heirs. Martha is afraid to come forward personally because she is worried about what Susan will do. She’s pretty sure that Susan will fire her as a care giver. The ONLY care giver who provides physical therapy reading creating such wonderful food that Sarah finally started really eating again. Martha wants to contact the family Sarah’s sister is older than she is. Martha hopes that the nephew will come forward to help. But how to help??? I have been sick at heart since Martha contacted me this morning. I care about Sarah since I’ve heard all about her great improvements physically and in her outlook. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the length and any formatting errors. First diary for me.
