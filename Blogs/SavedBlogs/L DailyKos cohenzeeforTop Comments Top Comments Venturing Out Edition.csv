L, Top Comments: Venturing Out Edition, cohenzeeforTop Comments, 2021-04-27, As I have previously written I became fully vaccinated earlier this month. The last couple of weeks I have gone to Atlantic City with a family member who likes to gamble. I am not much of a gambler anymore but it is nice to go since I don’t have to pay for anything while I am there. After being in a near complete lockdown since early October it was nice to get out. One bonus is I get to get a free Krispy Kreme. The closest one to me either in Manhattan or about 1 hour east of me. Krispy Kreme isn’t really my thing but free is free. I was still very cautious when I was down there. I wore my mask every time I left my room and only ate or drank either outside or in the room. Since people are allowed to drink while gambling I changed locations whenever someone near me was unmasked. There is still some distancing between machines and all table games have plenty of plexiglass dividing everyone from each other. I try to time my rare gambling sessions to when there is likely to be less people in the casino so mostly mornings or midday. For those of you vaccinated have you been venturing out more?
