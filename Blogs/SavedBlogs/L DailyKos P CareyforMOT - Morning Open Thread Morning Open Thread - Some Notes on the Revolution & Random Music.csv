In the Midst of the Revolution This morning is clear with a slight chill in the air but my coffee is dark and warm. An email exchange I had last week about gender-bias in scientific studies and the fundamental inadequacies of so many of our governmental institutions got me thinking about social revolutions. And watching this latest Administration actually put forward a few progressive policies has injected a bit of optimism in my morning joe. Back in the early 90s I was in Boston for a summer on a sort of self-imposed sabbatical when I was invited to take part in a small but formal seminar being directed by Roberto Unger. I was familiar with Professor Unger’s work and had slogged through several of his books but mostly I was interested in his work on critical legal studies and welcomed the opportunity to sit in and listen to someone I viewed as one of the founding fathers of that movement. I know he's been labeled a radical Marxist (and even worse things I'm sure) but he is actually more of a dreamer. He was always well dressed with small wire-framed glasses of Brazilian hue and accent and possessed a great intensity about him even when he was listening; he had what I call a seductive intellect. That summer—living in a third-floor walk-up on Newbury Street drinking too much coffee and delving deeply into social history and legal philosophy—was an important chapter in my life. The work I was most familiar with was his dissection of legal structures in relation to social institutions (the structure of courts and judges and laws) but mostly what we discussed was our deep and basic understanding of the structures of democracies and the potential—by abandoning our preconceived notions of the present structures as inviolable—to create new norms through open institutions. We were challenged to think of societies where individuals and groups were empowered enough to transform those political economic and social structures we had come to believe sacrosanct. In a word: revolution. If nothing else that summer he taught me to envision entire social and legal structures as malleable and capable of change when we can refocus fundamental expectations of society. Truly what is government for and how do we want it to function? Remember these were the Clinton years—when we had such promise and in my opinion failed so miserably.  Years later in June of 2012 Professor Unger released an eight-and-a-half-minute YouTube video entitled “Beyond Obama” in which he delivers a radical critique of the then-current political landscape and strongly calls for both a progressive takeover of the Democratic Party and President Obama’s defeat in his upcoming election for a second term. Well he hadn’t changed much in the intervening years. As noted at the time in Possible Futures The message was delivered from the far left of the president and the program espoused implies nothing short of a fundamental rethinking and reformulation of our social political and economic institutions. It is no wonder that both Democrats and Republicans were bewildered. What has been somewhat surprising however is the failure of progressives to engage with this imperative to drop the false hope of a lesser of two evils and develop a real progressive program that expands economic and educational opportunities to empower regular men and women.  In my brief life I’ve witnessed a number of revolutions small perhaps but important ones. Yet I can’t but see that we have so far to go and so much to accomplish before we can turn our faces to the rising sun and enjoy a moment of reflection and ease. We’ve ridden a popular uprising that forced out a sitting President and ended a war; we’ve opened our eyes to the the right of women to chose and be heard; we’ve witnessed the sacrifice of so many to secure the vote of our brothers and sisters; we’ve instituted a constitutional law that reaches state actors and we’ve expanded the boundaries of love through the freedom to marry. And yet as with most revolutions we’ve lost a few battles as well: foolish and egotistical wars of infinite folly a misogynistic backlash on women driven by fear and ignorance judicial assaults on the right to be counted at the ballot box a loss of personal privacy the sanctioning of monied influence in our political contests and an exuberant and sustained attack on the middle and lower classes by those very institutions we created to benefit the common weal. I live under no illusion that the Republican Party is imploding and in disarray or on the verge of dissolving or essentially dead. It is very much alive and doing well and will be a political force in the next local and state and national election. And the next and the next. I’ve never hid my feeling that we didn’t get enough done under President Obama and—I’ll be honest here—I wasn’t overly hopeful once President Biden was sworn in. But I was wrong. While every step we are trying to take is attacked by the minority party and the Democrats are still refusing to reform the filibuster I have a hope that we will be taking steps toward a more progressive society. Funny thing is that when Obama was elected I sort of had the feeling we would be doing this with arms locked and all smiles moving forward. After the last 12 years I know that this won’t be a bipartisan move toward a better incarnation of American Society; this will be a fight every damned step of the way. So be it. No one ever said the struggle for a better society was going to be brief or painless; still I’m more hopeful about this country than I have been in a while. I don’t feel so much like a person at a crossroads but more like someone on a different trajectory—one that began that one summer those many years ago. ❧       ❧ ☕️ Grab your coffee or tea and join us please.
