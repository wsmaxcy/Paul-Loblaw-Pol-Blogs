L, Liveblog I:  Closing Arguments -- the Chauvin Murder Trial, gchaucer2forCommunity Live Bloggers, 2021-04-19, Good morning everyone.  I hope you had a restful weekend.  I’m not sure if I could if I were on the jury.  I don’t know MN law but generally there are no time limits other than those self-imposed on closing arguments.  The prosecution had far more witnesses but had a memorable progression for when they testified and how testimony built for reinforcement.  The defense on the other hand had dreadful witnesses with a hodgepodge of testimony culminating in two unimpressive “experts.”  When I write unimpressive I am not speaking to credentials; rather their testimony and demeanor. The prosecution is also allowed time for rebuttal after the defense’s conclusion.  The defense is not provided the same opportunity. One issue regarding the jury.  They were not sequestered over the weekend.  Even if they managed to avoid all coverage of the trial they definitely won’t miss the virtual shut down of Minneapolis and LEO presence on their way to the courthouse.   Thanks again to belinda ridgewood for updating the links.  She never sleeps.
