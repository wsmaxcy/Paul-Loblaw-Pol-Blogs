L, Toward Nuclear Arms Control, jasonsibert, 2021-04-19, In the first months of President Barack Obama’s term he spoke on his views of nuclear arms control.   “[A]s a nuclear power as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon the United States has a moral responsibility to act” Obama said. “We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone but we can lead it we can start it. So today I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.”   Barely recognized at the time President Ronald Reagan a different type of president came to a similar conclusion in the 1980’s. It must be added that Reagan came to this conclusion after the Nuclear Freeze Movement a renewal of the spirit of detente with the Soviet Union (due to the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev) and advocacy of the Star Wars missile defense system (opposed by the scientific community because it’s not scientifically viable).    Obama’s advocacy of nuclear arms control won him the Nobel Peace Prize a year later. Obama said the goal would not be easy and “will not be reached quickly – not in my lifetime.” The president did pass the New START Treaty and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action during his term. New START and JCPOA did much in terms of making the world safer from the dangers of a nuclear arms race. President Donald Trump representing a strange fusion of nationalism and isolationism did everything he could to sabotage the whole idea of arms control.   President Joe Biden Obama’s vice-president has embraced the Obama arms control legacy by renewing New START and promising to return to the JCPOA. The new president must move quickly on JCPOA as there are early signs of Iran returning to the deal. Biden must also fight the Pentagon’s nuclear weapons modernization plan. William Hartung stated why the president should fight the fight for nuclear arms control in his story “Biden Can Make History on Nuclear Arms Reduction: “he (Biden) should cancel the plan to spend $264 billion to develop build and operate a new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).  Canceling the new ICBM would be good politics as well as good policy. A poll carried out by ReThink Media on behalf of the Federation of American Scientists found that 60 percent of Americans favored either forgoing the development of a new ICBM eliminating ICBMs or eliminating all nuclear weapons. As former Secretary of Defense William Perry has noted ICBMs are ‘some of the most dangerous weapons in the world’ because the president would have just a matter of minutes to decide whether to launch them in a crisis greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm.”  Where can the money be spent if we embrace arms control as a method of security? Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) are co-sponsoring a bill – the “Investing in Cures Before Missiles (ICBM) Act” – that would take funds slated for the new ICBM and invest them instead in efforts to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine.
