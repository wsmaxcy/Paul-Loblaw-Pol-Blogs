L, Fox Plans New Weather Channel And Criticism Jokes Rain Down, Lee Moran, 2021-07-07, Media baron Rupert Murdoch is jumping into the weather forecasting game with a new channel Fox Weather to debut later this year The New York Times reported﻿. And people have concerns given the right-wing spin of Murdoch’s other Fox outlets — in particular Fox News ― whose personalities have often denied the very existence of the climate crisis itself.
