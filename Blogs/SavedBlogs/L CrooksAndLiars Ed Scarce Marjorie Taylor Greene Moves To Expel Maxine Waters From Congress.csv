L, Marjorie Taylor Greene Moves To Expel Maxine Waters From Congress, Ed Scarce, 04-19-21, Besides the usual dumbells Greene's resolution if it ever comes will get almost no support and go nowhere for trying to expel the 30-year incumbent. But such stuff does get into the mainstream media and will help Greene raise ever more cash so much so that she raised a staggering $3.2mil in the first quarter of this year alone. And that's really what stunts like this are about raising cash that she'll never need in an overwhelmingly Republican district (R+28) and raising her profile so her poisonous ideas get mainstream overage. Source: Fox News Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-G announced an effort Sunday to expel Rep. Maxine Waters from Congress after she told protesters in Minnesota to "get more confrontational" if Derek Chauvin isn't convicted of murdering George Floyd. In a statement released by her office Taylor Greene accused the California Congresswoman of inciting "Black Lives Matter domestic terrorists to fire gunshots at National Guardsmen in Minnesota" after she spoke in Brooklyn Center which has become a flashpoint for protests following the fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright.  "I'll be introducing a resolution to expel Rep. Maxine Waters from Congress for her continual incitement of violence" a statement from Taylor Greene's office reads. Waters told reporters on Saturday that if former police officer Chauvin isn't found guilty of murdering Floyd "We've got to stay on the street and we've got to get more active we've got to get more confrontational. We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business." Nice spin Fox. She also said that she is "going to fight with all of the people who stand for justice" adding "We’ve got to get justice in this country and we cannot allow these killings to continue." Greene's other competitor for worst person in Congress chirped in with this one. Why is Maxine Waters traveling to a different state trying to incite a riot? What good can come from this? https://t.co/nXzV0trmN3 — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) April 18 2021 And even Kevin McCarthy got in on the foolishness. Maxine Waters is inciting violence in Minneapolis — just as she has incited it in the past. If Speaker Pelosi doesn’t act against this dangerous rhetoric I will bring action this week. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) April 19 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
