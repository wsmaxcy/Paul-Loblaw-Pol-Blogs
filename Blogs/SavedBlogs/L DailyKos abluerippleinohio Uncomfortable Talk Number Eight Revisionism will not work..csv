L, Uncomfortable Talk Number Eight: Revisionism will not work., abluerippleinohio, 2021-05-11,    I started with these videos because apparently the truth how brutal chattel slavery is has triggered some members of the Republican Party. It's like telling someone the truth about their loved ones and you begin to see the fingers going in their ears blocking the truth from going in the brain. Let's talk about 2 Oregon police officers being charged with beating a Black Lives Matter flag on someone else's property. How fragile do you have to be to destroy property that's not your own because you don't like Black Lives Matter? Better yet why are you law enforcement officers knowing you may have to work with people who want to hold rogue law enforcement officers accountable? And NO you don't get to play victim spread disinformation because you don't like the organization Black Lives Matter. You don't get to surveil Black people because Black people minding their own business looks "suspect" to you. And speaking of fragility Governor Kevin Stitt from Oklahoma just signed and anti critical race theory bill into law.  Here's an excerpt from The Root explaining why this happened. On Friday the same governor signed into law a bill that prohibits K-12 schools from teaching any race-based curriculum that causes “discomfort guilt anguish or psychological distress” to students. In other words it’s a law that protects white students from white fragility by banning any subject that forces them to think critically about American racism past present or future. But the signing of this bill isn't going unnoticed and not without consequences. Now the Black Wall Street Times “a black-owned and operated media news company” according to KFOR 4 is calling for the governor of white tears to be removed from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission because clearly Governor “Never Forget” would rather educators and students forget that America being America is how the mass murder of Black people in Tulsa happened in the first place. Brad Little governor of Idaho signs bill restricting critical race theory from bring taught in schools and universities. So let me take a wild guess here; talking about chattel slavery the Middle Passage slavery castles in Africa peonage sharecropping plaçage colorism white supremacy eugenics tokenism performative ally ship concubinage and atrocities can't be talked about in our universities and colleges because it "hurts" people's feelings? Or could it be that the truth isn't what was taught in schools and it really blows their minds how really revised the accounts of how brutal slavery was? Either way the truth is the truth! No amount of revisionism can absolve just how truly brutal chattel slavery race riots and bombings were.
