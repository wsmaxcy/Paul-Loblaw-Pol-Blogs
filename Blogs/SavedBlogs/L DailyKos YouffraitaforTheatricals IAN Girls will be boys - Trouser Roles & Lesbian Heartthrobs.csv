L, IAN: "Girls will be boys" - Trouser Roles & Lesbian Heartthrobs, YouffraitaforTheatricals, 2021-06-27, Drag King shows exist but are nowhere near as established or popular as those featuring men in drag. For that we must go to the theater. One of the most famous trouser roles is that of Prince Orlofsky (Brigitte Fassbaender) who throws the party in Die Fledermaus. In the ballroom of Prince Orlofsky’s villa the guests gossip about their host who has a habit of paying someone to try to make him laugh—usually in vain. Orlofsky doubts that Falke’s promised evening of entertainment will brighten his spirits but proclaims his guests should behave however they want and do anything they like. www.metopera.org/...

Cherubino the young page (Isabel Leonard) sings a love song in The Marriage of Figaro:  From Der Rosenkavalier with Anne Sophie von Otter as Octavian and Barbara Bonney as Sophie. On the morning of her engagement Sophie excitedly awaits the arrival of the cavalier of the rose. Octavian enters and presents her with the silver rose on behalf of the Baron. Sophie accepts enraptured and the two young people feel an instant attraction to each other. www.metopera.org/...   Ascanio (Michèle Losier) from Les Troyens: Ascanio is a funny guy...Here he tries to sort out his feelings over the latest series of events and imitates the conversation between Cellini and the Pope. He's amused he's bored he's confused...and like all good trouser roles his outlet is music.Treat yourself to Losier's hilarious portrayal from the delightful Amsterdam 2017 production of Benvenuto Cellini. Typically I'm not a fan of facial hair on trouser roles but Losier makes it work. She could make anything work. [quote from the person who posted the following clip] Because I mean who doesn’t like Berlioz?  And then there are our trousered actors who are icons to lesbians (but not necessarily lesbian icons): Katherine Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich (who wore suits better than most men do) spring immediately to mind; and then there’s Cate Blanchett starring in the title role of Carol. The movie is based on The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith which is said to be her most autobiographical novel.  Brilliantly parodied by Kate McKinnon:  Carol is the last film I saw in a theater.  I knew it was an art film; ‘swhy I didn’t ask any friends to go with me. It’s an art film all right. S…..L…..O…..W. I don’t want chase scenes or superheroes but please the novel moves faster and it is s-l-o-w too! Maybe that’s why ever after Highsmith wrote about Mr. Ripley. Who is talented. Of course no discussion of lesbian heartthrobs would be complete without k.d. lang:  Or Melissa Etheridge:
