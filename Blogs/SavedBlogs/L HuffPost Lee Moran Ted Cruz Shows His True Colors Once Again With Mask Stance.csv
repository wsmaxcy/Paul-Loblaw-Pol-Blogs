L, Ted Cruz Shows His True Colors Once Again With Mask Stance, Lee Moran, 2021-04-16, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) faced backlash on Thursday after declaring he’d no longer wear a face mask in the U.S. Capitol or on the Senate floor. Cruz told CNN he was ditching the mask because he and “everybody working in the Senate” have received COVID-19 vaccinations. But that isn’t the case. Not all senators aides or journalists working in the Senate have gotten the jabs. Cruz also referred to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance which he claimed says “small groups particularly with people who were vaccinated don’t need to wear masks” per CNN. However the CDC website urges continued caution. It does say people who have been fully vaccinated can “visit inside a home or private setting without a mask with other fully vaccinated people of any age” and “visit inside a home or private setting without a mask with one household of unvaccinated people who are not at risk for severe illness.” But it recommends avoiding medium or large-sized gatherings adhering to workplace guidance and against visiting indoors “without a mask with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.” “We’re still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19” the CDC guidance states encouraging people to “keep taking precautions” after being vaccinated “like wearing a mask staying 6 feet apart from others and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces ― in public places until we know more.” Lawmakers in the Senate unlike the House are not mandated to wear masks. Critics on Twitter slammed Cruz who in February jetted off to Cancun for a family vacation while his home state of Texas suffered widespread power outages and water shortages caused by winter storms: The modern conservative movement.  "I'm fine I don't care about other people." https://t.co/hJY5G4BgAw As a nurse still seeing active #COVID19 cases (& deaths) this makes me ill. Wear a mask @tedcruz https://t.co/QLt5iMT6Yn @tedcruz is a selfish self-centered jerk. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. @SenTedCruz Your rights end where mine begin. You have no right to put others' health at risk. You're a flaming as*hole. https://t.co/dmXL4c7ANq After 13 months of a major pandemic our Senators STILL don't understand the basic concept of "setting a precedent for other people."It's really not that complicated. @tedcruz - Even if you’re #vaccinated you can still pass #COVID-19 that’s lands in your nose and stays alive for 72 hours. You’re just a #pathetic #selfish little #snowflake #POS #TeddyBoyCancunCruz. You will get #Lysoled if you come near me without a mask! A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus
