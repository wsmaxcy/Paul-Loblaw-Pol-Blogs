L, Fox News Warns of a Progressive 'War on Mother's Day'., TheCriticalMind, 2021-05-09, Whenever there’s a holiday there’s a conservative warning that progressives have launched a war on it. And sure enough Evie Fordham penned a piece on Fox News sounding the alert that some on the left want to retire ‘mother’ in favor of ‘birthing people’.  To be honest the article seems pro forma and the author’s heart doesn’t appear to be in it. This is not surprising when the headline reads “Pelosi Biden praise moms on Mother's Day amid progressive talk of 'birthing people'.” It is hard to maintain that progressives are up to something when the two most powerful Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi aren’t in on the action. In fact they made no mention of ‘birthing people’. The White House tweeted a very robust “Happy Mother’s Day”. And the Speaker of the House was equally clear in her salutation.  So where did Fox happen on this renaming of ‘mother’? One Democratic Congressperson Cori Bush representing St Louis prefers the name ‘birthing people’. And why not? She should be free to use whatever vocabulary she thinks best conveys her message. However while conservatives claim to be big fans of freedom they are so often upset when people choose to exercise their liberties. What’s worse is that in their rush to slime the left with vocabulary criticism they ignore Bush’s point. And that is Blacks giving birth suffer worse outcomes than other groups because of medical racism.  I have no reason to doubt that Bush is correct on the statistics. It jibes with every analysis that shows the outcomes for Blacks are worse in almost every social reckoning. The second — and only other —  piece of ‘evidence’ for Fox’s claim of a progressive reimagining of Mother’s Day is NARAL’s support for Bush as they retweeted her with the comment  “When we talk about birthing people we're being inclusive. It's that simple.We use gender neutral language when talking about pregnancy because it's not just cis-gender women that can get pregnant and give birth.  Reproductive freedom is for *every* body.”  The right-wing will once again be ‘just shocked’ at this stick in the eye of tradition. And in doing so will continue their very real war on ‘motherhood’ (or ‘birthing people’). They will maintain their opposition to family leave to daycare to expanded pre-K to equal wages for women and the right to their old job for mothers re-entering the workforce. And unfortunately too many conservative mothers will be distracted from the real insults to their status by cheap rhetoric and cynicism. And when it comes to cheap rhetoric and cynicism you would be hard-pressed to find a more enthusiastic proponent than Ted ‘Cancun’ Cruz. But what do you expect from a man who values motherhood so little he kisses the ass of the man who called the mother of his children ugly. How will Ted explain that to his daughters when they are old enough to understand the full import of his dismissal of their mother? “Don’t worry I never let Trump call your mom a ‘birthing person”?
