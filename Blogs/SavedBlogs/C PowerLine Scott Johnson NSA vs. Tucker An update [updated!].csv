C, NSA vs. Tucker: An update [updated!], Scott Johnson, 2021-06-30, Just before his show was aired last night the NSA issued a statement responding to Tucker Carlson’s charge that the agency is monitoring his electronic communications. As anyone familiar with the ways of Washington knows however the NSA statement requires close reading. Techno Fog gives it a close reading and concludes:  Those who look closely will see something else: that the NSA while stating that Tucker “has never been an intelligence target” does not categorically deny having his electronic communications. Something is up. The NSA statement is below. Despite its tenor Mr. Fog finds the statement to be ambiguous.

Her comments represent a classic Washington non-denial. She seems to be toying with us. As I say psickening.

Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
