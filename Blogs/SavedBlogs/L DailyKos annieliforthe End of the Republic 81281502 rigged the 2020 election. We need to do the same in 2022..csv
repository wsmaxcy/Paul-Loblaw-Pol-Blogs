L, 81281502 "rigged" the 2020 election. We need to do the same in 2022., annieliforthe End of the Republic, 2021-07-05,  I think this is key. As a measure of overall public sentiment this mid-term election is extraordinary; not just in respect of vote share (Dems +7% plus) but in terms of overall vote totals. https://t.co/LrdmjT1xaD    Republicans’ effort to deny the Capitol attack is working – and it’s dangerous https://t.co/4Dx8N05AsA Six months on from the mayhem on 6 January when a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the heart of American democracy to disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden’s election victory Republicans and rightwing media have variously attempted to downplay the attack or blame it on leftwing infiltrators and the FBI. Interviews with diehard Trump fans suggest that the riot denialism is working. Many refuse to condemn the insurrectionists who beat police officers smashed windows and called for then Vice-President Mike Pence to be hanged. The swirl of conspiracy theories combined with Trump’s deluded claims of a stole election raise fears of a replay that could be even more violent. “Rightwing media and some Republicans including Republicans in the Senate and the House are trying to make it seem as though what was a siege on the Capitol was not actually a siege on the Capitol” said Monika McDermott a political science professor at Fordham University in New York. www.theguardian.com/... The next insurrection: They don't have the votes but they've got the guns https://t.co/NB3eGELnR6   "What’s not made clear to Gettr’s new users though is that the site received initial funding from a foundation owned by Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui and his family."https://t.co/IwwUPUlGCH And in an apparent bid to lure users from other platforms and grow its user base Gettr allows Twitter users to import their content onto the platform. But Miller’s new site is already facing growing pains. Some new users reported that the site had encouraged them to follow a user named “Hitler” that used the German dictator’s face as its profile picture. Gettr has also grappled with the appearance of at least one Miller imposter. Shortly after Gettr’s launch an account called “Jason Miller” amassed hundreds of followers and claimed that Trump would soon join the social network. The account was later suspended. Guo has also courted President Trump’s then-personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. In the runup to the 2020 election pro-Guo pundits teased the existence of a Biden laptop “bombshell” weeks before news that Giuliani had obtained Hunter Biden’s device. After social media networks suspended or limited the reach of materials taken from Hunter Biden’s laptop Guo’s social media platforms became one of the few places hosting materials from the laptop including revenge porn of Hunter Biden while Guo posed for pictures with Giuliani smoking cigars. www.thedailybeast.com/...  Jason Miller who once was a spokesperson to the former President had his page taken over Insider reported. The accounts of Steve Bannon Mike Bannon Harlan Hill and Sean Parnell were also hacked. All of the profiles were changed to the one message which read: "@JubaBaghdad was here :) ^^ free Palestine ^^." According to reports the accounts were first hacked around 8:30am EST and the majority of the profiles returned to normal by 10am. Insider spoke with user @JubaBaghdad who allegedly claimed responsibility for the hack via a Twitter DM with the outlet. When asked why they decided to target GETTR they said it was ""just for fun". www.businessinsider.com/... The hacker added: "hackers will scrap user data and will sell it on [the] black market like in dark web" while adding that there remain a high number of bugs in the code of "Gettr."  10’s of millions of people worship a transparently deranged lifelong con artist & fraud who lies to them like a human Gatling Gun & spews out completely insane made up nonsense and all they want at all times is more of it. It’ll never cease to astound me every minute of the day.
