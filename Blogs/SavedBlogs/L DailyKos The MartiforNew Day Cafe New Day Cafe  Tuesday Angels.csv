L, New Day Cafe:  Tuesday Angels, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-06-29, Good Morning Cafe!  Hope the day is treating you well!  Pull up a chair and have a cuppa and a nosh….      All are welcome to join the fun the silliness the conversations. If you don’t know...just ask! Some things really do require a bit of explanation. There will be a few surprises along the way all good ones we hope. We are here to keep building the Daily Kos Community. We post Mon-Sun at 10:30 a.m. Eastern. Pie fights will be met with outrageous ridicule and insults. Trolls will be incinerated and served at the next group BBQ.  As briquettes. Over last weekend I happened to come across a favourite movie….Michael which starred John Travolta as the Archangel Michael.  Very odd casting but it worked!!  I’m not a huge fan of his but loved him in this and in Phenomenon.  It’s also a weird but wonderful road trip movie.    . . Synopsis from IMDB:  Frank Quinlan [William Hurt] and Huey Driscoll [Robert Pastorelli] two reporters from a Chicago-based tabloid along with Dorothy Winters [Andie MacDowell] an 'angel expert' are asked to travel to rural Iowa to investigate a claim from an old woman [Jean Stapleton] that she shares her house with a real live archangel named Michael. Upon arrival they see that her claims are true - but Michael is not what they expected: he smokes drinks beer has a very active libido and has a rather colourful vocabulary. In fact they would never believe it were it not for the two feathery wings protruding from his back. Michael agrees to travel to Chicago with the threesome but what they don't realise is that the journey they are about to undertake will change their lives forever.
