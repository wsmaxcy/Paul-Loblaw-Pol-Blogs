L, New Day Cafe: Tuesday Feel Good, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-04-27, Good mornin Cafe!  Hope all are doing well….I’m  posting this at around 1 in the morning so you can imagine how chuffed I am!  Actually I would’ve been working on it sooner but around 5 this evening….I GOT SLEEPY!!!  Haven’t had that feeling in ages so I took full advantage of it and got a two hour nap.  After that...caught up on the news and wondered where I’d get inspiration for today’s diary. Have a cuppa and a nosh and see what’s what…… I had nuthin’ for today but Twitter came to my rescue….If this doesn’t make your day make immediate plans to see your doctor! Ending today with this. Good night. 💚pic.twitter.com/JNHyPuRxgH If you need another reason….I also have this…. “She won't stop wagging her tail ❤️️” https://t.co/RYKmPpi9Kf
