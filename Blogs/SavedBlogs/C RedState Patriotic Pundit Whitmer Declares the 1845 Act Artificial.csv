C, Whitmer Declares the 1845 Act "Artificial", Patriotic Pundit, 2020-10-12, This past week Whitmer has been all over MSM declaring “Michigan will be able to announce results but we are not going to have artificial deadlines set by you know people with political agendas.” This could lead to a very scary proposition for the constituents of the this important battleground state. There will be no set deadline no official accountability for the elected officials to complete their ballot tallies. In one of the most important and contested elections to date. If it cannot be on election night why not select a suitable alternative date to report the ballot counts such as the 5th 8th or 15th? Due to the lack of any deadline obtaining the Michigan election results could possiblytake us through to the end of the year. One might worry about the culpability for ballot harvesting past postmarked ballots or other fraudulent practices that could occur with no set deadline. It is odd that she appears to be reveling in her defiance of the actual government and constitution in which she took an oath to uphold. Actually the election date itself is not artificial at all. It was set on January 23 1845. On that day the 28th US Congress passed “An act to establish a uniform time for holding elections for electors of President and Vice President in all the States of the Union. The act selected “the Tuesday after the first Monday in November” as the day on which all states must appoint electors. This standardization greatly increased the speed of Presidential elections; the previous election of 1844 lasted from November 1-December 4. From 1845 onward every Presidential election has been held on this date.” For 172 years the precedent has been set for the election for every state in the US. This date is hardly artificial although it is political as it is a component of the political process which in a free society one with a constitution should be governed by and the constituents of each district should be able to rely as being the law of the land even in the State of Michigan.
