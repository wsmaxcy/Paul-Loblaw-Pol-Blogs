L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: C.B. Embry- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-20, On this date in 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” published profiles of Kentucky State Senator C.B. Embry who we recognized in our first profile as the sponsor of legislation that would offer a $2500 bounty on transgendered public school students using the “incorrect bathroom”. This was in January 2015 (right after he won a new term in the state senate) and not long thereafter he killed a bill about trying to decide how school superintendents are picked by trying to sneak an amendment on it for a ban on transgender citizens using public bathrooms (sadly Embry’s brand of transphobic madness has now become the status quo of Republican domestic policy).Embry has also palled around with Kentucky clerk Kim Davis supporting her homophobic quest against same sex marriage so much that he sponsored SB 5 a “religious freedom” law to allow for discrimination against LGBTQ citizens. Rounding out Embry’s profile he repeatedly has supported legislation to require mandatory (but medically unnecessary) ultrasounds on all abortions without exception even for victims of rape and incest supported a TRAP law to attempt to shut down all abortion clinics in his state wants concealed carry of firearms without a permit for all citizens voted for a bill which would define first responders as a protected class in hate crimes legislation (which he really don’t think it’s bad but the fact that he thinks it shouldn’t apply to LGBTQ citizens who are BORN gay but it should apply to people based on their employment choices is troubling) and under his “legislative priorities” on Project Vote Smart lists “the coal industry” as his top concern which is as honest of him as it is downright sad for his constituents.In 2018 Embry supported legislation to ban abortion at 11 weeks because if a 20-week ban will get overturned by the courts as unconstitutional via Roe v. Wade surely an eleven week ban would get the support of a judge right? (NO.) He only could get more fanatical sand extreme in what anti-choice legislation he supported including sponsoring of a fetal heartbeat bill to effectively outlaw the procedure at 6 weeks (before most women even know they’re pregnant) and a “Born-Alive Infant Protection Act” which is of course not based in reality of how abortions even work whatsoever.We’re expecting Embry to run for re-election in 2022 when he’ll be 81 and not be surprised if he keeps trying to overturn Roe v. Wade outright until his dying breath.
