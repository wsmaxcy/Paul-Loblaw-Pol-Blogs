L, PWB: Da Study Ub Sleep, CathyMforPWB Peeps, 2021-06-29, But first here is a gentle reminder of how we do things: Pooties are cats; Woozles are dogs.  Goggies are dogs too. Birds...are birds!  Peeps are people.  PWB Peeps are Pooties Woozle Birds People.  Neat huh. Do not “Troll” the Pootie Peeps Diaries. Whatever happens in the outer blog STAYS in the outer blog. This is a place to relax and play; please treat it accordingly. If you hate animal diaries leave now.  No harm no foul; these aren’t to everyone’s taste. You are welcome to share photos of your own animals or ones you just like. If you would like a pic from the comment threads please ask the poster.  He/she may have a copyright to those pics.  Many thanks! If you have health/behavior issues with your pootie or woozle feel free to bring it to the community.  We just may have someone whose experience can help. There are some pics we never post:  snakes creepy crawlies any and all photos that depict or encourage human cruelty toward animals.  These are considered “out of bounds” and will not be tolerated. If you’re not sure about an issue...please ask.  Someone is always glad to help.        NOTE: Another 2019 rerun but hopefully the refresher course is okay. 😄
