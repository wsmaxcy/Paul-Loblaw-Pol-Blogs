L, Put insurrection on your dating profile and get a date... with the FBI., ian douglas rushlau, 2021-04-26, It would be easy to dismiss the fascists who attacked the Capitol with murderous intent on January 6th as delusional morons because well so many of them are delusional morons. Like this guy profiled by Esther Wang writing for Jezebel:  ...on Thursday it was revealed that at least one insurrectionist a New Yorker named Robert Chapman was nabbed based on a tip from someone he had matched with on the dating app Bumble and with whom he had boasted of entering the Capitol... According to court filings mere days after he stormed the Capitol Chapman was sharing details of his time as an insurrectionist with at least one person on Bumble. Unfortunately for Chapman that person was unimpressed with his decision to participate in mob violence screenshot their conversation and promptly reported him to the authorities… The FBI agent upon receiving this tip then used video footage to corroborate that Chapman was in fact inside Statuary Hall that day and also tracked down Chapman’s Facebook account where in one post he had written “I’M FUCKIN INSIDE THE CRAPITOL!!!” But to focus on the cognitive limitations of this representative sample of the GOP’s rank and file voters would miss the crucial characteristic that would prompt a person to publicly document their criminal activities— the sense of impunity they bring to their actions. And why wouldn’t they hold this perception? The ideological community they reside in is adamant that they in fact are entitled to do anything they damn well want to: Why the Rioters Thought They Could Get Away With It Trump told supporters that loyalty to his cause is more important than fidelity to the law and they took his message to heart. David Graham/ The Atlantic There has been a great deal of commentary about the white impunity on display during the attempted coup. Not only is it difficult to imagine law enforcement taking such a relaxed posture about the demonstration ahead of time with a largely nonwhite crowd; it is also hard to imagine officers reacting so placidly to the actual assault. One need only look at how authorities handled Black Lives Matter protesters in Lafayette Square over the summer to see the difference. Beyond that Donald Trump’s movement has been built on a foundation of racial grievance bigotry and white identity politics. ...the brazenness of the members of the mob remains distinctive. White protesters who joined BLM demonstrations over the summer may have been outraged by police crackdowns but they were hardly surprised. Yet even in the act of storming the Capitol the insurrectionists did not fear any adverse consequences. The now-infamous Elizabeth From Knoxville both was clear about what was happening—“We’re storming the Capitol! It’s a revolution!”—and also seemed genuinely affronted that the police sworn to protect the Capitol and government had the temerity to mace her… ...the rioters were also imbued with the culture of impunity of the Trump era. This is a moment when bad behavior goes unpunished. The president has told his supporters that loyalty to his cause trumps fidelity to the law and he has reinforced that message by handing out pardons to aides who get in trouble for putting him ahead of the law. The crowd he summoned to Capitol Hill on January 6 took that message to heart. Trump did not invent this culture of impunity. Even before he broke onto the political scene officeholders from David Vitter to Bob Menendez to Chris Christie were realizing that when caught in a scandal they didn’t have to resign and could just brazen it out. But Trump elevated this move from a tactic to a virtue. His 2016 campaign exalted getting away with it whatever it was: fleecing lenders buying off politicians grabbing women by the crotch. He encouraged violence against protesters at rallies and even spoke of paying legal fees when someone punched a demonstrator. (Given his miserliness it’s doubtful he followed through. Keeping promises like following the rules is for suckers.) This sense of impunity is rooted in the worldview of every rank and file GOP voter and the candidates they elect in the hopes of elevating a fascist regime— the nation belongs to them and exists for their benefit alone. GOP measures to immunize people who run over protesters=GOP knows it needs fraud and violence to win elections. “They are hurrying to enact all these laws because they know social justice movements are spreading in the country.” My comments for @TPM https://t.co/fDToWg77Ql This isn’t a revelation. We’ve known it for a long time: Republicans Want a White Republic. They'll Destroy America to Get It Carol Anderson Charles Howard Candler Professor of African American Studies at Emory University/ TIME JULY 17 2019 The GOP’s membership is nearly 90 percent white and can only envision carnage and extinction as it looks upon a rights-based religious racial and ideologically diverse America. Or as Lindsey Graham had noted as early as 2012 “We’re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.” In short the United States of America is not really their America. They yearn for a white republic. That’s why they are fighting to recreate the days when as Archie Bunker sang “Guys like us we had it made.” That’s why they’ve willingly gone along with and participated in a sustained attack on the country itself allowing it to grow weaker so that they could feel stronger.  Conservatives: Shit-hole countries are trying to replace our Anglo Saxon heritage.Everyone: holy shitConservatives: And and why isn’t there a WHITE pride parade?Everyone: wtfConservatives: also I’m afraid to say what’s really on my mindEveryone: pic.twitter.com/zWldPGNSMi This worldview with the attendant sense of entitlement and impunity it begets has only grown in virulence since January 6th. Still dealing with the GOP as if it’s well-intentioned misled or lost in a trance or like anything that’s happening is normal or par for the course only allows their antidemocratic pursuits to gain traction and momentum. See this thing for what it is. Either we see it for what it is or we lose our democracy to a fascist crowd that has no interest in working towards a just pluralistic society. "Voting rights" is not the only issue: election subversion is an even more dangerous threat : https://t.co/o47zSW4t0j
