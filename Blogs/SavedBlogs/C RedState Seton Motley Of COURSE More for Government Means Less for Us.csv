C, Of COURSE More for Government Means Less for Us, Seton Motley, 2021-03-22, Every business that wants to be around next year began this year with a budget.  A roadmap on how they will spend their resources – on employees materials etc. For almost all businesses government is the largest line item.  Paying taxes – and paying to comply with regulations – consumes the largest chunk of their operating expenses. This of course explains why Big Business and Big Government so often collude to grow an ever-bigger government.  Big Business can afford the additional costs.  Their smaller competitors?  Not so much. This also partly explains Big Government’s China Virus lockdowns.  Big Businesses – including especially Big Tech – have during the shutdowns added hundreds of billions of dollars to their bank accounts.  Their smaller competitors?  Not so much.  Nine million (and counting) have either closed for good – or are well on their way to oblivion. So yes of course businesses of all sizes budget for government.  Because they have to – because they want to still be around next year. So when government parachutes in with even more government – things can quite quickly get ugly. It certainly happened last year with the out-of-nowhere lockdowns.  And it’s happening again right now in California (as if California’s nation’s-most-ridiculous lockdowns weren’t bad enough). And what’s worse California is so huge – it’s stupid policies often become de facto national policies.  As is happening again right now. As is always the case when California’s government demands more – we get less.  Because as is always the case more time effort and money spent on government – means less time effort and money spent on us. California Can Enforce Its Tough Net Neutrality Law Federal Judge Says: “California can finally enforce its state law SB 822 which has been described by industry watchers as the strongest of its kind in the country and has been seen as a model for other states…. “The move is a major victory for internet activists and state legislators who had passed tough new regulations in 2018 after the Federal Communications Commission rolled back its own net neutrality rules.” Who are the “Internet activists” for whom this is a “major victory?”  Media Marxist joints like…. Public Knowledge Celebrates Net Neutrality Victory in California: “‘We look forward to working with the new FCC to ensure that consumers nationwide have the same protections that California residents now enjoy.’” Free Press: California Net Neutrality Law Clears Major Hurdle: “The California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act passed in 2018 to fill the void left by the Trump FCC’s repeal of federal open-internet rules and policies.” Why do we call these joints Media Marxist? Leftist ‘Media Reform’ Outfit Free Press and Their Marxist Co-Founder Robert McChesney McChesney is a barrel of Commie laughs: “There is no real answer (to the U.S. economic crisis) but to remove brick by brick the capitalist system itself rebuilding the entire society on socialist principles…. “Any serious effort to reform the media system would have to necessarily be part of a revolutionary program to overthrow the capitalist system itself…. “At the moment the battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies. We are not at that point yet. But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control.” Funny funny stuff. McChesney’s “Consumer Interest” joint – and their fellow “Consumer Interest” joints – are THRILLED with California’s newly-imposed law. All of which leads to the blatantly obvious…. Leftist ‘Consumer Interest’ Groups Are Only Interested in Big Government Why Are the Media’s ‘Consumer Interest Groups’ So Leftist and Anti-Consumer? Alleged ‘Consumer Groups’ Oppose Consumers Getting Stuff from Anyone but Government Because as anyone with an IQ above nine on a warm day knows – Socialism doesn’t work out so well for the Consumers about whom these Media Marxists pretend to care. Because more for government – means less for us. AT&T Halting Some Free Data Services in Response to California Law: “AT&T Inc said Wednesday it will halt some free data services in response to a California net neutrality law the latest flashpoint in an ongoing debate over internet rules…. “The U.S. wireless carrier said the state law bans “sponsored data” services that allowed companies such as video providers to pay for some data usage of certain AT&T wireless customers. “’Given that the Internet does not recognize state borders the new law not only ends our ability to offer California customers such free data services but also similarly impacts our customers in states beyond California’ AT&T said in a statement.” So the Media Marxist joints bizarrely claim the “Consumer Interest” mantle.  But they get exactly the massive government expansion they want in California – and We the Consumers nationwide get screwed. Because as anyone with an IQ above nine on a warm day knows: More for government – means less for us.
