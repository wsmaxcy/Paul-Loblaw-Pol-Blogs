C, Racial Criminal Bias in Philadelphia: If You're Black You're Many More Times Likely to be Murdered, Dana Pico, 2020-10-14, The Washington Post’s columnist Jennifer Rubin who has been suffering mightily from #TrumpDerangementSyndrome recently tweeted of Judge Amy Coney Barrett President Trump’s nominee to fill the vacant seat on the United States Supreme Court “(Senator Cory) Booker revealing how clueless and incurious she is about criminal racial bias”. Perhaps it isn’t Judge Barrett but Mrs Rubin who is if not clueless then willfully blind about racial criminal bias. The esteemed Robert Stacy McCain was kind enough to cite my website The First Street Journal in his article “Philadelphia: Murder City USA.” We weren’t the only ones he cited and you can read the rest there. According to the Philadelphia Police Department there had been 480 homicides as of 11:59 PM on October 13th. With an average of 1.324 people killed every single day in Philly and 79 days remaining in the year that gives us an estimated 104 more bodies in the streets by the end of the year for a total of 484. If that number holds up it will be the third bloodiest year in Philly’s history behind only 1990’s 505 and 1989’s 489. Mr McCain began his article saying “If you want to stay alive stay out of Philadelphia.” I know I know: math is raaaaacist but I’m still one of those let’s do the math guys. With 484 projected homicides for the year and a population of 1584000 that works out to a murder rate of 30.56 per 100000. However while the City of Brotherly Love is only 41.5% black at least in 2019 blacks accounted for 85% of homicide victims 73% of them male and the remaining 12% female. Assuming that holds true for 2020 411 of the projected 484 murders will be of black men and women 353 males and 58 females. Assuming that males make up 49% of the black population and females 51% we have black male and female populations of 322106 and 335254 respectively. The murder rate then becomes 17.31 for black females and 109.63 for black males. For everybody who isn’t black the murder rate in foul fetid fuming foggy filthy Philadelphia is 7.88 per 100000. For 2018 the overall murder rate for the United States was 5.0 per 100000 so yeah it’s higher for non-blacks in Philly but not extraordinarily so. Go see the Liberty Bell Go visit Independence Hall. South Philadelphia isn’t too bad Chestnut Hill and Mt Airy are OK. As long as you’re careful parking on Girard Avenue Philadelphia has a great zoo. But if you’re black . . . . There are two kinds of crimes: crimes of evidence and crimes of reporting. If a man rapes a woman on the streets of Philadelphia as far as the police are concerned if it wasn’t reported it didn’t happen. It is commonly assumed that most rapes go unreported with some guesstimates being as high as 90% not reported. Crimes like robbery might go unreported if the victims do not trust the police or think it will do any good or are fearful of revenge by the criminals. When your city is stuck with a District Attorney like Larry Krasner who doesn’t believe in prosecuting criminals what reason is there to report that you were robbed? But murder is different: it is a crime of evidence. It isn’t easy to dispose of a dead body in a way that it won’t be found especially if you haven’t carefully planned things. You’re looking at 100 to 300 pounds of dead meat bone and fat and something which will put off a strong and nasty odor after very little time. The vast majority of dead bodies get found. So when I read that most crime had decreased in Philadelphia I just flat don’t believe it. Murder isn’t normally an entry-level crime; guys who shoot other people have usually been bad guys before that. Let’s face facts: all crime is rising in Philly and the attitudes of Mayor Jim Kenney a Democrat and District Attorney Krasner a Democrat funded by George Soros just make it worse. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw admitted that her department’s clearance rate for homicides is decreasing down to 47%. One out of every two killings is going unsolved. This is what you get when you elect Democrats Democrats who are afraid to address crime because that might be racist!
