L, Just moments before the traitor left office Florida company gets sweet gig on the Pentagon internet, Pakalolo, 2021-04-26, This is just a quick post as my movers are coming at any moment and pack my pc away. kittylou wrote on this story but only received 5 recs. Inquiring minds want to know what the fuck this is about.   From Business Insider:  A mysterious Florida company is said to have taken control of a substantial portion of the internet owned by the Pentagon only three minutes before President Donald Trump's official term in office ended. Since then the company has increased its control to as much as 6% of the total internet or about 175 million addresses The Washington Post reported on Saturday. The Associated Press reported that it controlled more space than some of the world's largest internet providers including Comcast and AT&T. The company was identified as Global Resource Systems LLC headquartered in Plantation Florida. According to Florida state records Global Resource Systems filed paperwork in October 2020. The paperwork said it was incorporated in Delaware. A Department of Defense spokesperson told the AP in a statement that the government was publicizing the space to "assess evaluate and prevent unauthorized use of DoD IP address space." On Twitter on Saturday the AP posted: "What a Pentagon spokesman could not explain is why the Defense Department chose Global Resource Systems LLC a company that seems not to have existed until September to manage the address space." A Saturday blog post from Doug Madory director of internet analysis at Kentik a networking information provider detailed the "great mystery." On inauguration day at 16:57 UTC or 11:57am in Washington a message was posted by an "entity that hadn't been heard from in over a decade" Madory wrote. The post came from AS8003 announcing it had taken over unused ranges of the IPv4 internet space owned by the Department of Defense according to Madory. He wrote that the timing was "moments after the swearing-in of Joe Biden as the President of the United States and minutes before the statutory end of the administration of Donald Trump at noon Eastern time."   Naturally the Kremlin poodle and his cronies have not answered press questions from the press. Questions that need answers. Lock him up! Daily Mail has some curious updates and more detail than the Bloomberg article. The transfer was for 175 million addresses.  'As to why the DoD would have done that I´m a little mystified same as you' said Paul Vixie an internet pioneer credited with designing its naming system and the CEO of Farsight Security. The company did not return phone calls or emails from reporters. It has no web presence though it has the domain grscorp.com. Its name doesn't appear on the directory of its Plantation Florida domicile and a receptionist drew a blank when an AP reporter asked for a company representative at the office earlier this month. She found its name on a tenant list and suggested trying email. Records show the company has not obtained a business license in Plantation. Incorporated in Delaware and registered by a Beverly Hills lawyer Global Resource Systems LLC now manages more internet space than China Telecom AT&T or Comcast. The only name associated with it on the Florida business registry coincides with that of a man listed as recently as 2018 in Nevada corporate records as a managing member of a cybersecurity/internet surveillance equipment company called Packet Forensics. The company had nearly $40 million in publicly disclosed federal contracts over the past decade with the FBI and the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency among its customers. That man Raymond Saulino is also listed as a principal in a company called Tidewater Laskin Associates which was incorporated in 2018 and obtained an FCC license in April 2020. It shares the same Virginia Beach Virginia address - a UPS store - in corporate records as Packet Forensics. The two have different mailbox numbers. Calls to the number listed on the Tidewater Laskin FCC filing are answered by an automated service that offers four different options but doesn´t connect callers with a single one recycling all calls to the initial voice recording.
