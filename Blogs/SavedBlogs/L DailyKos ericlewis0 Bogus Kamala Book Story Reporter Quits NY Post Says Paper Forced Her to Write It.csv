L, Bogus Kamala Book Story Reporter Quits NY Post Says Paper Forced Her to Write It, ericlewis0, 2021-04-27, From The Wrap: A New York Post reporter who wrote a since-retracted article about migrant children getting a copy of Vice President Kamala Harris’ book as part of “welcome kits” said she resigned on Tuesday after she was “ordered to write” the story. “Today I handed in my resignation to my editors at the New York Post” reporter Laura Italiano tweeted. “The Kamala Harris story — an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard enough against — was my breaking point.” A spokesperson for the Post which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. www.thewrap.com/… Golf clap for Laura Italiano trying to save her career in journalism. Pro-tip Ms. Italiano — don’t work for a Murdoch rag. Nevertheless one can hope her action will make it plain to the world that no Murdoch-owned news outlet can be trusted.
