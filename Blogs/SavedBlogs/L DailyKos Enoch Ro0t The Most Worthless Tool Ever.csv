L, The Most Worthless Tool Ever, Enoch Ro0t, 2021-07-04, It’s garage/yard sale weekend in my area and I hit four or five of them on Friday.  There were no treasures but I did pick up a few items — most notably a Millers Falls dual-speed eggbeater breast drill in real nice shape: But that’s not the star of this diary.  I freely admit to owning way too many hand planes but this one was so astoundingly bad I just had to have it.  It was still in its plastic display package but it had been used at least once.  I should probably say at most once.  Nobody would use it twice.  This thing is an atrocity.  Read on for the raw details.. He wanted five bucks.  I told the guy he should be paying me to take it off his hands.  He didn’t argue the point but he still wanted five bucks for it.  I set it back down and wandered around the yard.  I came back with a few rusty files and a wood rasp offered $5 for the bundle and we had a deal. Where to start?  There is so much fail here.  There are no manufacturer’s identification marks anywhere on this plane.  That’s understandable.  No corporate entity with any degree of pride would ever put their name on something this spectacularly bad.  Let’s begin with the wood parts since those are the first thing one touches.  Both the front and rear handles are finished with a varnish-like substance that looks and feels like it’s been rolled around in sand while still wet.  Was this intentional?  A feature for a non-slip grip perhaps?  No I think not.. Both handles appear at first glance to be sized and shaped for our hands but once you pick the thing up it’s evident that this tool was designed with a species other than homo sapiens in mind.  Yes it’s that bad. The screws are straight from the hardware store — Your generic zinc plated flat top slotted wood screw.  They do the job and manage to look like a cheap afterthought at the same time.  Congratulations guys!  OK let’s move on.  Time to take it apart for a look at the guts.  First problem: Removing the lever cap.  The head of the hold-down screw wouldn’t clear the kidney bean shaped hole without a lot of wiggling and twisting around.  But I succeeded after a half minute or so of fussing and cussing. Holy crap just look at that pic below.  This casting got a rough pass or two of machining on the surface and then they gave it the thinnest coating of nickel plate possible.  They didn’t bother with nonsense like de-burring the sharp edges or cleaning up the as-cast holes.   As for the casting itself I have sponges that are less porous.  Those pits in the image below aren’t from rust — They’re voids that permeate the entire casting.  I would strongly advise these guys to hire a metallurgist.  And a mechanical engineer.  And a CAD designer.  And a manufacturing engineer... All right I now have it disassembled.  As each component is removed I uncover new levels of epic engineering and manufacturing failure.  The picture below doesn’t begin to illustrate how bad this tool is.  The tissue box is for the tears I shed over the sheer incompetence and indifference that went into creating this miserable thing.  Onward.  That thing in my hand is called the chip breaker.  It screws to the cutting iron and its function is to curl the wood shavings and eject them up and away from the work piece.  Chip breakers are not generally made with hardened steel but they do require a certain amount of structural integrity to work properly.  This one has no structural integrity to speak of.  The steel is so thin and soft that I could bend it in half using only one hand.  Again there is no de-burring of the sharp edges. The whole manufacturing process amounted to stamping it out cutting a screw thread and machining the surface that meets with the iron up near the cutting edge.  You can see where the metal got too hot and turned blue by my thumb in the pic to the right.  I could have done a better job with my bench grinder after a six pack and a joint.  Then there’s the body casting — The foundation of the tool.  It’s just as bad as everything we’ve seen so far.  Maybe worse.  First look how thin the sole bed is compared to my Bailey in the image below.  I measured it and it’s about a third of the Bailey’s.  Damn.. Another facepalm moment.  Look at that adjusting screw.  There are things called tolerances and manufacturing variation.  See my earlier comments on the topic of hiring some engineers.. More Gallery of Fail: The Y-shaped yoke in the foreground below is a couple of shoddily fabricated stampings staked together.  The squarish end that engages the chip breaker for iron depth adjustment (at right) was ground apparently without coolant — It’s turned blue from excessive heat.  And of course there is no de-burring.  You can cut yourself handling this thing.  I did.  I’ve taken some inexpensive modern planes and tuned them up to perform acceptably well.  I didn’t even try with this one.  It would have been hopeless. Why put the money into producing something that doesn’t even work?  They could have spent a little more relatively on design development and manufacturing and brought a competitive product to the market.  I don’t get it. Yesterday I did the right thing for humanity and scrapped it: Now let’s take a closer look at that cool old egg-beater drill…  Happy 4th everyone!  ER
