L, ‘You know I was there right?:’ Another Capitol insurrectionist arrested in Central Florida, Hank Z, 2021-05-10, Will these idiot insurrectionists ever learn to keep their mouths shut? A Chuluota man who bragged on social media about being inside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot was arrested Monday adding to the growing list of Central Florida residents involved in the deadly ordeal according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida. John Maron Nassif 55 also was captured on surveillance footage inside the Capitol rotunda an arrest affidavit said. On Jan. 20 Nassif again posted to social media to say he was inside the Capitol the affidavit said. “I found myself inside the building. The Rotunda was nearly filled with people” he wrote. “No one was fighting or being violent. More pushing and I decided to leave. It wasn’t until I was walking back that I heard a rumor someone had been shot. It wasn’t till I got back to my hotel room I learned the specifics. Anyone telling you this was some type of coup etc. is telling you lies.” Nassif is facing charges of entering a restricted building or grounds and violent entry or disorderly conduct. If convicted he faces up to one year in prison a year probation and a $100000 fine. He had a hearing Monday afternoon at the federal courthouse in downtown Orlando. Nassif was the only person not wearing a mask in court. The judge OK’d Nassif’s request not to have his face covered because his lawyer — masked up — was sitting closest to him and was fine with it. … Nassif can’t renew his expired passport possess or use drugs alcohol or firearms or travel outside the Middle District of Florida. He was also concerned about being assigned a public defender out of D.C. for the virtual hearing next week. But U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas B. Smith said “Given the number of people being charged they’ve got this down by now.” After the hearing Nassif yelled “Go away” and held up a hand to block his face as a group of reporters tried to ask about the charges against him. It appears Mr. Nassif doesn’t want the world to know about his crimes. A bit too late for that especially since he bragged about it on Faebook. Full story at www.orlandosentinel.com/...
