L, Little Blue Dudes Becomes a Blue Water River Dragon., PadreMellyrn, 2021-06-29, If you ever watched Little Blue Dude get a bath you would know why he is now a water dragon.  He would twist and turn and slip and slide. Till we figured out he didn’t like the sound of the shower and then he loved his baths. He is in his “Forever-Forever home” a 5”x 8” ceder box.  And I thought since I wanted a “Water Dragon” on my arm lets make him one.  Now he will have even more ‘immortality”. I am already working on getting “Kirin” with the Face of my old Kiwi who walked the rainbow bridge some years back  and was little Blue Dudes sponsor kitty. When he first came home the Kiwi Fruits walked up the little guy and Booped the Fluff. It would only be right they be together. Well we are at the skin peeling stage so I can say this Tatto was sucessful. Next one is going to be on the Right arm and will be the old Kiwi Fruits maybe as a Kirin or Lion.
