C, Quick Rant: Dear Disney Stand Up To China, Chase Watkins, 2020-09-23, The 20th Century was almost certainly the bloodiest time period in human history. A pandemic two World Wars detonation of Atomic weapons and many mass killings under Communist regimes cement the unwanted title. Perhaps the event that stands out the most in the 100 years between 1900 and 2000 though is Nazi Germany’s concentration camps where millions of minorities were murdered simply because of their religious beliefs and immutable characteristics. That event leads people now-a-days to commit to “never forget” but do we really mean it? I’d venture an answer leaning towards no. The only difference between what the Nazis did to the Jews and other minorities in the 1940s and what the Communist Chinese Government is doing now to the Uighur Muslims is time: only an 80 year difference.  In the 1940s the West stood up to the Axis powers and defended the free world defeating the forces of evil and freeing its enslaved. But now an American corporation can’t even muster the courage to denounce the exact oppression that occurred under Hitler just because it would rather make a quick buck shooting a heartless live-action remake of a story everyone already knows. Disney a company that thrives off of making movies that correctly encourage young children to be the change they want to see in the world absolutely has a responsibility to practice what it preaches. Disney must stand up to the inhuman practices of the Chinese Government.
