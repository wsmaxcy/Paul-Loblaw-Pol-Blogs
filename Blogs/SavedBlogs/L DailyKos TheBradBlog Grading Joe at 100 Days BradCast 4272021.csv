L, Grading Joe at 100 Days: 'BradCast' 4/27/2021, TheBradBlog, 2021-04-26, On today's BradCast: We've got a lot of news to catch you up on from over the weekend -- and from today alone -- before we open the phones to listeners to ring in on Joe Biden's first 100 days in office. [Audio link to full show is posted below.] First up today's news...  For one it is being paid for by tax-payer dollars but run by a Trump supporter who in addition to having no knowledge of elections or election technology has a record of promoting demonstrably false claims about the election having been stolen by election system vendors a number of communist counties and allies of Joe Biden. The company heading up the count is also not using accepted hand-count practices established by the state. And they also refuses to disclose the amount or additional sources of dark money funding that it is receiving to carry out the hand tally. Moreover -- and most disturbing as of now -- is the fact that the tax-payer funded organizers are barring both media and the general public from overseeing the examination of the ballots from the 2020 election (which should theoretically be protected and remain in state custody under federal law for 22 months.) I am in close touch with some of the folks who are working as observers on the count -- the ones with actual experience in post-election audits and recounts unlike the Republicans in charge of this scheme -- and hope to have more information for you on this in the days ahead. Â There is no rush apparently. At the rate of counting being carried out by the paid-for counters -- who not only counting but examining ballots for signs of fraud -- it could take about 15 months to tally all of the ballots according to one experienced election integrity advocate closing tracking the process.
