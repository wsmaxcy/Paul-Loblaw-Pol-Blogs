L, ♀️ThisWeekInTheWarOnWomen: Teach Men2 Not Violate? Brain Science on Sociopolitics Shaping Behavior., mettle fatigueforThis Week in the War on Women, 2021-05-01,      Most of the news we’ve seen about teaching men and boys to not batter not rape not coerce or dominate etc. involves academic curriculum changes and additions or workshops from community organizations faith-based institutions etc.      If true easy fixes of curricula would achieve the necessary attitude adjustments toward minorities women poor people and so on.     The research reports in this diary show a perspective of neurologists psychologists sociologists etc that change-needing ideas & behaviors aren’t much instilled the way we hope changed behavior could be. Which may say something about the realism of that hope as the total arsenal for change. After all schools parents faiths etc have overtly taught good behavior for centuries and for decades highschool and colleges have offered and required classes with the curricula we hope about ... with very disappointing results so far.      While nothing in the diary directly involves feminist research about behavior formation and change it does all offer insight into how humans come to think/believe/feel and behave as they do socially and politically (in the sense of power behavior even aside from party affiliation). Especially under the influence of powerful nonconventional “teaching” that saturates American society in every direction and at every phase of idea formation. Most of it not even come from political sources — instead it’s the overt and covert commercial messaging not least as embedded in popular culture for leveraging fairly basic human drives in order to sell products.      Full disclaimer: no I don’t understand 100% of the terms and concepts in this kind of research. I read and learn more as I can because it’s highly insightful about bad{sic} human behavior in multi-dimensional ways that news items on their own cannot begin to encompass by reporting only on ‘events’ as they occur.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research suggests that there is a common neural system implicated in reward-learning for both non-social (e.g. monetary) and social rewards. For example Izuma et al. (2008) found that both positive feedback regarding one's reputation and receiving a monetary reward activated an overlapping aspect of the striatum. Indeed the striatum is engaged during trial and error-based learning tasks (Daniel and Pollmann 2014) and reward-based learning tasks (Lin et al. 2012) regardless of the type of reward received. Moreover Hausler et al. (2015) found that the reward of scoring a goal in soccer vs winning money activated similar regions of prefrontal cortex and striatum… Together these fMRI findings suggest that a common neural system is likely involved in reward processing for both nonsocial and social rewards.  <big>📌</big> Greater involvement of action simulation mechanisms in emotional vs cognitive empathy 15 February 2018 Some advocate that empathy may be facilitated through the embodied simulation or internal representation of perceived experience in others. Empathy is crucial for successful interpersonal interactions…  Action-perception matching or action simulation mechanisms has been suggested to facilitate empathy by supporting the simulation of perceived experience in others. However this remains unclear and the involvement of the action simulation circuit in cognitive empathy (the ability to adopt another’s <tt>perspective</tt>) vs emotional empathy (the capacity to share <tt>and react</tt> affectively to another’s emotional experience) has not been quantitatively compared. ...Conjunction analyses [of tasks by subjects in this study] revealed common recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) thought to be critical for action-perception matching during both action simulation and emotional but not cognitive empathy. Furthermore activation was significantly greater in action simulation regions in the left IFG during emotional vs cognitive empathy and activity in this region was positively correlated with mean feeling ratings during the emotional empathy task. These findings provide evidence for greater involvement of action simulation mechanisms in emotional than cognitive empathy...  <big>📌</big> Risk-taking Peer-influence and Child Maltreatment: a Neurocognitive Investigation.

Moralistic ideologies involving group chauvinism and religion are arguably the most socially impactful—and at times the most perniciously divisive...  People cleave to ideological convictions with greater intensity in the aftermath of threat. The posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) plays a key role in both detecting discrepancies between desired and current conditions and adjusting subsequent behavior to resolve such conflicts. Building on prior literature examining the role of the pMFC in shifts in relatively low-level decision processes we demonstrate that the pMFC mediates adjustments in adherence to political and religious ideologies...  <big>📌</big> Altered Amygdala Connectivity in Urban Youth Exposed to Trauma Might early life trauma produce changes in neural connectivity which impact emotional response and alter interactions with the world later in life?  December 09 2015 <big>📌</big> Engaged Listeners: Shared Neural Processing of Powerful Political Speeches What is happening in the brains of a captivated audience?

October 07 2015 <big>📌</big> Neural Mechanisms Underlying Human Consensus Decision-Making. Neuron Volume 86 Issue 2 22 April 2015 Pages 591-602  Consensus building in a group is a hallmark of animal societies yet little is known about its underlying computational and neural mechanisms. Here we applied a computational framework to behavioral and fMRI data from human participants performing a consensus decision-making task with up to five other participants. We found that participants reached consensus decisions through integrating their own preferences with information about the majority group members’ prior choices as well as inferences about how much each option was stuck to by the other people. These distinct decision variables were separately encoded in distinct brain areas—the ventromedial prefrontal cortex “The vmPFC has been implicated in diverse functions ranging from emotion and emotion regulation to episodic and semantic memory to economic valuation ”posterior superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction and intraparietal sulcus—and were integrated in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings provide support for a theoretical account in which collective decisions are made through integrating multiple types of inference about oneself others and environments processed in distinct brain modules.  <big>📌</big> Self-Other Mergence in the Frontal Cortex during Cooperation and Competition. Neuron Volume 91 Issue 2 20 July 2016 Pages 482-493. HIGHLIGHTS ■ People confuse their own performance with the performance of others ■ Cooperation leads to positive and competition to negative self-other confusion ■ Confusion is reflected in area 9 indicating interdependent self-other processing ■ Learning from own performance history is represented in perigenual ACC.  SUMMARY To survive humans must estimate their own ability and the abilities of others. We found that although people estimated their abilities on the basis of their own performance in a rational manner their estimates of themselves were partly merged with the performance of others. Reciprocally their ability estimates for others also reflected their own as well as the others’ performance. Self-other mergence operated in a context-dependent manner: interacting with high or low performers respectively enhanced and diminished own ability estimates in cooperative contexts but the opposite occurred in competitive contexts. Self-other mergence not only influenced subjective evaluations it also affected how people subsequently objectively adjusted their performance. Perigenual anterior cingulate cortex tracked one’s own performance. Dorsomedial frontal area 9 tracked others’ performances but also integrated contextual and self-related information. Self-other mergence increased with the strength of self and other representations in area 9 suggesting it carries interdependent representations of self and other.  <big>📌</big> Aggression Influenced by Genetic Environmental Factors August 24 2020 — Genes and environment (including the human environment) are factors in individual aggression itself... “...a complex triad of emotion cognition and behavior. The emotion is anger the cognition is hostility and the behavior is aggression. And they sort of go in that order..."  said Dr. Emil F. Coccaro in a presentation for the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists annual conference that year. Although aggression can be thought of in numerous ways premeditated and impulsive aggression are most relevant to behavioral studies in psychiatry… Premeditated aggression is goal oriented while impulsive aggression comes from frustration or a response to a threat. Impulsive aggression is "typically social or frustrative in nature and studies [show in part the tendencies] that [aggressives] move toward a threat while nonaggressives move away ..." Both types of aggression can be seen in the same individuals at different times. Aggression also can be considered using a threshold model. Calm individuals for example might have a low baseline of aggression and a high threshold before they act out. An aggressive person on the other hand has a lower threshold and a higher baseline level. "Their delta to get to the point where they're going to explode is much shorter much lower than it is in someone who is healthy..." "...the threshold to explode is probably regulated by various neurobiological features. The baseline state of aggression also may be related to baseline neurobiological features but also what's going on in the environment because the neurobiological features that send someone to exploding aggression are there all the time..."      The article explains that secondary aggression tends to stem from an underlying primary disease of the brain systemic or metabolic disorder or a psychiatric one such as schizophrenia. "If someone's ... got voices telling them to hurt somebody or delusions that someone's going to hurt them that's not primary aggression that's secondary to the psychosis..."      In contrast primary aggression is likely to involve intermittent explosive disorder (IED). Strangely (in my view) IED was an aspect of "passive-aggressive personality" in DSM-I (1952) then DSM-II (1968) as "explosive personality" then disorder IED in DSM-III (1974) as a diagnosis of exclusion Coccaro considers poorly operationalized — DSM-III criteria for IED didn’t look to define numbers of recurrent outbursts what they looked like the time frame and excluded general impulsivity. "That's not really what these people look like and it's not what impulsive aggression looks like..." DSM-IV (1994) merely removed some exclusion criteria apparently.      Since 2013 we’re in the um controversial DSM-5 era god help us defining IED as  ...verbal and physical aggression without destruction or assault twice equally on average for 3 months or three or more episodes of physical destruction/assault over a 1-year period. These individuals have outbursts "grossly out of proportion to provocation" the aggression is generally impulsive and it causes stress and impairment with an age of onset at older than 6 years…. <big>📌<big>The Basal Ganglia and the Cerebellum in Human Emotion 2020 The basal ganglia (BG) and the cerebellum historically have been relegated to a functional role in producing or modulating motor output. Recent research however has emphasized the importance of these subcortical structures in multiple functional domains including affective processes such as emotion recognition subjective feeling elicitation and reward valuation….  <big>📌</big> Becoming the King … Identification with Fictional Characters is Associated with Greater Self-Other Neural Overlap. 2021  ...During narrative experiences identification with a fictional character can alter one's attitudes and self-beliefs to be more similar to those of the character. The ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) is a brain region that shows increased activity when introspecting about the self but also when thinking of close friends. Here we test whether identification with fictional characters is associated with increased neural overlap between self and fictional others. Nineteen fans of the HBO series Game of Thrones performed trait evaluations for the self 9 real-world friends and 9 fictional characters during functional neuroimaging. Overall participants showed a larger response in the vMPFC for self compared to friends and fictional others. However among participants higher in trait identification we observed greater neural overlap in the vMPFC between self and fictional characters. Moreover the magnitude of this association was greater for the character that participants reported feeling closest to/liked the most as compared to those they felt least close to/liked the least. <big>These results suggest that identification with fictional characters leads people to incorporate these characters into their self-concept: the greater the immersion into experiences of "becoming" characters the more accessing knowledge about [fictional] characters resembles accessing knowledge about the self.</big></big>      If true of fictional characters what are the implications in regard to sports idols political heroes mass media pundits demagogues of any stripe...      </big>All this in mind consider seductive powerful societal mechanisms operating far more constantly in our lives than educational institutions do. In broadest sense popular culture most of all. Which plays on basic bio-psychological drives. Can curriculum alone pose an adequate counterbalance? After all most students resent education on principle especially if so privileged as to imagine not needing it much in order to have the lives they desire.      But current-wave feminism doesn’t reject popular culture nearly as much as 2nd wave feminism did. Not nearly as much as the entire 60s/70s progressive movement did. Because since then manufacturers of popular culture constantly adapt to how to gratify rejection away —how to keep us feeling pleased satisfied and even partnered by the drug upon society that most popular culture is no matter how camoflaged. And they have hundreds even thousands of new-minted graduates in psychology and biology each year wanting jobs and not squeamish about qui bono.      E.g. films like WonderWoman (or Black Panther etc) aren’t made to comply with genuinely revolutionary values and they embody none — they’re dressed-up retreads of the same messages reliably feeding us the illusion that our societal agonies are being championed and our demands met. Popular music the same: on close look at artists who seem to be rebels we see their rebellions take forms remarkably attractive and seductive in familiar ways. Popular culture is both a product we consume and that consumes and shapes us playing on our dreams for life to be as we wish it was leaving little impetus to take effective real-world action as we imagine that action being taken for us by by someone more powerful.  Infantilism and paternalism — we are relieved of sense of responsibility to shoulder the work ourselves far less take risks in that cause.       We’re now in an era of much more hopeful signs. One is a paradox that any time there’s hundred$ of million$ to be gleaned by identifying and playing to a newly lucrative “market” (a.k.a. audience) that IS entertainment that will be made. The makers only require reasonable evidence that it’ll BE a profitable product (and hopefully addictive) that the target audience (not a coincidental expression) now has money to burn on that product. Making it appear to comply with the target’s hopes demands & dreams is just good business strategy. Always has been ever since masses of people began to gain spending power … roughly a century more or less.      The total American female market the total American minority market and others (not the poor of course) have had increasingly more money to blow on entertainment since the ‘60s because civil rights and the 2nd wave did in fact open doors to more kinds of livelihood than before building upon advances carved out by their World War II experiences (that generation in turned having built upon hardwon gains from before). For women we can see pre-war films of smart strong women succeeding in men’s world — essentially an illusion contrary to all reality but so gratifying and such fun that women bought it and men didn’t mind.     The present moment has its own comparable addictives. Hopefully mixed in with what may be more genuine food for the soul but one swallow doesn’t make spring.      Not with daily horrific and appalling news of violence and coercion of women and minorities. BUT! — the reason it’s in the news at all is because there is now a much more profitable market/audience for it and growing. These things have always been happening but most of the market didn’t want to be confronted with it. Now more of the market demands it bee seen. Since advertisers want the opportunity to persuade us to buy the products and services it profits them to keep us addicted to for-profit news-delivery has to deliver it. And because of the competition to corner the market for-profit news has to meet production criteria that overlap entertainment in satisfying us. Hence “if it bleeds it leads”... but ONLY if who bleeds is someone who matters to a profitably large enough money-to-spend-enough viewership/readership/audience/market.      (Including at this site: we read here therefore we are progressive is the gratifying credo. No need to conduct our lives in any straitly progressive ways not even here — e.g. hatred of people different from ourselves is quite popular here. No need to get out in the real world with sleeves rolled up shoulder to shoulders with others applying elbow grease to the machineries of change unless we actually choose to.)      Nothing takes the push out of a liberation movement like pleasing the strongest bulk of it blunting their power with satisfaction/gratification leaving the unentertained minority small insignificant and figuring as unreasonable demanders whose noise creates obstacles to their success. ...while the gratified (entertained) majority go on being “taught” by entertainment product placement and advertising about how to behave in order to get the life they want. And how to not behave to avoid getting the sticky end of the lollipop.      Nationally/federally this country might now possess the potential to build upon all progressive eras that came before. The catch is the bills have not yet come due: we’re spending with no clarity about where the wherewithal will come from. But popularly we’re seeing very encouraging wins in entertainment industry awards that seem to reinforce political/govt’l prospects. But again we can’t tell yet how this is all going to play out. Should we relax and trust that the champions infantilists and paternalists will take care of us women and minorities at last?      History suggests otherwise. And as is famously said failure to learn those lessons means repeating them with all painful karma involved. What are all the ways critical for change-making teaching and learning? Keep thinking about that. Keep finding more ways. History teachers that there can never be too many.  YMMV of course.      Free further reading in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (wik: Ψ) “a bimonthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering social neuroscience published by Oxford University Press.
