L, Musings for Friday - The Chauvin in Chauvinism. It's All in the Name - Edition, TexDem, 2021-04-23, I bet it had already crossed your mind and you’ve been meaning to look it up. Or maybe you have and only found the definition and not the origin. The quick answer is yes. Yes chauvinism comes from the name Chauvin.   Originally it wasn’t a reference to male chauvinism. The word male only defined the kind of chauvinism   (ˈʃəʊvɪˌnɪzəm) n Whether intentional or not Derek Chauvin was the epitome of a word derived from his surname. Derek Chauvin openly displayed his feeling of superiority with the smug look he displayed as he looked directly into the cameras pointed at him as he held his knee of George Floyd’s neck taking his life. His smugness betrayed his feeling that he could kill a man in broad daylight and there was nothing those observing could do about it. In the moment he was right. But he was wrong when he thought he would pay no consequences one brave 17 year old girl helped see to that.    Chauvinism excessive and unreasonable patriotism similar to jingoism. The word is derived from the name of Nicolas Chauvin a French soldier who satisfied with the reward of military honours and a small pension retained a simpleminded devotion to Napoleon. Chauvin came to typify the cult of the glorification of all things military that was popular after 1815 among the veterans of Napoleon’s armies. Later chauvinism came to mean any kind of ultranationalism and was used generally to connote an undue partiality or attachment to a group or place to which one belongs. Without doing an in-depth psychological interview we can speculate what kinds of Chauvinism Derek Chauvin displayed. Two are most obvious of which race would be the first Second would be as a police officer gazing upon civilians. Neither are good for society. Race we see and recognize because unfortunately we see it all to often in every day life. The phrase Thin Blue Line has come to define the latter as much as the twisted take Blue Lives Matter.     Whenever most of us talk about Black Lives Matter we know that there is an unspoken Too that comes after Matter. But unfortunately those using the jingo Blue Lives Matter aren’t thinking Too they’re thinking More.     The smug irrational belief in the superiority of one's own group (in this case we’re referring to Law Enforcement Officers LEOs) is dangerous not just to those of the Black community. Chauvinism like hatred has to have a target and if the usual target is no longer around what happens then?     The next time you wonder about the origin of a name or phrase don’t hesitate to look it up. None of us are too old to learn something we didn’t already know. And yes someone will come in here and proclaim they already knew this. And in so doing displaying their own form of chauvinism.
