L, previous guy declares himself 'deadbeat dad of the vaccine' and those 400000 deaths, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-04-29, Charlie McCarthy’s cousin Kevin claimed POTUS Biden’s speech could have been an email as previous guy claimed paternity for vaccine development that wasn’t even his. Remember when Trump and Kushner declared 60000 American deaths to COVID-19 “a great success story”. .@GOPLeader: “Republicans will work with anyone to build America up...” 🤡 pic.twitter.com/tw2RHJ6gbV Maria Bartiromo asked her guest about the FDA’s decision to pause the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after very rare instances of blood clotting raised concerns which Trump dismissed as a “stupid thing to do.” Trump then pivoted to the set of American citizens who are hesitant to get the vaccine which polls suggest is largely comprised of his own base of supporters.  “There’s a big situation with a lot of people don’t want to take the vaccine” he said before blaming the J&J vaccine pause for adding to skepticism among those who aren’t eager to get vaccinated. Reports surfaced earlier this month that the 45th president and the former First Lady Melania Trump received vaccinations in January but did so in private. Many have suggested that had they publicly announced that they were vaccinated or did it during a press opportunity then many of his supporters would be more likely to get vaccination themselves. www.mediaite.com/...

Biden on the other hand entered office in the midst of a raging pandemic with 500k deaths 400k of which were due to Trump's malevolent incompetence. Funny how the press underplays that...  One year ago the cumulative number of US cases surpassed 1 million and the death toll exceeded the number of American deaths in the Vietnam War.The same day when asked what will happen if states reopen before there’s a coronavirus vaccine Trump says “It’s going to go away.” pic.twitter.com/HX3dTgvmvW  WATCH: Full Video and Transcript of President Joe Biden's Address to Joint Session of Congress https://t.co/i0D1FrhRYm
