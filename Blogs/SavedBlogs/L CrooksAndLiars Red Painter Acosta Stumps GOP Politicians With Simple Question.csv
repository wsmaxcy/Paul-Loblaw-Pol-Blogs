L, Acosta Stumps GOP Politicians With Simple Question, Red Painter, 2021-07-05, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Jim Acosta attended a pathetic MAGA Rally held by The Former Guy and had a chance to speak with quite a few GOP politicians about why they still support TFG if they believe the Big Lie (no surprise they all think the election was stolen) and a bunch of other questions. The pathetic fealty and groveling they do in the hopes of taking the mantle and getting the MAGA base to support them is pathetic even by political standards. I wrote this tweet about the clip: Excellent segment right now on CNN with @Acosta at a rally talking to GOP politicians about why they still support him when he continues to push the Big Lie.The fealty they still give TFG is pathetic. — Red (@Redpainter1) July 4 2021 The responses were golden: Fealty. a feudal tenant's or vassal's sworn loyalty to a lord.  Nails it. Well said. — Ghostwriter (@krankee099) July 4 2021 Obviously: It's a Cult... — Lanna (@Lannatexasgal) July 4 2021  pic.twitter.com/Dd3ca8Gpgd — Annemarie Hofman (@HofmanHofma6) July 4 2021 I think this nailed it: He gave them permission to be their worst selves and they will never abandon him as a result. — Nancy Terreault (@NancyTerreault) July 4 2021 And in response to another clip: I believe the Ma Cawthorn Homeschool Education System failed young Maddie.  Some politicians play dumb … @CawthornforNC isn’t playing. — Moe Davis (@ColMorrisDavis) July 4 2021 Never forget that Madison admires Hitler. Not joking. Madison Cawthorn believes the justice system failed US. pic.twitter.com/XOoqgeLzxb — Outspoken (@Out5p0ken) July 4 2021 I agree. Kid should be working the Taco Bell drive thru window … — Theodore (@PinkosTheodore) July 4 2021 @CawthornforNC is the essence of cultism.“I think the election was stolen but have no basis.”“There’s plenty of proof but I can’t point to any.”“The fact that 60 cases were thrown out of court doesn’t mean my claims are without merit it means that the system failed.” — Calabrin (@DanteDLT) July 4 2021 A cult.
