They say stupid **** almost on a daily basis and do a disservice to the people they supposedly represent by giving out misinformation and outright lies. Source: Courier Journal Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. tweeted Saturday that members of the U.S. military have contacted him saying they will 'quit' if forced to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The tweet which had more than 7000 likes by Monday has caused controversy on Twitter as others on the platform informed Massie that members of the armed forces cannot simply "quit" the military.   Massie wrote in the tweet "I've been contacted by members of our voluntary military who say they will quit if the COVID vaccine is mandated." I’ve been contacted by members of our voluntary military who say they will quit if the COVID vaccine is mandated.I introduced HR 3860 to prohibit any mandatory requirement that a member of the Armed Forces receive a vaccination against COVID-19.It now has 24 sponsors. https://t.co/lbqYESmBYy — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) July 3 2021 So what happens to anyone who does what Massie says they'd do? Once a member of the military reports to their first duty station they are contractually obligated to remain within the service of the U.S. armed forces according to the Military Benefits website. Leaving without sanction or quitting is considered AWOL or absent without leave. If that military member leaves with no intent of returning then it becomes a more serious charge of desertion. A retired Major had this blunt advice for Massie. As a retired Air Force officer I’m amazed at your lack of understanding of how the military works. Stay in your lane. You’re already fucking up North Carolina stay away from the military. — Dr. Steve Woodsmall Major USAF-Retired (@SteveWoodsmall) July 4 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
