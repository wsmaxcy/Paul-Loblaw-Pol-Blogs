L, Museum Pieces: Woodrow Wilson's Boyhood Home, Lenny FlankforHistory for Kossacks, 2021-06-29, I have always been fascinated by Woodrow Wilson who is sadly one of our forgotten Presidents. Wilson was a complex person and in many ways he seemed contradictory. He won office by vowing to keep the US out of the First World War yet he was the one who declared war on Germany. His program for peace emphasized the end of colonialism and the right of self-determination yet domestically he was an unabashed advocate of white racial superiority and was it was whispered a supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. He considered himself a liberal defender of political rights yet he launched a fierce campaign of repression against anarchists socialists and war critics. He passionately supported internationalism with his League of Nations but was also an unapologetic nationalist who sent troops all over South America to enforce US interests. He was simultaneously a man far ahead of his time and a man inextricably caught up in his time. I consider him to be one of our most historically significant Presidents. So when I found myself in Augusta GA I took the opportunity to visit his boyhood home. "Museum Pieces" is a diary series that explores the history behind some of the most interesting museum exhibits and historical places.  The 1912 Presidential election was a bitter three-way contest. Until this time the Republican Party formed on the eve of the Civil War to fight for an end to slavery was the progressive party in the US favoring political and economic reforms such as union rights women’s suffrage regulation of corporations and workplace safety laws. All of these were in turn opposed by the Democratic Party which represented the social and economic conservatism of the Old South and the wealthy Eastern robber barons. When the Republican President Teddy Roosevelt decided not to run for re-election in 1908 his Vice President William Howard Taft was elected instead. But Roosevelt who was inflexible with his ideas of what should be done decided that his former protégé was not doing the job. At the 1912 party convention he challenged Taft for the nomination and when Taft narrowly won anyway Roosevelt left the Republican Party formed his own Progressive Party (which quickly earned the nickname “Bull Moose Party”) and ran for the Presidency as a third-party candidate taking most of the Republican Party’s reformists along with him. Meanwhile a political shift was also happening inside the Democratic Party. The party had not won the White House in 20 years and a dissenting faction based mostly in the liberal north and known as the “Social Democrats” now argued that the traditional conservative platform was outdated and unpopular and advocated a new reformist approach that was similar to the one Roosevelt was proposing. Woodrow Wilson had won election as Governor of New York on a reformist platform and now the progressive wing of the Democratic Party saw him as their champion. After a hard fight against the entrenched party hierarchy Wilson won the party nomination in 1912. Taft found himself at the head of a broken party and he soon faded in importance. That left Roosevelt and Wilson to duke it out and since their positions on so many issues were pretty much the same the differences between them turned mostly on their respective personalities. Roosevelt was loud brash and not hesitant to unilaterally use Presidential power to run things the way he thought they should be run. Wilson on the other hand was a scholarly and quiet intellectual a former university president who tried to deal with issues using logic and reason. But in the end the election was really decided by simple math: since Roosevelt and Taft were splitting the Republican votes between them that left Wilson as the only one who could get a majority. Wilson got only 42% of the popular vote but won 435 of the 531 electoral votes. Immediately upon assuming office in 1913 Wilson introduced a comprehensive package of legislative bills to carry out the political and economic reforms he wanted—the first President to do so. One of these was the Revenue Act of 1913 which lowered the tariff rates on foreign imports and imposed the first direct income tax in the US since 1872 taking a one percent cut of annual incomes above $3000 (which made up about 3% of the US population). Later on the eve of World War One this tax rate was increased to 15%. Next Wilson targeted the large corporations and holding companies (known as “trusts”) that were dominating the economy. Teddy Roosevelt had won his progressive reputation as a “trust-buster” by trying to break up some of these immense monopolies and now Wilson followed suit. The Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed monopolistic and predatory business practices and the Federal Trade Commission was established with the power to investigate monopolies and break them up in the public interest. The banking industry came in for special attention. Most other countries had a government-owned national bank but Andrew Jackson had destroyed the Bank of the United States back in the 1830s. The financial Panic of 1907 however convinced many that there needed to be some central authority that could set an overarching fiscal policy and oversee a flexible money supply which could be altered to prevent financial crises in the future. Not wanting to repeat the political fiasco of Jackson’s “bank war” Wilson introduced the Federal Reserve system which acted as a compromise between those conservatives who wanted a private banking system and the progressives who wanted a national bank. Under the new system there would be 12 privately-owned Federal Reserve Banks who would each be in charge of a region of the country and they would in turn be overseen by a central Federal Reserve Board that was appointed by the President and given the power to issue directives and set fiscal policies. Wilson’s program was largely supported by progressives but provoked much opposition from the conservative elements within his own party. Ultimately Wilson’s policies would force a shift in party alignments: as Teddy Roosevelt’s progressives abandoned the Republican Party and flocked to the Wilsonian reformers the old-fashioned Democrats left and joined the remnants of the Republican Party. From now on the Democrats would be the progressive reform party and the Republicans would be the pro-business conservative party. Wilson hoped to be able to focus his Presidency on domestic affairs and hold to the traditional isolationist line that the US had followed since the Spanish-American War. But isolationism did not apply to Central America which both the progressives and conservatives saw as “America’s backyard” and which both sides viewed with frankly imperialist ambitions. In 1914 the Panama Canal officially opened and this along with the growing economic importance of Latin American trade led to an increased American willingness to use military force in the region to protect its interests. By 1916 Wilson had sent United States troops to Nicaragua the Dominican Republic Haiti Honduras Panama and Cuba. Latin Americans soon began referring to the US as “The Octopus of the North”. The most serious issue was in Mexico. In April 1914 Mexico was ruled by military strongman Victoriano Huerta. The United States hoping to establish a democratic government began supporting a dissident named Venustiano Carranza and sent troops to seize the port of Veracruz cutting off the supply of European weapons (mostly from Germany) to the Huertista forces. Huerta fled and Carranza assumed the Presidency in July. Within a short time though conflict broke out again in Mexico over the land reforms desired by the more radical rebels.  When it became clear that Carranza would not carry out any real land reform both Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata broke away. In October 1914 60000 rebel troops under Villa and Zapata entered Mexico City and forced Carranza to flee. In April 1915 though General Alvaro Obregon defeated Pancho Villa in the Battle of Celayas and Carranza returned to Mexico City with the backing of the United States. Villa now desperate retreated into the deserts of northern Mexico. On March 8 1916 Villa gathered his forces at Palomas on the American border across from the town of Columbus NM. The US Army had a small outpost there of 400 troops at Camp Furlong. It’s not entirely clear why Villa had decided to attack the US. Most historians have concluded that he hoped to provoke the Americans into sending troops into Mexico which would incite a widespread nationalist uprising against Carranza. In any case around 500 of Villa’s troops crossed the border and entered Columbus at 4:15am on March 9. (It’s not clear whether Villa was actually with them.) Much of the town was set aflame and 8 US troops and 10 American civilians were killed. Wilson ordered General John “Black Jack” Pershing to take a force of 10000 US Army regulars dubbed the “Punitive Expedition” into Mexico to find Villa. But Villa was an experienced guerrilla fighter and knew the terrain well and although the Americans fought a few minor skirmishes they were never able to find the Mexican commander. Meanwhile popular resentment in Mexico grew as the American troops wandered around the countryside and in January 1917 under domestic political pressure Carranzas withdrew his permission for the expedition and asked the US to pull out from Mexico. While all this was going on meanwhile the “Great War” had broken out in Europe. The “Central Powers” of Germany and Austria-Hungary had long been at odds with the “Entente Alliance” of France England and Russia and when the heir to the Austria-Hungarian throne was shot and killed everyone had the excuse they needed for the war that they wanted. “The World War” stretched from German submarines in the Atlantic to Japanese attacks on German bases in China. By 1916 both sides had fought to a standstill—and both sides recognized that if the United States entered the war with her full industrial strength it would be decisive. Wilson declared American neutrality and for the most part the public who had little desire to get sucked into the bloody European quagmire supported him. Even when a German U-boat torpedoed the British passenger liner Lusitania in May 1915 killing 1200 civilians including over 100 Americans Wilson maintained his neutrality. “There is such a thing” he grandly announced “as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right.” In the 1916 elections Wilson won (by a slim margin with just 49.2% of the vote) under the campaign slogan “He kept us out of war”. It is not a policy Teddy Roosevelt would have followed. But the rather naïve American notion that as a new economic power they could stand aloof from the rest of the world could not last for very long. In January 1917 the Germans resumed their policy of unrestricted submarine warfare and several British ships were sunk with American passengers. The next month the British turned over a secret coded telegram they had intercepted from Berlin to the German Ambassador in Mexico offering German support if Mexico would invade the US. It was more than even Wilson could take and in April 1917 the United States formally declared war on the Central Powers. “We have no selfish ends to serve” he asserted. “We desire no conquest no dominion ... no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of the nations can make them.” Wilson’s idealism transformed the “Great War” into “The war to end all wars” fought to “make the world safe for democracy”. But despite Wilson’s grand ideals the United States was unprepared for war. The US Army was small and ill-equipped lacking all the machine guns aircraft and tanks that were needed for trench warfare in Europe. The only recent American military experience was in beating up the decrepit remnants of the Spanish Empire and in ineffectually chasing Pancho Villa around Mexico. Despite a crash program to build up its forces as quickly as possible the United States wasn’t able to begin sending significant numbers of trained American troops (armed mostly with French weapons and equipment) to Europe until the summer of 1918. But despite their inexperience the fresh doughboys and the economic power behind them proved to be decisive against the battered and war-weary Germans. American loans kept the Entente Allies in the war and under command of General Pershing American soldiers joined in the joint French and English fall offensive that broke the German lines. The war ended in November 1918. At home however the First World War proved to be one of the most unpopular in US history. A significant part of the population still remained isolationist in its views while many in the progressive movement denounced the war as an imperialist venture fought on behalf of large capitalist corporations. When the US began drafting soldiers for the war it sparked even greater outrage. Wilson replied with the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 making it illegal to criticize the war effort or the US government. Thousands of people were arrested for making anti-war speeches or writing anti-draft pamphlets. The political Left was widely targeted for its anti-war stance particularly the Socialist Party and the IWW. In the resulting “Red Scare” there were mass arrests and deportations of suspected anarchists and socialists. When the 1920 election came around the Socialist Party candidate for President Eugene V Debs ran for office from his prison cell where he was awaiting trial for sedition prompting what surely must be the most unique American campaign slogan ever: “Vote for Prisoner 9653”. Eventually all of these arrests were ruled unconstitutional. By the time Wilson and the American delegation arrived in France in 1919 to draw up the formal peace treaty with Germany however the role of the United States on the world stage had changed. America was now the preeminent economic power in the world and a top-rate military force as well. As a result even though the US had joined the war late Wilson had a leading role in setting the peace terms—and he took full advantage. He came prepared with a list of Fourteen Points that he intended to be the basis for the peace treaty covering everything from “no territorial gains” to “self-determination for colonial people”. But the most important of the Fourteen Points for Wilson was the establishment of an international “League of Nations”. This would be a global alliance of nations with the power to bind its members to democratic principles including freedom of speech and the free practice of religion the authority to settle disputes through an International Court of Justice and the right to use military force to punish transgressors and prevent future wars. To Wilson’s disappointment the most effective opposition to the League of Nations concept came from the United States. Legally the US Senate had to approve the treaty and that led to a bitter conflict that divided mostly on partisan lines. For the most part the now-conservative Republican Party took an American nationalist stance and opposed international checks to US sovereignty. In the end they had enough votes to force changes to the treaty that would have weakened it and this was rejected by the Democrats. In the end no treaty was ratified. The League of Nations meanwhile went ahead without the USA. Wilson was crushed. On October 2 1919 as the League of Nations treaty was being debated in the Senate Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke that paralyzed his left side. His condition was kept hidden from everyone and First Lady Edith Wilson stepped in to control access to the President deciding what documents he would see and which officials would have access to him. By February 1920 word had leaked out to the public that the President had serious health issues though their true extent remained hidden. There was serious talk of having Vice President Thomas Marshall take over as President but that never happened. Edith would essentially set Wilson’s daily agenda for the rest of his term prompting some historians to dub her “The First Female President”. Wilson recovered enough to consider running for a then-unprecedented third term but Democratic Party officials refused to allow that. In the 1920 elections Democratic nominee James Cox was defeated by the Republican candidate Warren G Harding. Wilson lived in Washington DC until his death in 1924. In 1860 Presbyterian minister Joseph Wilson pastor of a church in Augusta GA moved into a two-story house on 7th Street. Along with his wife and two daughters Wilson had a three-year old son named Thomas Woodrow Wilson. In the house next store lived another pastor of a different church and Tommy Wilson’s best friend Joseph Lamar. The Wilsons lived there for the next ten years. In one of the upstairs bedroom windows visitors can still see the letters “TOM” which the young Tommy scratched into the glass using his mother’s diamond ring.Later Joseph Lamar would grow up to be a Supreme Court Justice and Woodrow Wilson would be President of the United States. The church where Lamar’s father was pastor was across the street from the Wilson house. During the Civil War it was used as a hospital and President Wilson later recalled seeing dead and dying soldiers on the front lawn. Today the Boyhood Home of President Woodrow Wilson is owned by the nonprofit Historic Augusta Inc. and is open for tours three days a week.
