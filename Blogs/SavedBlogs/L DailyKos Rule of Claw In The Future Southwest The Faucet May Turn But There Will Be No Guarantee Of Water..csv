L, In The Future Southwest The Faucet May Turn But There Will Be No Guarantee Of Water., Rule of Claw, 2021-06-28,  Some time ago in college I was given the privilege of being shown models of the future effects of climate change.  Some time ago I shuddered at what I hoped was hyperbole.  The maps showed a dystopian future in that essentially everywhere from Albuquerque up to the populations centers of Southern California would beome uninhabitable.  At press time the Phoenix/Las Vegas area was scheduled to top 118 degrees early the week of June 13th.  This is not wholly unusual. Indeed the all-time record for Phoenix Sky Harbor is 122 degrees in June of 1990.  But what has changed is the heat island effect in a sense locking Phoenix into a self-fulling prophecy human EZ-Bake oven. This is from 2007-I point out 2007 because it is much worse now. The monsoon may be the most talked-about weather feature of Phoenix in recent days but another weather-related phenomenon going on in the Valley is in effect 12 months of the year. It's the urban heat island or UHI a phenomenon that makes the Phoenix nighttime low temperatures 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than temperatures in rural areas. The reason for an increasing UHI is the growth of Phoenix as we build out farther and farther into the desert valley. Urban regions are among the most rapidly changing environments on Earth and Phoenix is the fastest-growing large (more than 2 million people) metropolitan area in the U.S. As a result the warming rate for Phoenix is one of the fastest urban-warming rates in the world for its population.  10-15 degrees warmer.  But surely humans will consider the consequences of their actions and stop developing areas better suited to a film location for a Spielberg film right?  You must be joking. Say “hi” to 25194 new neighbors. They pushed Phoenix way out in front making this the fifth year in a row that it is the fastest growing city in America. The 25194 new Phoenix residents this year is slightly below the 10-year average of 25912 however Phoenix continues to take the largest share of Maricopa County’s population growth with nearly four in 10 new county residents choosing to live in the city of Phoenix. Why?  Jobs.  Apparently Americans are willing to overlook the fact that it gets hot enough here to grill cheese on the hood of their car if it means they can pursue the American dream of a 2000 sq ft. house with a $1 per square foot electric bill.  Now I as the author have to be careful here for my house is (hot) glass.  We moved here in 2018 to help my wife get into the Mayo Clinic for her illness but have yet to purchase. But the population growth is so unmanageable that the apartment we rented for $1030 in April of 2018 is going for $1488 now.  For 730ish square feet.  Yet the people keep coming as we prepare to leave never to return. In fact at the current pace apartment rents in a place hot enough to allow you to relate to the feeling a pizza must have as the cheese melts is going to go higher than San Diego California.  San Diego is a place where the temperature rarely exceed 90 degrees farenheit has an amazing beach an open welcoming culture and a museum system absolutely second to none.  And it is better but not perfectly prepared to meet the demands of the future. San Diego County Has ‘Sufficient’ Water Supplies Through 2045  "Governor Newsom's latest drought emergency declaration is a grim reminder of the growing water supply challenges across California — and of the value of three decades of our collective dedication to use water efficiently combined with strategic investments that protect San Diego County from dry years" SDCWA board chair Gary Croucher said Tuesday. "Thanks to efforts of ratepayers the water authority and our 24 member agencies we have sufficient water supplies for 2021 and the foreseeable future." About 30% of the state's population is now covered by the drought declarations including the greater Sacramento area and Fresno Merced and Stanislaus counties in the San Joaquin Valley. Southern California has largely been excluded from the declarations. But the future for Phoenix is bleak at best.  Not blessed with natural resources and shackled with a political infrastructure dedicated to the Church of Asphalt current projections lead to a future like this: How jobbed is Phoenix?   Phoenix saw the greatest increase of average temperatures over the last 50 years in the U.S. according to Climate Central and the Weather Channel. The same report in the LA Times that predicts we’ll see 130-degree temperatures in the next 80 years. But what about that other desert palace the one known as Las Vegas?  They are not doing much better.  Also overdeveloped under-watered Governor Steve Sisolak has signed legislation requiring one third of greenery to be removed by 2026. The law will prohibit Colorado River water distributed by the water authority from being used to irrigate “nonfunctional turf” starting Jan. 1 2027. The authority has said this will include grass between roads and sidewalks in medians and traffic circles and decorative grass outside businesses housing developments and similar areas. Single-family homes golf courses and parks are excluded from the ban. But in order to understand the challenges the southwest faces let’s look at where Las Vegas gets its water from: Basically the area is getting no rain no runoff and despite its efforts to conserve water it is not getting any cooler either-because the trade-off with banning greenery is impacting negatively the heat island. To review-Governor Sisolak is trying to conserve water by removing uneccessary greenery which will in turn raise temperatures which will in turn impact the water supply. The future for these areas is bleak at best yet the people keep coming because science itself is a hot button issue.  Americans pick and choose their own facts to believe in and their own media to enforce their views and their own fantasy world in which to live. In this case a world that could frequently reach 130 degrees. In case you ever wondered what a warm cookie- felt like. -ROC Hey friends my cancer fight has turned more serious and has forced me to urgently change careers!  And-huge news!  My newsletter is live! Sign up here to subscribe!  It publishes every Wednesday and will be full of original reporting laughs and fun!
