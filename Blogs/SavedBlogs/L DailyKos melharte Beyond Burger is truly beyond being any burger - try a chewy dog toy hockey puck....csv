L, Beyond Burger is truly beyond being any burger - try a chewy dog toy hockey puck..., melharte, 2021-04-20, It fits the fiber requirements — that’s about it.  The ingredients?  28% fat which is far more fat than even moderately fat ground beef.  Coconut oil is the fat one of the unhealthier plant fats to be eating. While it grilled the smell was almost nauseous and had nothing to do with ground beef. Yes it gets close to a nice texture if you prefer your burger well done.  If you pile tasty stuff on top it’s like enjoying all that tasty stuff with a fiber fill puck added to chew on. Where’s that dog of mine? It’s far more expensive than organic ground beef. It comes packed in a sturdy plastic holder that could be recycled — but given that only 10% of recyclable plastic food containers in this country are actually recycled [the facilities just don’t exist because it’s expensive] the packaging isn’t green. The manufacturers might think about compostable plastic but they shouldn’t pretend the current packaging is “green.” Face it: nothing is ever going to measure up to a beef burger in flavor if you truly enjoy the flavor of ground beef [not just the texture of fully cooked beef which has little of the original beef flavor left].  Most carnivores probably know this by now. But there are plenty of other “burgers” based on vegetable fillings that are far more flavorful than beyond burger and even delicious.  My carnivore husband remembers some from as far back as 20 years.   Just get over the fact that a veggie burger isn’t meat enlarge your concept of what delicious can be and enjoy the world of vegetarian food on its own merits.  Indian vegetarian cuisine is just one example of how satisfying that can be.   In the meantime save your money and avoid the wannabe shams.
