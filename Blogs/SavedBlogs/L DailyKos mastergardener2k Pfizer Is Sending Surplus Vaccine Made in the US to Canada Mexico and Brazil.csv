Scientific American: “Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread influenza cases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to minuscule levels. The reason epidemiologists think is that the public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from spreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in much the same way as SARS-CoV-2 but they are less effective at jumping from host to host.” Looking for a vaccination appointment? hidrb.com vaccinefinder.org/… www.findashot.org How are vaccinations going in your state and county? www.washingtonpost.com/...
