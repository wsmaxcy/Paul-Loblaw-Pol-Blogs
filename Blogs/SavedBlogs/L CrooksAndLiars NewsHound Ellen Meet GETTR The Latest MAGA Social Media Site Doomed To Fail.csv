L, Meet GETTR The Latest MAGA Social Media Site Doomed To Fail, NewsHound Ellen, 2021-07-02, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Designed to look and act like Twitter it will even import your Twitter followers – without their permission as Politico notes. I'm sure it's just a wild coincidence that Miller a sleazy cad whose numerous marital infidelities include fathering a child while his wife was pregnant came up with a name for his platform that sounds misogynistic when you say it out loud. Although official launch date is not until July 4th (a declaration of independence from Big Tech!) the beta-version of the site has already hit some snags. According to Politico “the debut immediately ran into confusion” as to whether or not this is the social media site Donald Trump has been promising. Apparently not. Miller says he is reserving Trump’s Twitter handle for him but the former Tweeter-in-Chief has not yet signed up. But plenty of imposters have. Variety reported that the app was quickly populated with fake accounts. For example: At least two fake Trump accounts — ReaIDonaIdTrump (with capital Is in place of the Ls) realDonaIdTrump (with a capital I in “Donald”) — were created Thursday before the company deactivated them. Miller himself was impersonated on Gettr before the account @jasonmiller was suspended. Another bogus account @OfficialDTrump was still active as of press time with a single post: “I can now speak the TRUTH to all my patriots on this WONDERFUL app without my FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS being taken away!” (The First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting free speech and does not apply to private companies.) Gettr’s description in Apple’s App Store is hardly reassuring of either “America First” or quality: GETTR is a non-bias parentheses [sic] network for people all over the world. GETTR tried the best to provide best software quality to the users allow anyone to express their opinion freely. Politico wrote: Whether GETTR will succeed is dubious at best. Their last attempt to replicate [Trump’s] twitter feed a site called “From The Desk of Donald Trump” was widely derided as nothing more than a blog barely received any web traffic and shut down less than a month later.  But hey there’s still MyPillow guy’s Frank! Well at least for now. Twitter has thoughts too: GUTTER. https://t.co/2HwuqHYTBD — Molly Knight (@molly_knight) July 1 2021 i mean is this supposed to be tinder for Trumpers? is this just a very poorly chosen visual? https://t.co/mLfbPl1OpH via @politico — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) July 1 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
