C, Operation 2-1-2: Call Your (GA MI PA WI) State Legislators, Martin Knight, 2020-11-12, According to Article 2 Section 1 Paragraph 2 of the United States Constitution; Each state shall appoint in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress … I won’t mince words here; I believe Democrats in Fulton County in Georgia Allegheny County and Philadelphia County in Pennsylvania Dane County in Wisconsin and Wayne County in Michigan engaged in election fraud on a massive scale – effectively disenfranchising thousands of voters in the other cities and counties in these states.  There is more than enough compelling circumstancial and documentary evidence (including affidavits and sworn statements) in each state of voting irregularities statistically implausible margins and turn-out percentages single race ballots broken chains of custody improper barring of Republican observers etc. to justify a full in-depth audit (including forensic examinations of ballots) of the election in these four states – five if one includes Nevada. This phenomenon of late counting Democrat strongholds miraculously “finding” and counting tens of thousands of hithero unknown ballots days after the election in the dead of night when every other part of the state have conveniently reported their numbers has been happening for decades. King County and the Rossi/Gregoire race in 2004 (WA) Hennepin County and the Coleman/Franken race in 2008 (MN) Durham County and the McCrory/Cooper race in 2016 (NC) – all these followed the exact same pattern we saw now down to the media loudly repeating the circular argument that there’s no evidence of fraud therefore there is no reason to investigate any further. Indeed were it not for Marco Rubio sounding the alarm against the theft as it was happening in Palm Beach County the same thing would have happened in Florida in 2018. In that case both Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott would have been the victims. Scratch that – the real victims would have been the legitimate voters in the other 66 counties of Florida who through no fault of their own would have been disenfranchised by fraudulent ballots cancelling their votes. Which brings me to this; Operation 2-1-2. As it happens the Legislatures – who unambiguously have the power to appoint slates of electors – of the states of Georgia Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are all controlled by Republicans. Republicans whose constituents were robbed of their votes. Republicans who have a duty to stand up for their voters’ interests. Republicans who can order investigations and a full audit of the election results in one or two counties on pain of sending a Republican slate if they fail to cooperate fully with investigators. Republicans placed by the Constitution in a position to adjudicate and provide redress of wrongs done to their constituents. Operation 2-1-2 is about reminding these people these State Legislators that the people back home are paying attention and they expect them to act; to launch their own investigations to demand the opening up of machines records and ballots to call up witnesses and forensic experts to spare no effort and offer all support to the President as he conducts his investigation and gathers his evidence for their consideration. In other words if you live in Georgia Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Michigan gather round a couple hundred of your closest friends and write call email and phone your State House and Senate member (Republicans especially) and let them know you’re watching. It’s time to do their jobs.
