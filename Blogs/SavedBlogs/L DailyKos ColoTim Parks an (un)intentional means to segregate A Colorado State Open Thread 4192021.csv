L, Parks an (un)intentional means to segregate? A Colorado State Open Thread 4/19/2021, ColoTim, 2021-04-19, The Colorado State Open Thread is for people to share their interests in Colorado be they readers from Colorado hoping to travel to Colorado or just curious about our home.  We welcome comments criticism and even stories to help everyone understand our state and we even are happy to have input from curious bystanders.  Sometimes I even find diaries to highlight that weren’t originally designated for the Open Thread but I will link to them to help them gain a broader audience. Such is the case today.  While reading DailyKos I came across an interesting diary by grog that talked about efforts to change the way people use Denver’s city parks.  Essentially there have been people advocating over the years and even decades to shut off roads through parks like Denver’s City Park so that people aren’t going to risk being hit by cars as they go and enjoy the parks.  One outcome of this has been that the people who live next to the parks become the major and in some cases only people who are able to go to these parks because the people who used to go to the parks can’t get there for reasons of distance difficulty in getting there (people with mobility or other disability reasons) and in several occasions they cannot do the types of activities they want to do in the park because they cannot drive there. We lived in Denver for about eight years (much longer in the metro area but Denver proper only eight years) and this park pictured above was the one I would visit on a daily basis.  Usually it was to walk my dogs but sometimes for other reasons.  The park as you can see had large areas of green grass pretty shade trees and a picnic shelter along with a playground and about six picnic tables and grills clustered in one area.  There was one parking lot and some walkways going across the park but no roads going across the park.  People would use it to play games on lie in the grass and soak in the sun sometimes let their dogs run chasing frisbees or balls (leashes were required but that wasn’t strictly observed) and the shelter could be reserved for parties.   The parties varied considerably.  Some were for birthdays or other celebrations.  Some were neighborhood gatherings where they could enjoy a park and spread out which was likely unavailable at their homes due to space reasons or because perhaps they had neighbors who wouldn’t like such a large gathering.  Sometimes there were just a few people in attendance but often the parties would be upwards of forty or fifty people.  Many times they would bring extra tables chairs and grills.  A few times every summer they would bring sound systems (they would also have to bring generators since there was no power available) and occasionally I would even see things like rented bouncy-castles set up.   Even with no roads across the park the people who would set up for the party would bring the heavy items (tables chairs sound food grills etc) in their cars and pickups and drive on the sidewalks over to the location of the party drop everything off and then go park in the parking lot.  Sometimes they would keep a vehicle there to supply power or just make it easier for loading up at the end of the party.  This particular group was likely from the immediate neighborhood of the park.  We had white and Hispanic families living around the park (just a short distance from South Federal) and the ability to use roads/sidewalks to access this park was a major factor in how people accessed it and utilized the structures.  If they couldn’t bring their vehicles in to unload and load party supplies I do think the park wouldn’t be used by some of the people who use it today.  And that would defeat some of the reason for preserving and protecting the park.   I wanted to raise this issue and invite people to go visit Grog’s diary (it’s in the Community Spotlight section on the Front Page as well as the link in the story above).  Read up on the issues in some of the large Denver parks think about what you might want for the parks and comment in grog’s or this diary so your thoughts can be read.  I also hope you might have some information about other locations in the state.  I know that Denver in general has relatively low outdoor greenspace for the size of the city it is and some of that is up in the mountains rather than down in the city where it could be visited much more often.  Colorado has places including Rocky Mountain National Park where the land is being loved to death — RMNP had the third highest visitation of any National Park in the system and that doesn’t include the areas like the National Recreation Areas that are in and around major cities like New York LA and the San Francisco Bay.  It is a challenge to try and preserve and protect natural areas while still allowing for people to use them and to have them be used in the way that different cultural groups want to experience them (not everyone uses trail bikes or wants to picnic on grass in a park believe it or not).  Last year during Covid restrictions RMNP implemented a reservation system for the park during the summer months to limit and try and spread out visitation.  This year they’re doing it again with the Bear Lake road being managed differently than the other roads in the park because of the very high visitation.  It’s frustrating for someone living in Estes Park that I can’t go visit the park without planning a month in advance but the NPS hasn’t figured out how to try and accommodate both the locals and the travelers.  There are busses to get in the park if you don’t have the vehicle pass but I haven’t tried them yet.  I will likely do that though. I look forward to reading your thoughts in both diaries and I welcome you to drop any other thought you might have below if you want to talk about something else.  This is an open thread after all.  The floor is yours.
