L, Six years ago Dad passed..., jtg, 2021-05-04,  Six years ago today May 4 2015 my father James Espy Green died. I had been his caregiver for 15 years. In that time we had been together almost every day and on those days when he was in the hospital or visiting one of my siblings we would speak on the phone. His loss still touches me every day. It is also the 27th anniversary of my cancer surgery when I had my colon cancer tumor removed and got a permanent colostomy. I am often told by my doctors and nurses when they learn I’ve been such a long-term ostimate that it is very unusual for someone to live so long with a colostomy. It is a constant reminder of how different I am from those around me. And it is Star Wars day.  #jtg
