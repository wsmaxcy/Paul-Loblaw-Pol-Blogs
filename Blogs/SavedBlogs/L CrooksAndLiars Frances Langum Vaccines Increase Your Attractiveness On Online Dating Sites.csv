L, Vaccines Increase Your Attractiveness On Online Dating Sites, Frances Langum, 2021-05-21, The LOOK on Fauci's face ALONE is worth the click.  White House announces online dating sites are offering incentives (?) to the vaccinated.   A visibly embarrassed Andy Slavitt soldiered through today's announcement that online dating sites such as Bumble Tinder OKCupid BLK and PlentyOfFish will have "I'm vaccinated" badges and filters.   Mashable reports that "OkCupid is teaming up with the White House to boost vaccinations in the U.S. and daters who make use of the badges will receive a free "boost" on their profiles." At Friday's White House Covid Briefing Anthony Fauci could be observed laughing as Slavitt announced that the "universally attractive" thing is getting the vaccine.   Slavitt also noted that OkCupid says people who are vaccinated have a 14% greater chance of a match than people who don’t plan to get vaccinated. "Alright got through that." said Slavitt with obvious relief at the end of his remarks.  We’d swipe right 😉Add your vaccination status to your profile on @Tinder @hinge @Match @okcupid @meetBLK @Chispa and @PlentyOfFish services as well as @bumble and @Badoo. #WeCanDoThis 🔗 https://t.co/EgQ6CHkKcb pic.twitter.com/CoIFisSVX9 — VaccineFinder (@VaccineFinder) May 21 2021 The White House: In support of getting 70% of adults at least one COVID shot by July 4 the largest dating apps in America will launch new features to encourage Americans to get vaccinated. — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 21 2021 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 The vaccine is actually helping people find love. Over 7 in 10 daters on @OkCupid said they will get the COVID-19 vaccine and those who are planning to get it or already have are getting 14% more Matches and 15% more Likes. — Michael Kaye (@MichaelKayePR) May 21 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
