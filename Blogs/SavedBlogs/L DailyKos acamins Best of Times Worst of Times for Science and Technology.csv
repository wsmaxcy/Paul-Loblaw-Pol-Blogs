L, Best of Times Worst of Times for Science and Technology, acamins, 2021-06-27, Paul Kalb and Arthur Camins The Covid-19 pandemic is waning in the United States yet resistance to vaccination remains a major impediment to widespread immunity.  Wildfires severe weather events and destructive habitat change are more common place yet almost one in five Americans still deny the clear cause – climate change.  Former president Trump and his Republican allies weaponized and took science denial to an unprecedented dangerous level  equating evidentiary claims with self-serving opinion.  In light of these challenges the mantra from politicians to “Follow the science” is a welcome change.  However effective vaccine distribution and necessary advances in clean energy production will take a lot more than political rhetoric. Limited public understanding of and confidence in the processes of science and technology has created a best of times and worst of times crisis.  While the public is increasingly exposed to the iterative nature of science and uncertainty analysis too many people associate science with some of its negative technological applications such as food additives pollution and uncontrolled greenhouse gases.  This dynamic and its deadly and destructive impacts pose an existential challenge. Resolution depends on informed participation in democratic decision-making. We are at an inflection point and it’s up to scientists and science educators to do the heavy lifting to convey how science and engineering can contribute to improving the human condition.  System Models: Scientists develop complex models to represent multiple interacting variables related to weather geological and biological systems over time to assess and predict climate change. Advances in instrumentation and big data processing have reduced some uncertainties while uncovering new variables. So revised scientific predictions are not capricious but based on evolving evidence and improved models. Iteration is inherent in the process.    Engineers rely on results from scientific models to design solutions to human problems.  For example models enabled the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that we need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the next 10 years to stop global warming before reaching the point of no return.    What seemed like a Mars-landing level undertaking just a few years ago now appears to be within our grasp.  Solar cell efficiencies have greatly improved (more than doubled in 10 years) and the cost of mass-producing photovoltaic solar panels plummeted over 64% from $7.52/watt in 2010 to $2.71/watt in 2019.   Similarly the cost of wind turbine generated electricity dropped from $0.07/kWhr in 2009 to $0.02/kWhr in 2020.  Iteration: Building knowledge is seldom a “eureka!” moment of individual discovery or invention. It is the product of rigorous step-by-step work by teams with diverse expertise in which knowledge expands and uncertainty shrinks.    The battle against the Covid virus is a good example.  Health care professionals urged caution based on initial uncertainty about how the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus infected cells and how it spread.  We washed our hands 50 times a day and took rigorous precautions when opening packages or mail inside our homes.  With more data scientists determined that the predominant mechanism for its spread was through breathing respirable particles from people who were “shedding” the virus (even those who were asymptomatic). This iterative knowledge process led to increased emphasis on wearing masks avoiding large gatherings indoors and social distancing whenever possible ultimately saving millions of lives.    Values: Decision-making in the face of uncertainty requires evaluating the best available data and model output quantifying the uncertainties considering potential consequences and assessing risks.  But ultimately decisions are based on whether and how those choices impact the quality of our lives.  For example the decision to stop the Keystone XL pipeline project was made based on evaluating the environmental risks of potential leaks as well as greenhouse gas emissions from increased use of fossil fuels and how each of those outcomes impact local communities and the nation as a whole.  Science will facilitate our understanding of issues related to human health and changes in earth’s climate. But this is a life and death battle against the clock. We need the commitment and resolve of society at large and must do whatever it takes to counter and overcome science-hesitancy now.                                                          Every K-12 school and college as well as science engineering and health institutions must be explicitly targeted to emphasize that science and technology are the basic tools needed to improve the quality life of every human being.  Specifically curriculum must stress that knowledge development is an iterative process models and uncertainty analysis are effective predictive tools and risk assessment/relative risk are a critical part of the overall decision-making process. Effective communication and education are key and now is the time to act swiftly and decisively.   Paul Kalb recently retired from Brookhaven National Laboratory where he worked for over 40 years as an environmental engineer developing environmental remediation and sustainable energy technologies. Arthur H. Camins works part-time with curriculum developers at UC Berkeley as an assessment specialist.  He retired recently as Director of the Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education at Stevens Institute of Technology. He has taught and been an administrator in New York City Massachusetts andLouisville Kentucky
