L, Black Kos Tuesday's Chile: It Burns., Black KosforBlack Kos community, 2021-04-27, It Burns Commentary by Chitown Kev This afternoon I’m kinda on empty although… Well… As I’ve stated I really had no appetite for watching the Derek Chauvin trial. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired of watching Black people being treated as if they were in televised Colosseum games by both white cops and even white civilians. I’m glad that much of the stuff that Black people have had and still have to go through gets caught on camera. Following the Chauvin trial through tweets DK trial threads that gchaucer and other Kossacks did and occasional snippets from MSNBC news programs sufficed to keep me updated. And then the verdict came down...guilty on all counts...and I totally expected what a portion of the “reaction” by American law enforcement would be. Daunte Wright (yes I know that Mr. Wright was killed prior to the end of the Chauvin trial...but his killing belongs with this list) Ma’Khia Bryant Adam Toledo Isaiah Brown Andrew Brown Jr. I anticipated it. It’s why in spite of the understandable jubilation about the Chauvin guilty verdicts by some I was ambivalent about the verdict myself. Well not ambivalent but...I’m really not all that optimistic that things will change all that much immediately. And then there were a few of the totally predictable comments and conversations here and there about Black folks and forgiveness and being able to forgive white people (especially white cops) for these crimes. I have written about my own positions on forgiveness on a couple of occasions and I don’t think that I have much more to say on the subject really. Well...there is this... What strikes me is that a whole lot of white people want to hold Black people to a standard of forgiveness that even they cannot and are not even willing to reach for themselves. And that particular bit of hypocrisy simply...burns. That’s it that’s all. Taking place after the events of Marvel’s “Avengers: Endgame” film “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” follows Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) pursuing a group of anti-nationalist super soldiers called the Flag-Smashers. The duo tries to work independently of Captain America’s replacement John Walker (Wyatt Russell) who is trying to call all the shots.  The series has been enjoyable but “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” has been a mixed bag on the topic of race. Though the plot carries the usual “good guys vs bad guy” intrigue the main backdrop is how individuals and society wrestle with the complicated legacy of Captain America.  Race and racism are clear and present subtexts but the series frequently sends mixed messages regarding what it thinks about these issues. The two characters that highlight this ambivalence the most are Sam Wilson and John Walker. Sam Wilson served as Steve Rogers/Captain America’s flying sidekick and friend. Rogers passes the baton to the Falcon but Wilson decides that retiring Cap’s symbolic shield is the right thing to do. Wilson is aware of the discimination African Americans face and how Black people are forced to comport into forms of respectability to preempt anti-Blackness. This is evident in a scene where Wilson says to his sister “You know I don’t play with these white folks” assuring her of his preparedness to go to the bank and secure a loan to save their family boat. We also see Wilson experience racism in Episode 2 when the police see Wilson and Barnes arguing. The police stop to make sure that Wilson is not “bothering” Barnes.  This was supposed to be Chadwick Boseman’s night. After rolling through most of awards season Boseman was a favorite to win at Sunday's Academy Awards. He was supposed to win for the memorable career he had for the signature roles we’ll never see and for the “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” character that encompassed everything he did so well in one cocky complicated cornet player. The Oscars which usually announces its top prize – Best Picture – last even appeared to foretell a Boseman win by making the best actor award the finale. (Fun fact: The Academy has ended with best picture every year since 1948 aside from 1972 when Charlie Chaplin closed the night with an honorary award.) Why wouldn't the Academy Awards finish its show honoring all that the beloved performer did in his career before his death last August too young at 43 after a long battle with colon cancer? But no. Anthony Hopkins who turned in an exceptional performance in "The Father" won. (And he wasn't there to accept bringing an already strange ceremony to a clunker of an anticlimax.) Hopkins' performance was worthy of an Oscar perhaps in any other year. Here's the thing: We're going to see that Hollywood legend again. The same can't be said of Boseman.  We didn’t have him for very long though what Boseman did over the course of less than a decade was an amazing singular achievement that the Academy had a chance to celebrate but disappointingly whiffed. He embodied and never imitated a trio of Black icons: Boseman made us feel the hatred and racism faced by Jackie Robinson (2013’s “42”) the first Black player in Major League Baseball; he stirred up excitement singing and dancing as James Brown (2014’s “Get On Up”) the Godfather of Soul himself; and he embraced the civil-rights crusade of young lawyer Thurgood Marshall (2017’s “Marshall”) before he became a Supreme Court Justice. “An execution” was the first response of one of the few people allowed to see a snippet of the video that showed the police-involved shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. After numerous delays officials in Elizabeth City N.C. finally allowed the family and representatives of Andrew Brown Jr.—who was killed by a Pasquotank County sheriff’s deputy on April 21—to view video footage of his death. Before Brown’s relatives watched the footage of the police shooting officials declared a state of emergency apparently in preparation for outrage and protests. The viewing was rescheduled from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m on Monday after officials in Elizabeth City and surrounding areas issued emergency declarations citing a possible “period of civil unrest” according to the New York Times. “We want to say from the outset that we do not feel that we got transparency” said attorney Ben Crump during a press conference. “They only showed one bodycam video even though we know there were several bodycam videos.” Crump who is representing the family along with Bakari Sellers and Chantel Cherry-Lassiter said county and state officials refused to allow the Brown family’s legal team to see the video. Sellers noted that County attorney R. Michael Cox told him that “he was not fucking going to be bullied” into giving the family their constitutional rights to representation because Crump and Sellers were not members of the North Carolina Bar Association. Cherry-Lassiter and the family however were eventually allowed to see a 20-second snippet of the video. The bodies of the two brothers were left for more than a day. Their families knew they were there but the soldiers wouldn’t let them collect the bodies. The soldiers left behind witnesses though: two boys barely teens tied to a tree nearby after the soldiers forced them to spend the night on the ground between the bodies of the murdered men. The brothers were Kahsay and Tesfay who both cared for young children and elderly parents in a small village in the northeastern corner of Ethiopia’s Tigray region in an area home to the Irob a small ethnic minority. Their homeland on the border with Eritrea has known unrest for decades from the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998 and the years of tension that followed until a shaky peace deal was finally reached in 2018. Nothing compares to what they’re seeing now. “It was never like this” said Fissuh Hailu of the Irob Advocacy Association. Before he said “We had places to run away.” A vaccine against malaria has been shown to be highly effective in trials in Africa holding out the real possibility of slashing the death toll of a disease that kills 400000 mostly small children every year. The vaccine developed by scientists at the Jenner Institute of Oxford University showed up to 77% efficacy in a trial of 450 children in Burkina Faso over 12 months. The hunt for a malaria vaccine has been going on the best part of a century. One the Mosquirix vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline has been through lengthy clinical trials but is only partially effective preventing 39% of malaria cases and 29% of severe malaria cases among small children in Africa over four years. It is being piloted by the World Health Organization in parts of Kenya Ghana and Malawi. The Oxford vaccine is the first to meet the WHO goal of 75% efficacy against the mosquito-borne parasite disease. Larger trials are now beginning involving 4800 children in four countries. Prof Adrian Hill director of the Jenner Institute where the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine was invented said he believed the vaccine had the potential to cut the death toll dramatically. “What we’re hoping to do is take that 400000 down to tens of thousands in the next five years which would be absolutely fantastic.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
