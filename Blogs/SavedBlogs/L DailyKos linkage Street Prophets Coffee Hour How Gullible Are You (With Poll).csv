L, Street Prophets Coffee Hour: How Gullible Are You? (With Poll), linkage, 2021-05-03,  This is an Open Thread / Coffee Hour and all topics of conversation are welcome.  Today is a simple open thread. How are you doing today? What is for dinner? What is on your mind? All topics of conversation are welcome. If you are new to Street Prophets please introduce yourself in the comments below. Perhaps the prototypical hoax is Orson Welles's The War of the Worlds radio broadcast. The Wikipedia article suggests 1.7 million believed it to be true. Welles's "War of the Worlds" broadcast has become famous for supposedly tricking some of its listeners into believing that a Martian invasion was actually taking place due to the "breaking news" style of storytelling employed in the first half of the show. — from Wikipedia. For today's coffee hour beyond the fold I'm asking everyone to share any stories of hoaxes you have fallen for. As always what is for dinner? How are you doing today? What is on your mind? This is a Open Thread / Coffee Hour. Please limit community links to one per user because we want to encourage greater diversity of submissions of community links from different users. In the case of a needed fundraiser either the member in need will write a diary or someone will do it on their behalf. That diary is then linked to in the comments. Please only post community links in community links comment provided. Some of the "proven" hoaxes in the poll are from a list of hoaxes found on Wikipedia. If you follow the links there is the "evidence" disproving the hoax. Art's Parts and the Montauk Project are not on the Wikipedia list but are worth noting. Art Bell hosted a late night paranormal-themed radio program Coast to Coast AM. This show had on it guests that discussed many topics that some might consider hoaxes. I loved the show because it stretched my imagination. And I guess enjoy all the alternative paranormal theories and Art's hosting because he never quite believed his guests and he asked intelligent questions. He always left it up to the listener to decide for themselves if it was true. Thank you for stopping by today. This is a Open Thread / Coffee Hour.
