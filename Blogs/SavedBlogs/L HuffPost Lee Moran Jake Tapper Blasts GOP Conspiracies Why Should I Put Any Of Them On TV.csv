L, Jake Tapper Blasts GOP Conspiracies: 'Why Should I Put Any Of Them On TV?', Lee Moran, 2021-05-05, CNN’s Jake Tapper again called out elected Republicans who lie and peddle conspiracy theories asking: “Why should I put any of them on TV?” The anchor’s Sunday “State of the Union” show has not booked any elected Republicans who back ex-President Donald Trump’s election lies since January. Tapper appearing on Tuesday’s broadcast of “New Day” likened some Republicans to Doritos. “You can’t just do one” he said. “You keep lying and lying and lying.” He listed some of the falsehoods pushed by Republicans in recent weeks ― from Trump’s election falsehoods and baseless claims that President Joe Biden wants “to steal your hamburgers for climate change” to their appeasement of COVID-19 deniers and followers of the bonkers QAnon conspiracy theory. “The lie about the election on its own is anti-democracy and it is sowing seeds of ignorance in the populace and obviously has the potential to incite violence” said Tapper. “But beyond that is if you’re willing to lie about that what are you not willing to lie about?” “I happen to believe that this country needs a strong thriving healthy fact-based Republican Party” Tapper continued. “We need those debates happening. But we can’t have those debates if one side of the argument is not willing to stick to standards and facts” he said. “How am I supposed to believe anything they say? If they’re willing to lie about Joe Biden wanting to steal your hamburgers and QAnon and the big lie about the election what are they not willing to lie about? Why should I put any of them on TV?”  Watch the video here:
