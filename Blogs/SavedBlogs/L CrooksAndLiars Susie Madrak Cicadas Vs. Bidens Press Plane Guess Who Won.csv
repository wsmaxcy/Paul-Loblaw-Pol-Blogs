L, Cicadas Vs. Biden's Press Plane: Guess Who Won, Susie Madrak, 2021-06-09, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Dozens of journalists were delayed in their attempt to cover President Biden's trip to Europe when the infamous cicadas that once-every-17-years plague clogged the plane's engines. Via the New York Times: Somehow the flying insects had filled the plane’s engines grounding it and forcing Mr. Biden’s aides to scramble for another way to ferry the reporters overseas. What was supposed to be a 9 p.m. departure was delayed until 11. And then until 2:15 a.m. Perhaps it was inevitable with billions of cicadas flying around much of the eastern United States in recent weeks. In the nation’s capital where a brood that emerges every 17 years is near its beastly peak they have crawled up the necks of TV journalists splattered across car windshields and gotten tangled in the hair of anyone braving the swampy 90-degree heat. White House travel officials delivered news of the insect malfunction to reporters gathered at the airport hotel along with assurances that a new plane was headed to Washington from New York. A new pilot in Cleveland was soon to be en route — and both officials hoped would make it safely through the cicada cloud which has been dense enough around Washington to be picked up on weather radar.
