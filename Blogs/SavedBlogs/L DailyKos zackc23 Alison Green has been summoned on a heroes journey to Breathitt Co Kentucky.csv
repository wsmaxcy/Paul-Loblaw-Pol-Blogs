L, Alison Green has been summoned on a heroes journey to Breathitt Co Kentucky, zackc23, 2021-05-03, www.dcreport.org/… Alison Greene wrote a blog post a few months ago.  It seems to be finding a second life here and elsewhere.  I could write up a nice long post about ancestral Democrats who now vote GOP low voter turnout in 2014 vs the high turnout of 2020 or voter registration being a lagging indicator of actual politics on the ground but I don’t have the time or the eloquence.  I simply suggest that Alison Greene fly to Lexington rent a car and drive to Breathitt County.  She then can go door to door finding this mythical McGrath majority she has wished into being.  Breathitt has about 12.5k people who are about 99% white in a very rural very poor county in a very rural very poor very white state.  Please Alison.  Please come and find the Democrats who would vote for Amy McGrath the Democrat running against 30 year incumbent Mitch McConnell on the same ballot with Donald Trump on a ballot that allows party line voting with Trump’s name at the top.  Please help me find them.  I’d love to find them.
