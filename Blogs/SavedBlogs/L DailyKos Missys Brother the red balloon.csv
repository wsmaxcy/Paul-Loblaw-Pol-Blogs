L, the red balloon, Missys Brother, 2021-04-26, Leticia Flores-Gonzalez knew the toll that the coronavirus pandemic life was taking on her twin daughters Gianella and Luna. No more learn-and-play sessions invitations to birthday parties and their nearby playground was blocked off with orange tape.  Leticia started involving the twins in more arts and crafts projects. One such project in early December was sending their Christmas wish lists to Santa on red balloons. Leticia took a photograph of their letters as she never expected to see them again. The balloons were released on a super windy and cold day from their home in Liberal Kansas. Leticia didn’t expect the balloons to go any further than Liberal.  But Luna’s red balloon traveled more than 500 miles to Shreveport LA. It was found by retired Alvin Bamburg while hunting for deer two days before Christmas when he spotted the red balloon with a note attached stuck in a fallen tree. It was a four year old girl’s note to Santa stating that she had been nice that year.  Bamburg posted his finding on Facebook and within 24 hours located Luna. Leticia hesitated to contact Bamburg back but with her family’s encouragement that it was a once-in-a-lifetime thing she was convinced that she should.  Four or five boxes of gifts were shipped to the girls including gifts for Leticia and her husband. Bamburg said he didn’t want to leave anyone out. Yet there was still one last thing that the girls had not received from their lists and that was a puppy.  Apparently the girls had been asking for a dog after having to put down their twelve year old Chihuahua in March of last year. Leticia and her husband had been trying to find a small dog for the girls even searching in Texas and Oklahoma to no avail. Bamburg ran into the same problem while trying to locate a shelter puppy for them. Luckily his veterinarian daughter knew a dachshund breeder that offered a puppy when she heard about the red balloon. The breeder let Bamburg take the pick of the litter. Bamburg met the family in Oklahoma City and surprised the girls with the puppy Max.  Leticia and Bamburg communicate almost daily with Max updates and how the girls are getting along with him. The two families plan to meet again in May in Oklahoma City. Leticia and her husband are possibly planning a trip to Louisiana this year. Bamburg stated “It didn’t matter race or color. I was their instant step-uncle or step-grandfather.” Bamburg has a history of various opportunities where he supports people in small ways such as paying for a family’s groceries.  One little girl’s red balloon brought two families together who now consider each other family. And a little puppy has found a loving family to be his own.  Reading about this tonight in my local evening paper brightened my day and I thought it would yours too. I love the name of the town where the girls are from — Liberal.
