L, Facebook Oversight Board Keeps Trump Ban In Place -- For Now, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-05, The oversight board said Facebook should reevaluate in six months from now. Via the Washington Post: Facebook’s Oversight Board on Wednesday upheld the social network’s decision to ban former president Trump four months after Capitol riot but also gave Facebook six months to review the decision. Facebook banned Trump indefinitely following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol citing posts that it said encouraged violence. The binding ruling by the 20-member Oversight Board which is largely independent and funded by the social network could set the stage for a new political era online reshaping the way speech by public officials and other powerful people is moderated by social media companies. [...] Critics have argued that Facebook should have banned Trump at different points throughout his presidency saying that his inflammatory language and frequent promotion of misinformation — about the coronavirus in particular — constituted an abuse of his office and of Facebook’s own community standards. But chief executive Mark Zuckerberg felt strongly that politicians should be given wide latitude because their speech was in the public interest. The Board has upheld Facebook’s decision on January 7 to suspend then-President Trump from Facebook and Instagram. Trump’s posts during the Capitol riot severely violated Facebook’s rules and encouraged and legitimized violence.  https://t.co/veRvWpeyCi — Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) May 5 2021 The Board also found Facebook violated its own rules by imposing a suspension that was ‘indefinite.’ This penalty is not described in Facebook’s content policies. It has no clear criteria and gives Facebook total discretion on when to impose or lift it. — Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) May 5 2021 Within 6 months of today Facebook must review this matter and decide a new penalty that reflects its rules the severity of the violation and prospect of future harm. Facebook can either impose a time-limited suspension or account deletion. — Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) May 5 2021 Facebook cannot make up the rules as it goes and anyone concerned about its power should be concerned about allowing this. Having clear rules that apply to all users and Facebook is essential for ensuring the company treats users fairly. This is what the Board stands for. — Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) May 5 2021 Go read the whole thing. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
