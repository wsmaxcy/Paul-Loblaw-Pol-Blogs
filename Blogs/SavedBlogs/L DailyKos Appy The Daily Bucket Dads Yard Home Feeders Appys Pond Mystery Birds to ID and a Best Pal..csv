We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below. In a moment of quiet I walked around dad’s yard admiring the beauty that remained. My mom had planted lots of flowers and flowering bushes that had taken a hit over the past four years but here efforts had left a mark.  I’m going to have to trim these but am waiting for them to end their flowering phase. They’ve grown into the drive.  I spent a good deal of energy fighting back against an invasion of listeria encroaching from the fence line where the neighbor has planted them. The vines were strangling everything within their considerable reach. One of the very nice thing’s about dad’s yard is the incredible trees shading the house from every direction. The oaks are huge and the cedar shading the patio he built has grown large as well. There used to be an amazing old cottonwood that looked over all other trees on the street. It was over 200 years old. The neighbor lady came over and said she was going to have to get it removed as it was a threat to her empty old house built under it. The tree straddled the property line. As I stood looking at that humongous stump it it struck me that I haven’t yet embraced the fact that dad’s yard is now at least temporarily my yard.  I took a pic of this sassy Robin perched in one of the big oaks in the front yard.  Finished my work for that day and headed home over the Wagon trail. Being home is such a treat. I have no neighbors except for the wildlife my horses and dogs and the beautiful young cat in the barn loft. My bird feeders are usually very active and the pond draws attention from a surprising number of guests. We don’t have ducks visit all that often but I love it when they do.  Remember this spring egret in the trees on the banks of our pond?  That’s enough pond for now. I’ll head back to the cabin to check on the feeders and try to upgrade my photo album for each of the species that visits. Was happy to get some very nice shots of that beautiful Blue Grosbeak but I’m not picky. I know I can do better than I have on most all the birds that visit.    Here are a couple of pics I had high hopes for that did not turn out for me. I’m not sure what the problem was but they just looked like silhouettes in the sky. I’m not positive what they are but I think I know. I added a bunch of light to one and zoomed it up to get an advantage.  Don’t be disappointed thinking that’s the Mystery Bird for this Bucket Edition. That is coming up and it’s a real doozy! But first I took what I think is kind of an artsy pic of a Crow while I was doing chores at the main barn this evening.  Okay time for the doozy Mystery Bird. It is definitely a first for me and I still do not know what it is. Neither does my 1966 Birds of America handbook and neither does my current Audubon app. I know by the long legs it’s a wader. The long pointed beak tells me it’s a fisher. When I saw it sitting in the tree near our pond I thought it was a crow! When it squawked it sounded like a Crow choking on a marshmallow. I still thought it was a Crow until I uploaded and added a whole bunch of light. Look close and give it your best shot. I’m all ears. I got two pics for you.  There ya go. NAME THAT BIRD!  You probably thought that was the end of this diary right? Nope. I saved the big finish for a pic of another of my pards here at home. With that one we’ll ride right into the comments which is where we all work together to make a diary as good as it can be.
