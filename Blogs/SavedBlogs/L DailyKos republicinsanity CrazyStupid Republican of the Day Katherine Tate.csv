L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Katherine Tate, republicinsanity, 2021-07-03, Welcome to what is the 998th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Katherine Tate a 2018 candidate for U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi’s 3rd Congressional District who absolutely should not be confused with Catherine Tate the brilliant English actress who portrayed one of Dr. Who’s all-time best companions and was Nellie on the original UK version of The Office. No the Mississippi Republican Katherine Tate we’re profiling is spelled with a K although we wouldn’t be shocked to find out she spells it with three of them.Yes this should be an easy explanation…. Katherine Tate actually posted several times about Facebook to defend her family’s history of owning a plantation and how they owned slaves saying “They were well treated members of the family” and how they were “worse off” after emancipation. Now as bad as that bit of revisionist history is her social media also had a pattern of maligning billionaire philanthropist George Soros calling him “Satan” and sharing a number of conspiracy theories about him while also claiming that Muslims on London were running secret slave markets presumably not as wholesome as her idea of the Christian ones her ancestors did. She defended Confederate monuments of course in other posts.Just in case anyone was unsure that Tate was a reality-challenged individual she turned some heads during the GOP Primary debate for the seat by proposing the solution to mass shootings as “Get the federal government out of this godless Marxist statist anti-god anti-Christian control of schools.“ And when you mention some variant of Judeo-Christian God oppression three times in one sentence we’re not sure if you’re trying to summon the Anti-Christ like Beetlejuice or if you’re just raving mad.While being incredibly racist hasn’t been a deal-breaker for Republican voters in Mississippi at any point since 1965 or so we are relieved to say that Katherine Tate only got 416 total votes for 0.6% of the total tally and has since remained out of American politics. We’ll drink to the thought of her staying out.       One Year Ago July 3rd 2020: Fern Shubert (NC)Two Years Ago July 3rd 2019: Carl Nett (KY)Three Years Ago July 3rd 2018: Kelli Ward (AZ)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago July 3rd 2017: Kelli Ward (AZ)… 2017 UpdateFive Years Ago July 3rd 2016: Kelli Ward (AZ)… Original ProfileSix Years Ago July 3rd 2015: Dale Mensing (CA)
