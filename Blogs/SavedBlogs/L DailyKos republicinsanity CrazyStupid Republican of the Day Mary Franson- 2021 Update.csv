L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Mary Franson- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-23, It was on this date in both 2018 2019 as well as 2020 that “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” profiled Mary Franson who was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in yup you guessed it in the 2010  Tea Party Wave. Had we to sum her up in but a few words we would sum it up with “off-brand Michele Bachmann”. Her voting record represents that what with votes across the board for any anti-choice legislation a vote for a transphobic bathroom ban votes against same sex marriage and votes against raising the minimum wage during the greatest period of income inequality in our nation in at least a century.It isn’t just a matter of Franson being homophobic like Bachmann either she’s fine with outright hating all sorts of people who disagree with her… Democrats mass shooting survivors the poor… in fact the only quote we can find about her sticking up for another person is Roy Moore who she sees as a victim and not a racist old pedophile (more on that in a moment). So brace yourselves and get ready for the deranged roller coaster that is Mary Franson… And yet in spite of all that Republicans felt no need to have anyone run against Mary in the primary for her seat in the state legislature and because of the conservative make-up of that district she still coasted to victory with 68% of the vote. We can only end this post by posting the link again to the time Franson released a video on Facebook Live where a gust of wind blew the campaign sign she was holding around so it spun and smacked her in the face. It’s the little things that help.
