L, Newt Gingrich Tells FOX News that Biden's Agenda that the Majority Supports is Anti-American (?), News Corpse, 2021-04-25, Whenever you hear Republicans bring up "traditional" values it's a safe bet that the speaker is a hypocritical slimeball. Case in point Newt Gingrich showed up on Fox News Saturday to commiserate with Jeanine Pirro on how dreadfully amoral they think Democrats are. For the record that's the thrice-married Trump-fluffer Gingrich and the divorced tax cheat and "Big Lie" peddler Pirro opining on other peoples morals. During the segment Gingrich delivered an extended sermon asserting his predictably hostile perspective on President Biden. It will surprise no one that Gingrich is a political foe of all things Democratic however this particular outburst was even more malicious and dishonest than his usual bombast. Gingrich began with an ad hominin insult about "Every idiotic thing that the Biden administration has done in the first 100 days" but then failed to identify a single thing that would qualify as being "idiotic." His elaboration just got even more distant from reality: And I've never seen anything like it. Somebody asked me this afternoon and I told them I couldn't imagine any administration which had been this deliberately anti-American and this deliberately committed to infuriating the majority of the American people."  “attacking people of traditional values who are appalled that this administration would fly the gay flag at American embassies” - Wut? pic.twitter.com/oJV6QBUsen  Gingrich is articulating a definition of "traditional values" that is composed entirely of support for mass murder by unregulated firearms opposition to women having control of their own bodies and a firm commitment to blatant homophobia. Which makes his value system one of gun worshiping misogynism bigotry. That may be consistent with right-wing religious zealotry but not with the values enshrined in the Constitution. What's more Gingrich's assertion that Biden's positions are "anti-America" is downright preposterous. And he knows it. He is enough of a political animal to have seen the polling on the issues he raised. And on every one of them the American people are aligned with Biden and the Democrats.   Consequently if anyone is anti-American it's Gingrich and his GOP confederates. They are consistently opposed to the priorities of the American people. Every Republican in Congress just voted against the broadly popular COVID relief/stimulus bill. And they are set to do the same to the infrastructure/jobs bill that just passed in the House. They are rejecting these bills on purely political grounds even though majorities of their own constituents support them. That's about as anti-American as you can get. Talk about "infuriating the majority of the American people."  UPDATE: Also trolling the "anti-American" theme is Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. She posted this glaringly ignorant tweet suggesting that Biden's patriotism is suspect because there wasn't an American flag behind him in his climate change Zoom summit with world leaders. She mistakenly said that... Um yes we do. It was just the angle and framing of the video. So much for Fox "news" research and reporting. It's also a lie. pic.twitter.com/pQ5SvHJq9w  NOTE: Twitter recently suspended the News Corpse account after 11 years without giving a reason.
