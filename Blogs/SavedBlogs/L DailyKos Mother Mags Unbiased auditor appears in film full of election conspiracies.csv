L, 'Unbiased' auditor appears in film full of election conspiracies, Mother Mags, 2021-06-27, That’s what Arizona Senate President Karen Fann said about Cyber Ninjas’ CEO Doug Logan when she hired his firm to conduct the audit of Maricopa County’s 2020 election—that he was “unbiased.” So what’s Logan doing starring in The Deep Rig a film funded by former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne that’s a laundry list of every election conspiracy imaginable—from the farthest fringes of the QAnon universe. Just think about that for a minute. The man in charge of auditing Maricopa County’s election — the one who Fann has said will produce an “unbiased” review of our vote — is now appearing in a film chock full of conspiracy theories backed up by nothing more than QAnon crazies and wishful thinking. The Deep Rig is based on a book Byrne wrote and he says all book and movie profits will go to the American Project a nonprofit he started to fund the Maricopa County audit. So far he’s donated nearly $2 million (you can stream the shit-storm for $45 or host a showing for $500). Joining Byrne and Logan in the movie Michael Flynn appears wearing a QAnon patch and says the Arizona audit findings will be a “bombshell.” Then the talking heads run through their “proof” most of which has been debunked in court or in the world called reality.   Unlike yours truly reporters at Arizona Mirror were willing to pony up $45 to attend the film’s premiere yesterday at Dream City Church the same Phoenix facility where trump held a rally last June for 3000 people crammed together at the height of the pandemic’s killing season. The church’s pastors said they had a magic air system that filtered out Covid. They had no such thing and the Arizona AG sent them a cease and desist order. But the damage was done and who knows how many people got sick and died because they went to see that narcissistic blowhard. So there’s Doug Logan in the movie being exceptionally unbiased and all: “If we don’t fix our election integrity now we may no longer have a democracy” Logan says towards the end of the film. Logan also said in the film before he was unmasked that he believed that the CIA or former members of the intelligence agency may be involved with “disinformation” around election fraud. Logan did not provide any evidence to back up this assertion.   Senator Fann I don’t think that word “unbiased” means what you think it means. That’s probably why she and several other Stop the Steal goobers in the legislature attended the film’s opening yesterday because they’re also gathering unbiased research that proves the election was stolen. One attendee Sen. Mark Finchem was at the Jan. 6 riot believes the election was stolen and is running for Secretary of State because that’s who Arizonans want in charge of elections! Unlike most press except for the “official broadcast sponsor” OAN the Deep Rig team had complete access to the Coliseum floor even filming ballots and other voter information. Legitimate reporters were tossed from the building for far less. But it’s understandable that this professional gang would be provided access when you consider that they’re the team that produced Above Majestic a movie that proves aliens were behind 9/11. The aliens are totally unbiased.
