L, I Agree With Brett Favre: Second Degree Racism!, announ, 2021-04-22, I actually think Brett Favre is correct about Chauvin not meaning to kill George Floyd. But as I always tell my sons some of the worst outcomes in life are the unintended consequences of intentional acts: Don't shoot that rubber band for fun because on the other end of that fun might be someone losing an eye. Don't aim a gun at another person even if you think it's not loaded.Â  So Chauvin? Guilty of malice with forethought? No. That would be first degree murder. Guilty of being reckless with a black person's life because he couldn't have cared less about Floyd's humanity one way or another? Absolutely!  Like a lot of white people who though not guilty of first degree racism are absolutely positively guilty of second degree racism -- guilty of discounting black people's opinions regarding how we are faring in society where sometimes it really is hard to breath with all that's pressing down on us.  I can name Lord knows how many people who are as nice as can be. At the same time I'm pretty sure they are mainly concerned with getting what they consider theirs by right. They really never give a second thought one way or the other to what happens to people of color -- or the environment -- as long as they are comfortably situated. Its just not on their radar. And they are beginning to get a little peeved that people are trying to put it on their radar. Though they will deny it many modern conservatives are the perfect embodiment of second degree racism and the harm to life that results because like Chauvin to the camera and crowd they do not care to listen.
