L, CRT? How about this!, Koch Ebola, 2021-07-06, What the Hell is “The Seven Mountains Mandate?”  6/27/21 ©Scientific Morality  Last week it was “Cancel Culture.”  This week it’s “Critical Race Theory.”  Who knows what next week will bring?  (Sarcasm 101.) I am sure that the anthropomorphic God is sitting on his sacred throne watching his followers scream at school board members and remarking:  What warriors I have!  When they finally arrive here in Heaven I will give them an extra scoop of Ice Cream!  Ah...I forget.  After you die you don’t have taste buds.  (Sarcasm202.)   Like I said before if you believe in Christianity you will believe any supernatural hogwash.  That is the why the QAnon prank is working so well.  When it comes to Right wing conspiracies you don’t need verification just faith. Those of you who were old enough during the late 50’s or early 60’sremember the “Red Scare.”  There wasn’t any push back then because anyone who argued the point was deemed an UnAmerican Pinko. Many lost their jobs because of the Right wing’s “Black List. ”Some were in such a disconsolate state that they committed suicide. But hey!  The USA was spared from the “Red Menace!” Well guess what folks!  The ghost of Senator Joe McCarthy is now sitting in the pews of the Evangelical Church.  Those folks are claiming that “Critical Race Theory”—a university law course—is a Communist plot.  Floriduh Governor Ron De Santis has signed a bill that will indoctrinate kids on anti-Communism.   Yeah man!  I’m sure the Baby Boomer Cubans will be trilled about that program! It’s okay to say “You’d better not be a commie or you will be shot.” However it’s not okay to say “You’d better be a commie or you will be shot!” No immoral equivalence there! Yes there are National Islamic theocracies but do we need a Christian nation too?   Israel may be a Jewish State but I think it is more democratic that Iran.  Plus they have secular laws that aren’t based on the Bible.   Well now that they’ve exposed the evil Critical Race Theory let us expose the Judeo Christian plot:    The machination of the Fundamentalist Evangelical plan to overthrow the government and establish a Theocratic White Corporate Patriarchal State—in other words a “Fascist State.” So what is “The Seven Mountains Mandate?” I’ll tell ya Boobies! “Mountain” is a metaphor for struggling—like a mountain climber’s struggle to “conquer” a mountain by reaching its summit.  In this subject’s scenario God will run the country until all “seven mountains” are captured.  Read on:  1) Education: Public education is the target of the religious Right.  They want to burn all the history books and replace them with King James Bibles. They want to stop teaching science and thus turn public schools into parochial schools military schools and private schools. 2) Religion: All other religions will be eliminated and replaced by one Christian denomination. 3) Family: All families will be structured by the Christian state. 4) Business: All capitalist private businesses will be regulated by the state.  No porn or pot will be sold. 5) Government /Military: The U.S.  Army will change it’s name to “Christian Soldiers.” The Government will be controlled by God.  No legislation will occur unless a Senator and Congress member has a vision from God. 6) Arts/Entertainment: All art must be God-centered. 7) Media: All media content will be controlled by God and the State.  Ifyou don’t believe what I am saying Google: “The Seven Mountain Mandate.”  If you think Castro’s Cuba is bad or that Iran is terrible just wait until the Right wing Christians take over.https://youtu.be/gCGMXTJ9V_0
