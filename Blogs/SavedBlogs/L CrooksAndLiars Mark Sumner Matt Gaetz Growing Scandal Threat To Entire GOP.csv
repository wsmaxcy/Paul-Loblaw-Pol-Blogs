L, Matt Gaetz Growing Scandal Threat To Entire GOP, Mark Sumner, 04-04-21, The prospect of Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz being hoisted by his own “family values” petard is  certainly enticing. And when that scandal comes complete with ABC News reporting  that Gaetz was a member of a “group of young male lawmakers” who turned  scoring sex with “interns staffers or other female colleagues” into a  game and The New York Times is  reporting that Gaetz continued soliciting women for paid sex well after  he announced his engagement all the elements are certainly there for  for an atomic wedgie level of hoist.    However the growing scandal around Gaetz is not something that took  place in a vacuum. In addition to Gaetz and Florida Republican Joel  Greenberg there’s at least one other unnamed Republican official  involved in this sex trafficking ring. More importantly there are a lot  more unnamed people involved—like the women who Gaetz Greenberg and  associates paid to travel across states for the purposes of having sex.  At least one of these women was reportedly under the age of 18.  There may be more.   As the story expands so does the possibility that Gaetz was involved  in repeated acts that were both more serious and more extensive than  early reporting suggested. That includes new information that indicates  that Gaetz may have been directly involved in providing false IDs to the  underage targets of his sex trafficking organization.          New reporting from The Daily Beast shows  that the relationship between Gaetz and Greenberg extended beyond the  2019-2020 time frame originally reported elsewhere. That’s because a tip  to the FBI shows Gaetz accompanied Greenberg on a late-night trip to  his office in 2018 that triggered a security alarm. As it turns out the  FBI was already investigating Greenberg for something he was doing in  that office: making fake IDs.   Gaetz has denied having sex with a 17-year-old  calling it “verifiably false.” However the connection to an operation  generating fake IDs certainly extends the possibility that not only  did Gaetz knowingly recruit underaged girls for sex but that this might  not be a one-time incident.    Compounding this possibility is one of the strangest factors in an already very strange story: Matt Gaetz’s 19-year-old “son.”   In June of 2020 Gaetz posted a bizarre tweet introducing  19-year-old Nestor Galban as “my son” who lived with him. “As you can  imagine I was triggered when (to make an absurd debate point) a fellow  congressman diminished the contributions of Republicans because we don’t  raise non-white kids” Gaetz wrote. “Well I have."  Gaetz told People Magazine that  he had informally adopted Cuban-born Nestor Galban when the boy was 12  and Gaetz then a Florida state legislator was dating Nestor’s older  sister. After the relationship with the sister ended the then  13-year-old Galban moved in with Gaetz. Galban’s biological father lives  in Miami and Galban appears to have lived with his father for some of  the time Gaetz says he was “raising” his “son.” However Galban  reportedly graduated high school in 2020 meaning that the time that  Galban was in high school overlapped with the period in which Gaetz was  not only under investigation for soliciting sex from underage girls but  connected to Greenberg’s fake ID operation.  That at the very least raises concerns  that Gaetz’s connection to Galban might have been less about  parenting and more about access. Having a teenage boy in the home  certainly might serve as both a conduit and an excuse for why there  might also be teenage girls.  Greenberg is now facing an astonishing 33-count indictment. According to the South Florida Sun Sentinel those charges include bribery theft stalking a political opponent using a state database to create fake IDs and sex-trafficking involving a minor. The Washington Post  reported on Wednesday that Greenberg “flaunted his close ties” to  Gaetz Donald Trump and Roger Stone. Stone also made an appearance in  the Sun Sentinel this week claiming that Gaetz was the victim of “a smear.”  But there may be very good reasons that the recently pardoned Stone is anxious to see this scandal go away. So let me get this straight. Joel Greenberg being investigated for sex trafficking that's his friend Matt Gaetz back there and Roger Stone is sweating his role in Jan 6. You can smell the fear. In happier times pic.twitter.com/zbUubppLkt — Sandi Bachom (@sandibachom) March 31 2021 Gaetz’s mention of Greenberg as a “Second Amendment champion” comes because Greenberg insisted that his deputy tax collectors wear guns at  the office. Greenberg also used his own gun and his state ID as a tax  collector to stop a car under the pretense of being the police.   This is scandal that started out ugly and is getting worse by the  hour. The long-standing connection to Greenberg and the late-night  office visit suggests that Gaetz was aware of if not involved in the  scheme to create fake IDs. Multiple sources have reported that Gaetz is  under investigation for paying for minors to engage in interstate travel  for the purposes of sex. That “game” that Gaetz was reportedly playing  with other Republican congressmen involved “extra points” for sleeping  with virgins. And at the same time all this was happening Gaetz had a  teenage boy living at his home despite that boy having a father and  other relatives in the area.    Gaetz may be innocent. He relationship with Galban may be innocent. But at the moment all of this looks extremely bad.   It’s far from over. On Friday morning Gaetz’s communications director resigned “out of principal.” And CNN’s  Dana Bash says she’s being flooded with messages from those who have  worked with Gaetz. “If you could see my text messages from some of his  current and former colleagues” said Bash. “I actually can’t repeat what  some of them say on morning television.”   There’s also this bit of reporting from Florida Trend  that dates back to Gaetz’s time in the Florida House. That was when the  state attempted to pass a bill against revenge porn that ended up being  so watered down that it would ultimately prove useless in defending  women. The bill got that way because “one of the chief opponents of the  legislation was Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fort Walton Beach).” Even after  succeeding in getting the bill gutted Gaetz was one of just two  legislators who voted against it. That’s especially damning history as CNN  reported on Thursday evening that Gaetz allegedly sent other lawmakers  “photos and videos of nude women he said he had slept with.”   That wasn’t just Florida legislators then. It was Washington D.C. legislators today.  Matt Gaetz has been walking around Congress showing off nude videos of  women he claims to have slept with to his fellow Republicans all while  continuing his tirades about “family values.” And none of them not one  called him out on it.   What may be the most disturbing thing about Gaetz’s reported actions  is his own sense that he was apparently untouchable. According to  sources at ABC and The New York Times Gaetz kept up his  recruitment and pay of women well after Greenberg had been arrested and  even after Gaetz had announced his engagement.    What may be most disturbing about everyone else is that they’re just  coming forward with their statements about Gaetz now even though  they’ve known exactly what he is for years. This is a scandal with  boundaries that are still growing. And it’s not going to stop with  Gaetz. Posted with permission from Daily Kos.
