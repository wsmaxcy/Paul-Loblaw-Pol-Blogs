L, Stoners of the World Unite - Good News Roundup Bluesday April 20th 2021, NotNowNotEverforGood News, 2021-04-20, Back in 1971 a group of high school kids in San Rafael California used to meet every afternoon at 4:20PM next to a statue of Louis Pasteur to get high.  They called their meeting the “4:20 Louis.”  That shortly morphed into using four-twenty as a general code for getting baked.  Being stoners the relationship between hours/minutes and months/days is mostly immaterial.  That’s how we ended up with a daily meeting becoming a yearly occasion. The serendipitous aspect of this is that stoners are helping to rehabilitate an otherwise notorious day.  When my mother was about to bring my brother into the world she held off until after 4/20 so my brother wouldn’t share a birthday with infamy. But stoners and my mom aside this is a day celebrated throughout the entire Reichwing as a day of yearning.  This is when they dream of turning the clock back to when they could kill their political opponents scapegoats and straw-men with impunity and wild abandon [Somehow they have collective amnesia about the karmic force visited on their last fascist paradise]. Today their chief mystics (Lindell Taylor-Greene Jordan Carlson Cruz et al) will cavort about the country festooned with the traditional chickenhawk entrails while yammering ceaselessly about their heroes (Former Guy & the Failed House Painter) both having the same number of letters (11) in their names. Back in the day Keith Olbermann used to close out his program with a segment called The Worst Person in the World (Bill O’Reilly was a frequent winner).  If he produced that segment today he’d have to call it The Worst People in the World and focus it exclusively on the republican brainless trust.  Whether you call them Putin’s Pedophiles or the RNC doesn’t make much difference.  They are collectively responsible for more cruelty pain and suffering in the United States than all other causes combined.  They have blessed us with bad wars bad science bad medicine bad faith and bad hair.  They are champions of racism misogyny homophobia inequality inequity and halitosis. It is long past time to brush them from the world stage and get back to making the world a better place for everyone.  Please stay involved and committed to our shared future.  We are counting on each other. Up the Resistance In honor of this being National Poetry Month and our brand new tradition of starting off roundups with an inspirational poem here’s something topical from John Oliver:  There’s some news to share. Opening Up the Correct Way (There’s Nothing Rightwing About It) He gets a vaccine.  She gets a vaccine.  Everybody gets a vaccine!  In other news the entire vaccine averse republican party has qualified for the largest group Darwin award in history. ABC News:  All US adults now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines All adults in the United States are eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting Monday with all 50 states and Washington D.C. meeting the April 19 deadline President Joe Biden had set for opening eligibility. Hawaii Massachusetts New Jersey Rhode Island and Vermont were the last states to open eligibility to everyone age 16 and older on Monday. The April 19 deadline had been moved up from the May 1 goal Biden initially set for all adults to qualify for vaccination. … In the meantime half of adults in the United States have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 33% of adults are fully vaccinated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Goodbye Walter “WELL MY TIME HAS COME.” Here’s the email Walter Mondale sent 300+ staffers and associates over the weekend. He noted how he looked forward to seeing his late wife Joan and late daughter Eleanor. “Never has a public servant had a better group of people working at their side!” pic.twitter.com/bIRLBpSZde  Methinks They Dost Protest Too Much The Reichwing standard bearers of Conservative American Regressive Policies are complaining they just can’t catch a break.  That’s just too damn bad (and also appropriate). Wonkette:  OAN Employees Real Sorry About Poisoning Your Nana's Brain Please Stop Calling Them 'Nazis' Now? "We're not Nazis" a One America News producer told the New York Times. "Just like everyday people." Because if you think about it the real victims here are the poor OAN staffers cruelly misjudged when they're just following orders. In this case those orders come from the network fuhrer himself Charles Herring the owner of OAN who insists his employees scrape up all the sticky bits from floors of wingnut chat rooms and call it "news."   Times reporter Rachel Abrams writes Assignments that the elder Mr. Herring takes a special interest in are known among OAN staff as "H stories" several current and former employees said. The day after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Mr. Herring instructed OAN employees in an email which The New York Times reviewed to "report all the things Antifa did yesterday. That would be a short report since Antifa did nothing on January 6 when Trump's maniac supporters were sacking the seat of government.   Gym Jordan Is Good at Getting Ratioed  If I was even 10% as stupid as Gym Jordan I’d listen to Auntie Maxine and keep my mouth shut. Huffington Post:  Jim Jordan Asked A Snarky Question About Masks And Twitter Users Did Not Hold Back Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) received a series of stinging rebukes for his latest attempt at politicizing coronavirus pandemic public health precautions. “How many masks are we supposed to wear this week?” Jordan a Donald Trump sycophant snarkily asked on Twitter Monday. Many critics reminded Jordan of the guidance ― and of the 567000 Americans who have died from COVID-19: Enough so that no one can hear you whining. https://t.co/fksz90NCDR  Some Background on How We Got Here The Teabaggers have much to atone for.  This is an in depth look inside the cesspit’s history. Mother Jones:  How a Feud Between Two Tea Party Leaders Helped Lay the Groundwork for the Capitol Insurrection — Stephanie Mengimer “Hello deplorables!” That’s how Amy Kremer greeted the thousands of Trump supporters she had helped gather at the Ellipse in Washington DC on January 6 to “stop the steal.” Resplendent onstage in a bold leopard-print shawl with the White House rising up behind her the former flight attendant had come a long way since she and another Georgia woman Jenny Beth Martin became known as the “founding mothers” of the tea party movement back in 2009. During the heyday of the grassroots conservative movement that had sprung up to oppose President Barack Obama Kremer had headlined cross-country bus tours stumping for candidates like Christine (“I’m not a witch”) O’Donnell and fighting against the Affordable Care Act. The tea party had helped elect hardcore conservatives who blew up immigration reform and took down former Republican House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) for insufficient conservatism. But six months into the life of the movement the two women split up and this was before a bitter legal dispute—over tactics and money and salacious rumors—that lasted for years. As the Republican Party absorbed and institutionalized their movement Martin successfully embedded in the Washington GOP establishment while Kremer kept trying to recapture the outsider energy of those early glory days. Put This in Your Pipe and Smoke It In honor of 4/20 Day (the good one) here’s some news about just how mainstream pot has become.  Oh my how the times have changed. Vox:  Stoners just don’t need this much stuff — Beca Grimm Stoners have long had the reputation for ingenuity. We’ve honed the ability to turn almost any object into a smoking device (see the iconic apple-as-pipe here in ceramic form) and are well-versed in using common items like straightened-out bobby pins to clear the bowl in said pipe or a mortar and pestle to break up sticky icky before grinders became widely available. Rolling joints in Bible pages — although not recommended — became a trope because it became so common. Smoking was illicit and solutions were homemade. For a long time marijuana enthusiasts weren’t a desirable market and we got by. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when cannabis and the people who smoke it became so mainstream. Maybe it was when Colorado and Washington legalized weed in 2016 or maybe it happened even earlier in 2008 when the queen of commercial clean Martha Stewart publicly befriended Snoop Dogg a rapper and weed business bro considered reefer royalty. By 2018 you could cop artisanal hemp kombucha from your city’s bougiest bodega as well as tincture for CBD (a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found naturally in the plant credited with aiding everything from body pains to insomnia) from the local 7-11. Marketers and anyone else looking to cash in on the green rush saw the writing on the wall and by spring 2021 there isn’t an everyday product or service you can think of that doesn’t have a stoner-specific iteration available for purchase — like $58 Herbivore Emerald CBD + Adaptogens Deep Moisture Glow Oil rolling papers that shake out to ~$7/pop (quite the gamble if you’re not the most prolific roller) a sativa seed hydrating face mask going for $24 each a spacy-yet-posh $2000 24-karat gold ashtray or a $450 Edie Parker Table Top Lighter with its weighty emerald marble base and sterling silver functionalities. You can spend as much or as little as you want on cannabis-related and -tangential products. Your Dose of The Borowitz Vaccine Maybe they should bar people who a clinically brain-dead from Congress.  This is just too easy. The New Yorker:  Satire from the Borowitz Report:  Marjorie Taylor Greene Calls for the Development of Anglo-Saxon Space Lasers WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene a leading member of the new America First caucus is calling for the development of what she called “Anglo-Saxon space lasers.” “Anglo-Saxons have for too long ceded space-laser superiority to the airborne laser beams of foreign banking élites” she said. “This shall not stand on my watch.” And You Thought It Was All About Covid-19 If this keeps up (remember the cancer vaccines in the pipeline) it will be hard to tell the difference between humans and pincushions (unless we’re talking about republican deadenders who would rather die than admit to being wrong). GoodNewsNetwork:  First Human Trial of HIV Vaccine Produced Immune Response in 97% of Volunteers A phase 1 clinical trial of an experimental vaccine primed the immune system using a unique approach in order to prevent HIV. The promising results announced in February by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and Scripps Research the vaccine showed success in stimulating production of rare immune cells needed to generate antibodies against the fast-mutating virus—and the targeted response was detected in 97 percent of participants who received the vaccine. “We showed that vaccines can be designed to stimulate rare immune cells with specific properties and this targeted stimulation can be very efficient in humans” said William Schief PhD a professor and immunologist at Scripps Research and executive director of vaccine design at IAVI’s Neutralizing Antibody Center whose lab developed the vaccine. I had a lot of trouble narrowing it down to just one song.  So I didn’t.  Our resident history professor’s always interesting history lesson will appear here as soon as I notice he’s posted it in the comment section.  Until then look for it in the comment section.          Lest you think it started with Boebert Greene Cruz & Gaetz The lunatic fringe wags the underdog. — H.L. Mencken Feminism is a socialist anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians. — Pat Robertson Christians like slaves and soldiers ask no questions. — Jerry Falwell Juarez is reported to be the most dangerous city in America. — Rick Perry I will tell you that I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa Florida after the debate. She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine that injection and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. — Michelle Bachman I feel the best way to ensure Americans' freedom is to tighten restrictions on that freedom in any way possible. Only through wiretaps illegal searches and seizures unfettered government intrusion a controlled media and a complete crackdown on free speech can we ensure the liberties of all people. — John Ashcroft  and the list goes on and on and on and on and on and on ... We all know I’m the more tailented writer here at the NNNE Institute.  That’s why I’ve decided to chase my tale-telling opportunities.  I’ve been working to get NNNE to sit up and beg for my help and he’s finally learned the trick.  In my bi-weekly Pressley’s Picks I plan to bring you video treats I’ve devoured and enjoyed.  I sniff them out all over the web.  Enjoy. Us dogs are way more diverse than you guys.  Check out my cousin.  Sometimes you guys are really cruel.  This really raises my hackles: Thanks for slogging on through to the end of another Roundup.  Remember to stay active and involved while also looking out for your health.  We need you! hpg keeps on keeping on.  Last night’s Evening Shade:  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN---Day89---Evening Shade-Monday Dylan wrote it.  Hendrix made it his own.  And the Dead took it into Space.  Today we’ll close out the festivities with an absolutely fierce version of All Along the Watchtower from 1993 —  “There must be someway out of here / said the joker to the thief / There’s too much confusion / And I can’t get no relief.”  Disclaimer:  Matt Gaetz is still a giant useless asshat.
