L, Anti-Masker Gets A Month In Jail For Coughing In The Face Of Shoppers, Ed Scarce, 04-10-21, Debra Jo Hunter wept as the judge ignored her plea agreement and gave her jail time instead. A viral video of the shopper at a Pier 1 in St. Johns Town Center who grew irate when she was told to wear a mask cost this woman her freedom. As the situation in the store escalated after some time she finally went up to another woman recording her and coughed in her face before leaving the store. That woman was a cancer patient posting on Facebook at the time that she went directly for a COVID test. Hunter had pled guilty two weeks ago finally realizing she could get jail time and she did. At her sentencing hearing Judge James Ruth gave her 29 days in jail for her tirade instead of probation with conditions. If only more of these 'Karens' got the same.

But after they spoke on behalf of Hunter Sprague told the judge about the confrontation that happened only months after she underwent brain tumor surgery.  Sprague said she watched Hunter 53 give at least 15 minutes of what she called "escalating bullying" swearing and threats to Pier 1 staff about a broken item with Sprague's children nearby. It was only when Sprague said she started shooting video in the final minute of the tirade that she was yelled at then coughed on. Here's a news report from two weeks ago when she pled guilty.
