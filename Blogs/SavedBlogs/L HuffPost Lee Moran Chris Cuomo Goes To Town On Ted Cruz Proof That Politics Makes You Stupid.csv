L, Chris Cuomo Goes To Town On Ted Cruz: 'Proof That Politics Makes You Stupid', Lee Moran, 2021-05-12, CNN’s Chris Cuomo on Tuesday tore into Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) description of the For the People Act a Democratic-backed package of voting rights and ethics reforms as “Jim Crow 2.0.” The “Cuomo Prime Time” anchor explained how the proposal to expand voting rights which passed the House in March seeks to counter voter suppression measures being imposed in Republican-led states in response to ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims of voting fraud. “These are not about color these laws” Cuomo said. “Just like Jim Crow. They weren’t explicitly about color. They were color-neutral. But class catches you just the same.”  “And you guys white and Black are going to be on long lines. Long lines with fewer people and less time to exercise your right to fight for anything better in your life” he continued. “You’re going to be put in the back of the line again.” Rep. Liz Cheney gave a simple statement of reality tonight says @ChrisCuomo of the embattled Republican’s defiant floor speech. “Trump lost. And the big lie is just that a lie.”“When leaders refuse to stand for anything all those whom they lead will fall for anything.” pic.twitter.com/Wy9g0vLggg Cuomo then addressed Cruz’s comment which the Texas Republican made earlier Tuesday during a Senate Rules Committee debate on the For the People legislation. “This man is proof that politics makes you stupid” Cuomo said of Cruz who backed Trump’s attempts at overturning the 2020 election result. “This is a debate champion Ivy League twice over” Cuomo said. “And that is one of the stupidest arguments I can imagine. He’s right they were Democrats (who passed the Jim Crow laws). You know what they also were? Bigots. That’s what they were.” Cuomo said Cruz “owns that mantle” of being a bigot “because he stands for laws that are nothing but discriminatory based on class face and place.” “Jim Crow laws were aimed at making it nearly impossible for Black Americans to vote without ever mentioning color” he added. “The remedy is sitting in the House and the Senate the For the People Act.” Cuomo’s late father Mario Cuomo served as New York governor from 1983 to 1994. The CNN anchor’s brother Andrew Cuomo has been the New York governor since 2011. In recent months the journalist’s sibling has faced a slew of sexual misconduct allegations and criticism for concealing deaths at nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic.
