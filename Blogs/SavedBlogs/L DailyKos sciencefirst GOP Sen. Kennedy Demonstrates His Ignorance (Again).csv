L, GOP Sen. Kennedy Demonstrates His Ignorance (Again), sciencefirst, 2021-04-21, The gentleman from Louisiana would like to compare U.S. police to the world’s Islamic communities. His comment demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of the differences between the two. He speaks as if all Muslim people carry guns and are empowered to take lives. Moreover his mention of “hate” reveals that it is likely that he hates Islam. "One other quick point when a radical Muslim jihadist blows up a school were always told don't judge all people of the Muslim faith by the acts of a few and I agree with that. How come the same rule doesn't apply to police officers? And that's why I said if you hate cops just because they are cops I'm not defending bad policing but if you hate cops is because they are cops then you're wrong and next time you get in trouble just call a crackhead and see how that works out for you." Murders performed by jihadists are always illegal wherever they occur; whereas most deaths caused by police in the U.S.A. are shielded from scrutiny.   Most of us who are critical of our police forces do not hate the police but we would like to end the extra-judicial murders funded by our tax dollars. Human life should not be taken over such minor things as cigarette tax stamps counterfeit bills or simply being afraid.
