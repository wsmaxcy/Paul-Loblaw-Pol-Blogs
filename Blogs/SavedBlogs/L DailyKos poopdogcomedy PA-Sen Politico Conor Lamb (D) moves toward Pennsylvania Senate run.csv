L, PA-Sen: Politico "Conor Lamb (D) moves toward Pennsylvania Senate run", poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-30, From Politico: Rep. Conor Lamb has begun telling some donors and supporters in recent days that he is likely to enter the Pennsylvania Senate race according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. Lamb has urged some donors to contribute quickly as he ramps up his fundraising operation ahead of a formal launch. The timeline for an announcement was not clear and one source familiar with the Democrat's thinking says there are no imminent plans to enter the race. Lamb a former Marine and federal prosecutor who won a critical special election in 2018 has said he is seriously considering a run to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. He has been tight-lipped about his thinking though his team has hired fundraising consultants and recently held a high-profile fundraiser with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). But these conversations represent one of the clearest signs that he is taking concrete steps towards running. In a statement to POLITICO campaign manager Abby Nassif-Murphy acknowledged that Lamb was eyeing the Senate race but said “no decision has been made.” It’s an indication that the Pennsylvania GOP is setting their sights on getting rid of his district. Plus we might see round two of Lamb versus this wannabe Sedition Caucus douche bag: Sean Parnell a decorated combat veteran and favorite of former President Donald Trump is all but certain to run for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania according to a Republican official who spoke with Parnell this week. “He said he was 99% sure this is what he was going to do” said Sam DeMarco the Republican chairman in Allegheny County where Parnell came up just short in a high-profile bid for Congress last year. “If he does make that decision he’s going to be a formidable candidate.” Parnell has begun calling top GOP officials in Pennsylvania to discuss a potential 2022 Senate run and plans to contact all 67 Republican county chairs according to a person close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. “Sean is increasingly concerned [about] the direction this country is going since Joe Biden became president” a Parnell spokesperson said. “He is currently speaking with people throughout the state on how he can best stand up for the people of Pennsylvania against the job-killing agenda of this White House.” If he joins the race Parnell — who was part of an effort to throw out more than 2.5 million lawful mail votes and overturn the result of Pennsylvania’s presidential election — may have at least some support from Trump’s inner circle if not from the former president himself. Personally I support Lt. Governor John Fetterman’s (D. PA) U.S. Senate bid but I can also see Lamb being a strong candidate as well since he’s a perfect fit for the state. We shall see but it’s getting more and more clear that the Pennsylvania Senate election is gaining steam. In the mean time let’s keep up the momentum to flip this seat and expand our Senate Majority.
