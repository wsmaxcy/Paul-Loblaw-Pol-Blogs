L, Why are all colleges not mandating that students get the vaccine?, phatrat82, 2021-04-22, I heard on the radio that many colleges are not mandating that their students get vaccinated. Which is crazy! How can institutions of higher learning not believe in this basic science? College students are the best spreaders of COVID. Colleges usually mandate that incoming students have MMR and Tetanus vaccines why not require this too?!? It’s a public health concern and I realize that because of our system stupid people can’t be forced to vaccinate but if you are going to be coming in contact with others and there’s a system already in place requiring some vaccinations just tack this on…  That’s all I got.
