L, Musings for Friday - After 100 Days We're All Sleeping Better Because Adults. But Still On Guard, TexDem, 2021-04-30, Markos’ post yesterday notes the positives surrounding having Joe Biden as POTUS. But with the former guy and the GQP we can’t fully relax. It’s clear to every sane individual paying attention that the former guy and the GQP can’t win in a straight up manner. As a party they completely abandoned their principals and any ideals they may have had even though we didn’t agree with those. Now their only goals are to retain power wherever they still have it and by any means necessary regain it on the national level.  What I find most amazing is how little they are being excoriated daily in every newspaper in the land. The most of the media really think their job is to be 3rd party observers delivering the news from a sterile nonpartisan perspective. They fail to recognize that their job is to fully inform not just inform. Treating every issue as a both sides issue is doing a disservice to journalism their readers and their country. If one side is full of shit it’s their job to call them out and not give credence to every cry of foul by the former guy the Ted Cruzes and the Ron Johnsons.    There are some things many of us are still impatient for results. The Courts and De Joy are two. But we have to acknowledge that the former guy along with McConnell hampered the incoming administration. The former guy by not cooperating with the transition of power. McConnell by letting his Senate Chairs delay Biden filling his Cabinet until after the Inauguration. We’re 6-8 weeks behind in many areas. Considering these handicaps the Biden Team has done an outstanding job. Chuck Schumer? Not so much. Chuck wants to take a bow for just doing his job. Guess what Chuck? Quit taking bows. You’re not doing your job. Who’s the Senate Majority Leader anyway? You or Joe Manchin? If you keep letting Manchin dictate things you’re going to be Senate Minority Leader and you will have fucked over the entire country.    That said outside of our personal lives I think we’re all sleeping better because of the adults heading the government. Sleep well everybody!  At least for now.
