L, I've got whiplash from the last week..., FuzzyTheBotbuilder, 2021-04-21, Wow. Just wow.I went from a crotchety old bastard of a bachelor hermit back to pretending to be an upstanding parental figure of a 13 year old child all in the space of 3 days. My grandson just moved in with me and I am in the process of getting full guardianship. He’s stayed with me before and I’ve had guardianship of him before ending about 5 years ago.  I didn’t know he was coming. I hadn’t even talked to my daughter in 6 months after refusing to financially back an incredibly sketchy and shady AF money making scheme she was hawking. She just dropped him off at my apartment without so much as a Hi Bye or kiss my a**.  He was in possession of 3 t-shirts 3 pairs of pants 2 pairs of shoes some underwear that’s too small a rather ratty looking coat a tear-stained face and a huge case of panic anxiety and total stress. I just happened to pull in as she pulled out.  Since Sunday I’ve filed for emergency guardianship transitioning to permanent talked to DCS to put a bug in the judge’s ear to hurry up signed him up for school spent a couple hundred dollars just for basics for him and sat up till 2 a.m. two nights in a row just listening to him vent. Since he left for school this morning I’ve been crying non-stop. This poor child has been through absolute hell. Both verbal and physical abuse 2 evictions and just a general whipping boy for her frustrations. I’m pissed beyond words and I’m heartbroken. But I’m also hopeful and purposeful now.I’m getting my boy back a piece at a time. This kid is an artist in every sense of the word. He’s f*cking amazing. I bought him an inexpensive sketchbook and the mechanical pencils he likes too and he’s just going to town. I’m totally floored by how much his skills has improved and evolved just since I saw him 6 months ago. I would go out and spend a grand on art supplies for him if I had it because he’s healing himself through his art.  He still needs a lot of stuff like a laptop for school more clothes some kind of dedicated study area (looking at ikea when I get my next check) and just the things a 13 year old boy needs like a bicycle some appropriate toys etc. I’m gonna have to scrape and do without myself for a little bit and it’s gonna be hard on just my disability but I’m positive I can pull this off. He’s worth it and a hell of a lot more to me. Hm. I’m positive. I haven’t felt positive in way too long.  Even through all this I think my life just got a hell of a lot better too. I love this little boy with all my heart and I’m going to be so proud of him no matter what just because he’s him. I just want to let people know I’m not asking for help. I have lots of family and I’m pretty industrious. Only thing I ask is encouragement and advice. If people REALLY want to help I’ll put together an amazon wish list for what he needs but I’m not going to accept cash donations. Too many people are hurting a lot worse than I am and I don’t want to feel guilty by taking away when I’m in a relatively safe and stable situation.
