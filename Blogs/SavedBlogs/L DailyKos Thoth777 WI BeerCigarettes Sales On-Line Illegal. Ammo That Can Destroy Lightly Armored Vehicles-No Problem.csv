L, WI Beer/Cigarettes Sales On-Line Illegal. Ammo That Can Destroy Lightly Armored Vehicle's-No Problem, Thoth777, 2021-04-25, If you thought regulations on guns are lax-ammunition is even worse. The largest rounds of ammunition legally available to civilians in the United States are 50-caliber bullets. The Browning machine gun invented in the early 20th century used a 50-caliber shot. (2)  Colonel Norman A. Chandler a retired Marine sniper expert said of the 50-caliber power "Imagine a pair of marines with an infantry rifle that at 2000 yards or more could simply and systematically wipe out an entire airfield or truck park or radar installation." (3) 50-caliber shells are subject to the lowest level of federal regulations because they are considered rifle ammunition.  Federal law has no age restriction on rifle ammunition. (4) In Wisconsin beer and cigarettes internet sales over state lines are illegal. Ammunition purchases are not. Because ammunition purchases do not have background checks or records kept on sales weak Wisconsin ammunition law is irrelevant no matter the quantity purchased or by whom.  Luckygunner.com can ship ammunition to any Wisconsin residents who claim they comply with Luckygunners terms. Adding insult to injury you will have to pay an extra fee of $6.35 if you wish to have an adult sign for the ammunition when it arrives. The gun and ammunition industry continues to innovate and develop new products to increase profits.  Innovation in the ammunition industry usually involves increasing lethality-what the industry refers to as "stopping power." Hollowpoint bullets are an example of this "innovation." Dr. Leana Wen an emergency physician described the impact this bullet has on a human body this way "Once they enter the body they fragment and explode pulverizing bones tearing blood vessels and liquefying organs." Some of the deadliest massacres in the United States used hollow point ammunition. Examples of new ammunition developed with no federal oversight over marketing or sale include (4): Very few states have laws on this type of ammunition. The Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre in 2012 killed twenty children between the ages of six and seven and six staff members. No meaningful gun reform has happened since then. Untold lives lost by gun violence and suicide lifetimes in wheelchairs useless arms and colostomies continue year after year after year. Sandy Hook proves many of our current politicians will not change. It is up to the us-the voter to change the politicians or the status-quo of "thoughts and prayers" will continue as the solution to gun violence.
