L, I got my first dose of the vaccine, Alonso del Arte, 2021-04-27, Last week I got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I’m tentatively scheduled for the second dose at the appropriate time in a couple of weeks. I suppose I could have gotten it sooner. Eligibility was opened to my age group here in Michigan about a couple of weeks before the federal requirement. At first I tried to get the vaccine at Ford Field the same place Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-Michigan) got her first shot. It seems that you have to go through Meijer for that. I went to the website read the disclosures filled out the form and then nothing. A few days later I got a text message telling me to fill out a questionnaire online and that the link was only valid for 24 hours. That was more like 24 minutes. By the time I got around to it the link simply redirected to the Meijer homepage. I tried again. I have yet to hear anything more from Meijer. Then I decided to call (313) 230-0505. After listening to a pre-recorded message and being on hold for a few seconds I talked to a human being answered some basic questions and was given an appointment to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for the following week. That phone number is for people who live or work in Detroit. If I hadn’t gotten an appointment that way my next step might have been to go to the CDC website specifically the Vaccine Finder page. My Johnson & Johnson appointment was scheduled right before the six or seven cases of clotting prompted the CDC to call for a pause of Johnson & Johnson to review the data and decide what to do next. It looked like a one-in-a-million chance but it was enough for the medical experts in Michigan to decide to switch upcoming appointments to Pfizer. I got a text message telling me that I had been switched over and that I was tentatively scheduled for a second shot three weeks after my first shot. I wasn’t particularly concerned. One-in-a-million probably works out to my chance of winning any prize greater than $5 in a lottery and the most I’ve ever won is $2. As is often said I have a better chance of being struck by lightning. Though to be fair I’m not trying to get struck by lightning and I haven’t played the lottery in years. So I figure that my chance of getting coronavirus if I’m not vaccinated is medium to high and my chance of suffering a vaccine complication is extremely slow. Trading a high risk for a low risk seems like an easy choice to me. I had an afternoon appointment. The morning on the day of I got a call asking if I could come in right at that very moment. I think I had already had breakfast but it was just too inconvenient for me to go at that very moment. Isn’t being able to go at an agreed-upon time supposed to be the whole point of having an appointment? But I was also worried that they were going to run out since they were also taking walk-ins so I did go about an hour and a half before my appointment. There was this dumb little brat hanging around near the site. “Maybe you should do your own research” the dumbass said to me. “You can’t sue for ten years. It’s pretty suss.” So I can sue after ten years? Clearly I wasn’t talking to a sharp legal mind. I brushed him off and moved on. Just outside the building the volunteers had me fill out a form and read an information sheet. Once I did that I was directed into the building. I didn’t have to wait long. A nurse reviewed my paperwork told me to roll up my sleeve as she prepared the syringe. It was at that precise moment that the good people from Oil & Water Don’t Mix decided to give me a phone call. They’re still short of their $10000 goal for an ad to counter Enbridge’s lie-filled ad about their dangerous Line 5 that could destroy the Great Lakes. I told them I would call them back. The nurse was ready to give me my shot. The needle wasn’t painful it was just weird. I wondered if it was maybe because of how coldly the vaccine needs to be stored. The nurse put a bandage on me and told me to stay in the observation area for a quarter hour. And she gave me a card with the lot number for the vaccine I had just gotten EW01**. A bunch of folding chairs had been set up six feet apart and less than half of them were full. I wish the Oil & Water people had called at that moment I had a good fifteen minutes to devote to them. Instead I checked my messages and ordered pepperoni bread from a pizzeria for carryout. Once my fifteen minutes were up I checked in with the volunteers checking up on the outgoing patients and another nurse advised me to take a Motrin or a Tylenol preemptively. I did feel a pain in my armpit but it wasn’t serious enough for me to want to take any medicine for it. So I didn’t. I figured if I felt badly enough the next day I would take something. I’ve had some aches and a runny nose but I’d rather blame those on the change to Daylight Saving Time than on the vaccine. I assume that next week they will call me to schedule my second shot. But if they don’t I will follow up. First dose of a two-dose vaccine is better than nothing at all. I prefer to be fully vaccinated though. Some people upon getting the second shot might feel the urge to ditch the mask and go lick doorknobs as Stephen Colbert has joked. I think I’m going to keep wearing a mask for some time after getting my second shot unless I hear otherwise from Dr. Fauci or from Dr. Joneigh Khaldoun. I don’t like wearing a mask but I would definitely not like getting coronavirus. A couple of hours ago I got a text message from Meijer. I’m asked to fill out a questionnaire. It had a link something like rx dot meijer dot com slash tw slash P29 followed by a bunch of seemingly random letters and numbers. Supposedly this link is also valid for 24 hours. But this link like the previous one (P28) also just takes me to the Meijer home page. The Meijer questionnaire is said to be for a first shot of Moderna on April 26. I need a second shot of Pfizer but not this soon… Wait a minute April 26? That was Monday. I’m not worried for myself. I’m worried that stragglers might be discouraged by bureaucratic mix-ups like this one.
