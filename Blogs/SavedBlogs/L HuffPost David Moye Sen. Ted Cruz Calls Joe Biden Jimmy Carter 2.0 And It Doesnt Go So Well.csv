L, Sen. Ted Cruz Calls Joe Biden 'Jimmy Carter 2.0' And It Doesn't Go So Well, David Moye, 2021-07-02, Sen. Ted Cruz’s attempt to insult President Joe Biden by comparing him to Jimmy Carter didn’t go so well based on the response from Twitter users. The Texas Republican referred to Biden as “Jimmy Carter 2.0” on Fox News on Thursday claiming “the same sort of ideology and incompetence that characterized the Carter regime characterizes now the Biden-Harris regime.” Although a recent C-SPAN presidential survey ranks Carter as the No. 26 best president he is often considered one of the best post-presidents thanks to his work with Habitat for Humanity the Carter Center and his efforts to promote democracy human rights and global health. As a result many Twitter users were quick to criticize Cruz’s hackneyed attempt to throw red meat to his base. wow you mean like a decent human being? https://t.co/BDSo8nlPCj Ted Cruz is Benedict Arnold 2.0 https://t.co/SKglSc0PxS Ted Cruz is the Cowardly Lion 2.0. https://t.co/hCZmn0JYMz pic.twitter.com/PoZjUhySxj Says Kevin Malone 2.0(pssh he wishes) https://t.co/vjPaVGtVbS For what it's worth a recent @YouGov survey found that 58 percent of Americans have a positive opinion of Jimmy Carter.The senator's result in the same survey was...lower. https://t.co/ezuvEvq1lG pic.twitter.com/W47uMIofeH So he's like the guy who builds houses for poor people as opposed to the guy who builds gaudy apartments for rich people and was caught discriminating in his rentals against Black folks?Mmm-k but I think you need to work on your insults... https://t.co/heuv90FZwt Republicans have accused every Democratic president since Jimmy Carter of being another Carter. Telling that the president whose foreign policy they hate most is the one who said of his time in office: "We never went to war. We never dropped a bomb. We never fired a bullet." https://t.co/jx93Muv1ty Never thought I'd hear Ted Cruz endorse Joe Biden. https://t.co/nIo3tvaBUz Wow. Going back over 40 years for a reference that makes no sense. That makes @tedcruz Milliard Fillmore the new and improved version now with extra oats. https://t.co/Rezszbfdnx Jimmy Carter - 4 years as a middling president followed by 40+ years of famously being the most saintly ex-president in history.Ted Cruz is an idiot. https://t.co/hCZmn0JYMz Jimmy Carter:- Decent kind family man- Never impeached- Building homes for humanity well into his 90sTed Cruz:- Abandoned Texans for Cancun- Bows to guy who dissed his wifeDon't be a Ted Cruz.Be a Jimmy Carter. https://t.co/1JjA1FOydz
