L, Report on Mingus Part 1, ibar88, 2021-07-07, He’s been with us for 20 years 8 of them by himself after his brother Monk passed from cancer. He’s been such an important part of our lives our singular focus. When we order food we order with him in mind. Because he’s always right up there on the table looking for his share. Up until last week when he really couldn’t climb anymore. In 2020 he had a urinary blockage and then an infection in the anal gland and pulled through each time. But lately it’s clear he is starting to fade. He’s been dragging his back legs. His meows are weak. He has found a hiding place on the bottom shelf of the kitchen pantry where he sleeps most of the day and night. Sometimes you know when it’s time because the signs are obvious. Not quite as clear here. We had him at the ER vet yesterday who feels that his kidney disease is resurgent and that he now has advanced liver disease and neurological problems affecting the back legs. The ER vet didn’t push us one way or another but she was quite clear that there are only palliative measures available and they have their own problems. I suggested that we give him a couple of days more and then bring in someone in-home. The ER vet said she supported that decision. So in 26 hours the in-home vet will arrive to administer a cocktail of drugs and Mingus will be no more though his spirit — as with his brother Monk — will never leave us. More stories of him to come after it’s all done.  UPDATE 7-8: He rallied since the original post was put up enough so we don’t think he’s ready. He’s too alert too engaged to go. Plus our regular vet had us evaluate him according to a set of criteria she has for euthanasia and he’s above the threshold.  The fact is he’s 20.  He’s not going to make a miraculous return to kittenhood and the fact that he appears to have crashed twice in the last 10 days leads us to believe the end isn’t that far off.  But it’s not today and for that we continue to be glad. When I left him at home with my wife he was eating one of his favorite packets of food. This picture was taken in the last 6 hours.
