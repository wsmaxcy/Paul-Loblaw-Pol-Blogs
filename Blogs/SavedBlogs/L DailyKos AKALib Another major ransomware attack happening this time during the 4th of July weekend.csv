L, Another major ransomware attack happening this time during the 4th of July weekend, AKALib, 2021-07-02, The REvil cyber-criminals are at it again launching a major ransomware attack on organizations that use software from a major remote management solutions vendor encrypting files on their computers and demanding huge ransom amounts to decrypt and restore the files. The timing of the attack on this July 4th weekend follows a pattern where these attacks are launched during Friday evenings when there are fewer IT department staffers on duty. REvil ransomware hits 200 companies in massive MSP supply-chain attack - @LawrenceAbramshttps://t.co/3J94Vrsg80 Similar to Solarwinds the ransomware software was spread via a commonly used software system made by Kaseya a provider of remote management solutions which released a new software update on Friday. From doublepulsar.com/… - Kaseya VSA is a commonly used solution by MSPs — Managed Service Providers — in the United States and United Kingdom which helps them manage their client systems. Kaseya’s website claims they have over 40000 customers. Four hours ago an apparent auto update in the product has delivered REvil ransomware. By design it has administrator rights down to client systems — which means that Managed Service Providers who are infected then infect their client’s systems. Statement from Kaseya - We are in the process of investigating the root cause of the incident with an abundance of caution but we recommend that you IMMEDIATELY shutdown your VSA server until you receive further notice from us. Its critical that you do this immediately because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA. Given that the attackers used a software vendor as a vector rather than targeting individual organizations (this technique is known as a supply-chain attack) the extent to which this ransomware will spread is not immediately known not even to the attackers. How the attackers managed to infiltrate and infect Kaseya’s software is not known. This is not the first time Kaseya’s software has been compromised; a smaller ransomware incident occurred in 2019. How the ransomware infiltrates corporate servers From therecord.media/… — According to security firm Sophos and Kaseya customers who spoke with The Record the malicious Kaseya update is reaching VSA on-premise servers from where using the internal scripting engine the ransomware is deployed to all connected client systems. Per Mark Loman a Sophos malware analyst on a host systems the REvil gang disables local antivirus solutions and then deploys a fake Windows Defender app that runs the actual ransomware binary that encrypts a victim’s files. The following tweet has a screen-dump of an infected system not something you ever want to see. The linked article has lots of details with regular updates. Supply chain attack of Kaseya commonly used in managed service provider environments in the United States leading to mass ransomware event.Details in link and thread as they develop:https://t.co/YStENYMTdW The Ransom If your endpoint is hit the initial ransom demand is 44999 USD. pic.twitter.com/gSWbxYJbeX However it looks like the ransom demand is much larger — $5M — for large corporations. From therecord.media/… - In a Zoom call today Mark Loman malware analyst for security firm Sophos told The Record that the attack is massive in nature based on the company’s telemetry which helped the Sophos team spot the attack early on. Loman said that companies who have been impacted are seeing ransom notes of $50000 (if their infected systems is not domain joined) or $5 million (if the computer is domain joined and a clear sign the system is part of a large corporate network). U.S Government Action CISA the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is aware is taking action and sending our alerts. .@CISAgov is taking action to understand and address the supply-chain #ransomware attack against Kaseya VSA and the multiple #MSPs that employ VSA software. Review the Kaseya advisory and immediately follow their guidance to shutdown VSA servers: https://t.co/48QLkEm1eY Who is affected? Potentially any organization that uses Kaseya’s VSA software directly or via an MSP. There are lots of small and medium sized companies which most of us have never heard of all which have IT systems and who rely on such software and on MSPs to manage their IT systems. There is some more info on Kaseya’s client base at enlyft.com/… and www.featuredcustomers.com/...  A quick primer on Ransomware A ransomware attack is where a hacker organization sneaks in a malicious piece of software to a PC desktop computer or a server similar to virus software. This can be done by tricking a user into downloading malware or by tricking server software into downloading it or by inserting it as a Trojan into some vendor software that periodically gets downloaded. The ransomware software uses all sorts of sophisticated tricks to evade detection by anti-virus software including disabling the anti-virus software itself. The malicious software runs and encrypts the contents of all the data files on the hard disk and on accessible servers making the files unusable. E.g. the sentence “The cow jumped over the moon” gets replaced by something like “xkM?j89*j&%66Nk8k>\07hbT[9Z!”. No modern organization can function if its data files are overwritten by gibberish. The files can be restored to their original content by the hacker since he/she knows the secret password which was used to encrypt the files. The hackers demand a ransom amount typically paid using crypto-currency to restore the files. REvil The description of REvil from the wiki page is mind-boggling — it operates like a franchise with revenue sharing with affiliates all under the protection of Russia. REvil (Ransomware Evil; also known as Sodinokibi) is a private ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation. After an attack REvil would threaten to publish the information on their page 'Happy Blog' unless the ransom is received. REvil recruits affiliates to distribute the ransomware for them. As part of this arrangement the affiliates and ransomware developers split revenue generated from ransom payments. It is difficult to pinpoint their exact location but they are thought to be based in Russia due to the fact that the group does not target Russian organizations or those in former Soviet-bloc countries. The operations are getting even more sophisticated — with venture capital -like investments funding the development of ransomware software - First the idea of a "hacker's court" for #hackers to seek justice when they'd been wronged blew us away. And now we're hearing about...a venture capital ecosystem for #ransomware attackers to back #cybercrime operations for a cut of the earnings? 🤪 https://t.co/ilZbNoA4DS One has to wonder why the FBI CIA Interpol and other law enforcement agencies can’t catch these criminals and put them out of business? Epilogue This will be a July 4 nightmare for many companies and their clients. Let’s hope IT security professional and U.S government agencies can stop this attack from spreading. It is frustrating that the IT industry and government agencies cannot neutralize this evil threat. Might the last 4 years of deliberate mismanagement have contributed to the rise of this technology? How do you think industry and government should address this growing scourge? Is it an intractable problem given the way current software and the Internet is designed and our reliance of just two Operating Systems — Windows and Linux? Is it a matter of will and investment? Should there be a Manhattan Project to address this issue? It is not just about ransomware but the ability of state and non-state bad actors to knock out critical infrastructure which we all depend on — power generation and distribution pipelines transportation banks hospitals communications weapon systems ... Updates There are hopeful signs that the attack may have slowed down. The reddit site has an ongoing thread on the subject. What’s with the BLM mentions? Sounds like a cheap attempt to divert blame towards minorities and progressives. There’s an ongoing thread for this here: https://t.co/1gr8JZ0AM4Things seem to have calmed down after initial victims so either attackers stopped or vendor did something. Huntress Labs at www.reddit.com/… Based on a combination of the service providers reaching out to us for assistance along with the comments we're seeing in this thread it's reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses. The situation in Sweden is quite worrisome — I've done a quick update about the Kaseya ransomware situation focusing on the situation in Sweden. It's pretty extraordinary and only scratches the surface on impact. https://t.co/YStENYMTdW pic.twitter.com/Y3w0rnvvbd It appears that the ransomware was not part of a software update but that it directly attacked servers running Kaseya software by exploiting a security vulnerability in the software which Kaseya was aware of and was in the processing of fixing. It appears that a Kaseya zero-day was used in Friday's attacks-bug was reported to Kaseya weeks before by @DIVDnl -unclear how details about the bug reached the REvil affiliate involved in the Friday attackshttps://t.co/A5OabOPD01 pic.twitter.com/39iiP86x6F REvil has raised the ransom money for some victims probably depending on the size of the organization. REvil is increasing ransoms for Kaseya ransomware attack victims - @LawrenceAbramshttps://t.co/wShj9lS6pP REvil now demanding lump-sum $70 million to decrypt all files. Scoop/breaking: The REvil ransomware gang is asking for $70 million to publish a universal decryptor that can unlock all computers locked during the Kaseya incidenthttps://t.co/dvbnOesLGJ pic.twitter.com/M0a4QKwgYo
