L, ðŸ¤– Amazon fires by Robot !, LL Brown, 2021-07-05, One more reason to boycott AMAZON. You will be fired by an algorithm. Bezos is such a scrooge that he won't even waste a ðŸ¤– robotic talking head on your termination.Â  We need strong labor unions!  " According to a report by Bloomberg Flex drivers who are Amazon contract workers and not granted the protections reserved for full-time employees are beingÂ hired and firedÂ via an app. A software program monitors each worker to determine whether they are working quickly enough whether they are driving safely enough and whether they are efficiently meeting their delivery quotas. That this program is rife with errors and punishes workers for things that are not their fault from traffic problems to incorrect delivery directions does not seem to concern Amazon. Workers haveÂ often complainedÂ about the unfair monitoring and lack of human oversight but Amazon has maintained its system. www.bloomberg.com/...
