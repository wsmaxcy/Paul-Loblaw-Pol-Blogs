L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, republicinsanity, 2021-07-05, Welcome to what is the 1000th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders the political legacy that sprung from the Fundamentalist-kooky loins of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and whom is seeking the office of Governor of Arkansas in the 2022 elections. While we had more than one person contact the blog to “nominate” Trump Administration Press Secretaries from about the point Sean Spicer wanted the American people to believe the Trump Inauguration was an attendance-shattering event normally we don’t profile appointees only folks who are in elected office or seeking it. With Huckabee-Sanders trying to follow in her daddy’s Fundie footsteps as the latest GOP nepotism project we’re obligated to do a deep-dive into her now in the hopes we can have the equivalent of an intervention with Arkansas voters before they go and guarantee themselves a world of misery during her prospective tenure.Let’s go back a bit farther though… Sarah Huckabee-Sanders got her start working on political campaigns and her only real successes were in Arkansas. Her father’s 2002 gubernatorial campagin? Win. As a field director for the Bush re-election campaign in ’04? Well that was a win. In 2010 she worked on the re-election campaign for Senator John Boozman and with the Tea Party Wave making that an easy win in any state let alone one as red as Arkansas. Boozman didn’t even campaign at home at the time he let Huckabee-Sanders do it for him and defend the move by saying he was trying to stop the ACA from getting passed in Washington (and he won re-election easily despite mailing it in).  Now let’s talk presidential campaign work… in 2008 Huckabee-Sanders helped lead her father to a 34% victory in the GOP’s Iowa Caucus proving what bulls*** it is yet again (the winner of it since this year has not won the party’s nomination). Her dad’s campaign eventually fell to John McCain’s when he dropped out in March 2008 because well we’ve profiled Mike Huckabee and how truly bats*** he is. In 2012 her father wasn’t running so Huckabee-Sanders hitched her caboose onto the Tim Pawlenty campaign and he bailed after their “all in on Iowa” strategy still only netted a third place finish in that year’s Ames Straw Poll and he bailed leaving her on the sidelines faster than in any year prior. How about in 2016? Was she on the Trump train? No not at first she was back working for her paw and when Mike Huckabee dropped out after the Iowa Caucuses in February 2016 after getting only 1.8% of the vote.  About three weeks later and looking for a paycheck the Trump 2016 campaign scooped her up to try and troubleshoot a problem they knew they were going to have going forward… how would a man so utterly immoral as Donald Trump ever win over Evangelical voters? Wouldn’t they rally around Ted Cruz who flogs that horse like it owes him money? Well using most of her father’s connections and friendships with Evangelical leaders they twisted themselves in knots to justify why Trump was somehow not the devil incarnate and with a little help from Vladimir Putin and social media not stopping lies in their tracks Trump won the election and helped get Sarah Huckabee Sanders a job in the White House as Deputy Press Secretary.Let us review a timeline of her most egregious lies and disturbing moments from a near two-year fascist propaganda spree: And so we summarize all of the above by pointing out how hypocritically cruel Sarah Huckabee-Sanders is. She can straight-up lie to the American people about the Mueller Investigation lie about James Comey’s firing lie about Stormy Daniel’s payoff and lie about Brett Kavanaugh but when Michelle Wolf jokes about her trying to make lying somehow glamorous she bleats about being the victim and tries to get a rising star’s career killed. She can be a part of an administration that’s tearing children away from their families preventing them from having proper legal representation shoving them in cages and to live in cramped diseased conditions… but if someone denies her a chicken sandwich she wants their business shuttered. She insists she’s honest and wanted to put her best foot forward as Press Secretary when she spent her entire tenure berating any reporter who wasn’t from Fox OANN or Newsmax for daring to ask her a question… and then would run to her “safe space” on Fox News rather than even face journalists who might actually ask her a question she didn’t like.She has already demonstrated a pathological will to lie a willingness to defend the worst people and policies that are unnecessarily cruel and inhumane even twisting her own religion to use as a cudgel and hit others with. A religion whose own martyr was a refugee and she’ll dig in to demonize and explain away why it’s great to lock up a child until the guy from PLAYBOY MAGAZINE WAS THE TRUE MORAL COMPASS IN THE ROOM.Should she be elected Governor of Arkansas expect her to grant the Walton family all the tax breaks to cut every part of the state social security net to help the poor while raising their taxes instead and then deciding that somehow the Bible says “hunger is a great incentive to work”. Expect her to sign all the anti-transgender and anti-gay bills the legislature sends to her if she isn’t bold enough to write an executive order to do it. Expect her to go full Aunt Lydia from Handmaid’s Tale and try to overturn Roe v. Wade to win the approval of her father she’ll never probably truly have because he’s too enamored with his sons even if they murder dogs.We’re crossing our fingers and hoping that maybe the voters of Arkansas pick up on the fact that the Huckabee family has been conning them for almost a quarter century now and that it might be a good idea to not let them keep doing it for another four to eight years.       One Year Ago July 5th 2020: Derrick Grayson (GA)Two Years Ago July 5th 2019: Cindy Frich (WV)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago July 5th 2018: Cindy Frich (WV)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago July 5th 2017: Cindy Frich (WV)… Original ProfileFive Year Ago July 5th 2016: Brian Kurcaba (WV)…2016 UpdateSix Years Ago July 5th 2015: Brian Kurcaba (WV)… Original Profile
