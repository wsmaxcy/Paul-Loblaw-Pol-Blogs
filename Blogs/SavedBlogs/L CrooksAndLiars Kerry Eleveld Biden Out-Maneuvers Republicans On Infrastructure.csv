L, Biden Out-Maneuvers Republicans On Infrastructure, Kerry Eleveld, 2021-06-29, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  "We have a deal" President Joe Biden announced Thursday celebrating the framework of a bipartisan infrastructure deal  worth $1.2 trillion only about $580 billion of which would be new  spending.   “They have my word I’ll stick with what they’ve proposed" Biden said flanked by a core group of Senate Democrats and Republicans. "And they've given me their word as well. Where I come from that's good enough for me."   But less than 24 hours after the kumbaya moment the  word of Republicans carried less weight than a phone number drunkenly  scribbled on a bev nap after last call. GOP senators claimed they were  shocked indeed "blindsided"  by the president's intention to continue pushing a separate  Democrats-only bill to invest several trillion dollars more into his  health care education climate and child care initiatives.    Later on Thursday Biden had explicitly outlined the necessity  of passing a separate reconciliation bill telling reporters it was  imperative that his other priorities be addressed in a measure that  would be negotiated by Democrats alone.    “If this is the only thing that comes to me I’m not signing it” Biden said of the bipartisan infrastructure deal. “It’s in tandem.”          "GOP infrastructure negotiators fume over Biden's handling of their deal" read a POLITICO headline.    Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas was reportedly "wavering"  in his support for the deal. In order for him to stay on board Moran  was demanding assurances from the chief Democratic conveners of the  group—Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West  Virginia—that they would oppose passing a Democrats-only bill through  the Senate procedure known as reconciliation.   "No deal by extortion!" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complained  in a Friday tweet. "It was never suggested to me during these  negotiations that President Biden was holding hostage the bipartisan  infrastructure proposal unless a liberal reconciliation package was also  passed."   Wait who's holding who hostage? No one forced Senate  Republicans to sign onto something that might actually do good for the  nation—like creating jobs and modernizing our ailing infrastructure.  Meanwhile Graham and Moran are both threatening to jump ship unless  Democrats forfeit Biden's other domestic priorities. In the first  instance Republicans get to exercise free will—choosing whether to  support or not support the deal. In the second Republicans are making  their support conditional on Democrats surrendering to their dictates.    How novel that Graham is accusing Biden of doing precisely the  thing he himself is doing—hostage-taking. Seriously Republicans must  get up every morning look in the mirror and practice saying "No you're the ones who stole the election! No you're the traitors!" Projective disinformation is just bread-and-butter GOP politicking now.   Anyway Republicans are now claiming Biden negotiated in bad  faith because he never told them something Democrats have actually been  talking about publicly for months—that they were pursuing two tracks a  smaller bipartisan deal and a bigger reconciliation package.   Following the GOP uproar it didn't take long for the Democratic Party to assemble a few links documenting the recent history of what everyone who has been living on this planet has been fully aware of for months.    Just a couple weeks ago POLITICO actually reported an entire piece about the GOP  plan to secure the smaller bipartisan package in hopes that it would  kill Democratic momentum for a larger reconciliation bill on Biden's  other priorities.   “It’ll be awful hard to get those moderate Democrats to be for  [reconciliation]” said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota the Senate  GOP's No. 2 deputy. “The stars are kind of lining up for an  infrastructure bill. And if you do do something bipartisan on that then  I think doing something partisan on reconciliation—in some ways with  certain Democrats—it gets a lot harder.”   Huh. Sure sounds like Senate Republicans damn well knew  Democrats were hoping to get a companion bill even if they managed to  secure a bipartisan deal.   And as far back as mid-May none other than Sen. Shelley Moore  Capito of West Virginia the lead GOP negotiator in the original  bipartisan talks said President Biden explicitly told Republicans he  hoped to address a second set of priorities through a Democrats-only  reconciliation bill according to ABC News' congressional journalist Trish Turner. Capito even said that wasn't a deal breaker for her.   “I mean why wouldn't we work with the President of the United  States to improve our infrastructure or make any other improvements in  the country?" Capito said.  "We know that they have that [reconciliation] option we used that  option in 2017” she added referring to the GOP's wildly unpopular tax  giveaway to the rich.   And earlier this month Minority Leader Mitch McConnell mused “We are anticipating at some point getting a reconciliation bill.”   So not exactly "blindsided."   On Thursday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Biden's  sentiments on linking the bills saying the House wouldn't move on any  bill until both bills had cleared the Senate. She added “If  there is no bipartisan bill we’ll just go when the Senate passes a  reconciliation bill." In other words the reconciliation bill is the  must-have: House Democrats aren't moving without it. Pelosi is clearly  reflecting the realities of her caucus and she doesn't think she can  get a strictly bipartisan bill passed without the progressive priorities  in a companion bill.   But even better both Manchin and Sinema have indicated a continued openness to the reconciliation package.    "Reconciliation is inevitable" Manchin told reporters noting that the two-track strategy was "the only strategy we have."   Sinema similarly said she was "open to finding a path forward" on what she called a "two-phase process."   That was the Biden’s masterstroke—making certain Sinema and Manchin would return to the table for a Democrats-only bill.   For now Americans have a chummy picture of President Biden  standing outside the White House with Senate Republicans and Democrats  reassuring the public that the two parties can still deliver for them.  "We have a deal" was the either the headline or the lede of nearly every  mainstream story that accompanied that picture.   If Republicans walk on that deal it will be on them to explain  why they couldn't follow through on doing something good for the  country—and that's apparently because Democrats insisted on doing other  good things too. It’s a point White House press secretary Jen Psaki seized on.     “It will be up to Republicans to decide if they’re going to vote  against a historic investment in infrastructure … simply because they do  not like the mechanics of the process” Psaki said. “That’s a pretty  absurd argument for them to make; good luck on the political front.”     But Republicans reneging will also give Biden an opportunity to  make the case to Sinema and Manchin that he went the extra mile and now  reconciliation is the only way forward.   If Republicans stay Biden will get to tout a huge win on  bipartisanship proving the theory of the case he articulated on the  2020 campaign trail to much ridicule. It will also give Manchin and  Sinema incentive to do right by the White House on a reconciliation  measure that ropes in more of Biden's priorities.    Ultimately if Biden gets a solidly progressive reconciliation  bill through Congress—regardless of whether a bipartisan deal  accompanies it—he will have out-maneuvered Republicans.   We likely won't know how this all shakes out until late summer  or even fall given that both bills have yet to be written and clearly  negotiations remain tenuous. But whether Republicans stay or go  President Biden left the week in a much stronger position to bring along  his two most challenging Democratic senators on a reconciliation  package that promises to make or break his legacy.
