As two Americans unaccustomed to palaces and pomp we didn’t know what to expect. We shouldn’t have worried. The Queen and Prince Philip immediately put us at ease with their grace and generosity turning a ceremonial occasion into something far more natural even comfortable. Prince Philip in particular was kind and warm with a sharp wit and unfailing good humor. It was our first introduction to the man behind the title and in the years since our admiration for him has only grown. We will miss him dearly. President Joe Biden released a statement of his own on Friday writing “Jill and I are keeping the Queen and Prince Philip’s children grandchildren and great-grandchildren in our hearts during this time.” “On behalf of all the people of the United States we send our deepest condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II the entire Royal Family and all the people of the United Kingdom on the death of His Royal Highness Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh” the White House statement said. “Over the course of his 99-year life he saw our world change dramatically and repeatedly.” Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W.
