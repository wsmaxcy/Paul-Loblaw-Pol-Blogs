L, White Supremacists Chased Out Of City Of Brotherly Love, Ed Scarce, 2021-07-04, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Not sure what the thinking was for these two-bit Nazis to march in Philadelphia on the eve of the Fourth of July and expect anything less than this type of reaction. Maybe they were hoping to become martyrs or something. In any event no one seems to have been seriously injured and it's unclear if anyone was ultimately arrested though many of these doofuses were handcuffed and questioned by the police. Source: NBC Philadelphia A group of white supremacists marched in front of Philadelphia City Hall Saturday night drawing jeers from onlookers as well as small scuffles. The group of dozens of men wore white face coverings kakis blue shirts and tan hats and waved flags with insignias appearing to belong to the Patriot Front organization. They were seen approaching from Market Street before walking in front of City Hall shortly after 11 p.m. Some could be seen holding shields as watchers-on shouted at them demanding they leave Philadelphia. Nothing like taking your kids to Philadelphia for the 4th & running into literal Nazis. These scumbags belong to the group Patriot Front. That may or may not be my kids & I joining a growing crowd yelling at the spineless dickholes & chasing them away from City Hall. #fucknazis pic.twitter.com/bqYviUq1Bd ‚Äî Not Today (@SunnyDelight888) July 4 2021 Which lead to this embarrassing retreat when the locals from Philly heard what was happening. Add this to an embarrassing day for Nazis.
