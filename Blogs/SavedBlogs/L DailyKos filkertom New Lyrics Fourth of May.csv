L, New Lyrics: "Fourth of May", filkertom, 2021-05-04, Hey all! Just a silly for Star Wars Day. I hope to record it by this afternoon. For your Star Wars Day pleasure a new song (to the tune of “First of May” by Jonathan Coulton): In nineteen seventy sevenMy life was changed for goodA little independent movieOpened in my neighborhood A princess led a rebellionAgainst the evil galactic empireAnd Luke blew up the Death Star justAs it was gonna open fire. And I said ooh chile never seen so manySpaceships on this one missionOoh chile in forty years we gonnastart us a new traditionOnline... Cause it's the fourth of May fourth of MayMay the fourth be with you todayWith Chewie Han and LeiaAnd Kylo Ren and Rey.Jawas say “Ootini” in their sandcrawlerAnakin hits on Padme AmidalaYavin below you Bespin aboveCelebrate spring with a crazy little thing called…Star Wars Day. It's really all about Darth VaderHow he starts out as a little kid.(We wish midichlorians didn't existBut of course they did.) He really liked Princess PadmeHe really didn't like sandThen he killed all the younglingsAnd Obi-Wan cut off his legs and hand And I said ooh chile they should had pre-natalCare for your wife and childrenOoh chile you're gonna be one of theCinema’s greatest villainsOnline 'Cause it's the fourth of May fourth of MayMay the fourth be with you todayWith Qui-Gonn Jinn and YodaMighty Jabba and BB-8Jawas say “Ootini” in their sandcrawlerAnakin hits on Padme AmidalaYavin below you Bespin aboveCelebrate spring with a crazy little thing called…Star Wars Day. So now it's forty-four years laterIt's still in everything that I doI named my little Corgi Jar JarMy kids Threepio and Artoo. I carry round a big light saberColored purple like Mace Windu’sI tried to use the Force on a parking copGot not one ticket but two. And I say ooh chile the games and stories and theUniverse is expandingOoh chile in forty years I’ll still beLoud and proud and standingOnline... 'Cause it's the fourth of May fourth of MayMay the fourth be with you todayFinn and Poe and Rose  and LandoAnd Greedo got blown away.…(HAN SHOT FIRST)Jawas say “Ootini” in their sandcrawlerAnakin hits on Padme AmidalaYavin below you Bespin aboveCelebrate spring with a crazy little thing called…Star Wars Day.Star Wars Day.This is the Way!I have spoken.
