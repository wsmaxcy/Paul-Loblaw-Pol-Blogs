L, Matt Gaetz's Wingman Has So Much Tea He Needs 90 More Days To Spill It, Susie Madrak, 2021-07-07, We need your help now more than ever.

First that Matt Gaetz is in deep deep trouble and second that the investigation may be branching out to even more Florida politicians. Oh darn! We wouldn't want Floridians to lose trust in their stellar representatives! Via CNBC: A lawyer for Joel Greenberg a key figure in the federal probe involving Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz asked a judge Tuesday to delay the former county tax collector‚Äôs sentencing date by 90 days citing his continued cooperation with federal prosecutors. Greenberg who in May admitted to crimes including sex trafficking of a minor and identity theft agreed in a plea deal to provide ‚Äúsubstantial assistance‚Äù to federal authorities in any investigation. That could include a federal probe which reportedly grew out of Greenberg‚Äôs case looking into possible sex trafficking by the Florida congressman. Obviously the longer prosecutors find him helpful the worse it gets for anyone else who cavorted with him. Joel Greenberg requests delay of sentencing scheduled for August on the grounds his cooperation will not be completed by then. Filing also states future restitution figures "involve multiple parties" and will not be discerned by then either. Prosecutors do not oppose. üëÄüëÄ ‚Äî Robert J. DeNault (@robertjdenault) July 6 2021 In a court document filed Tuesday Joel Greenberg asked a federal judge to push back his sentencing. The letter describes ‚Äúongoing cooperation which will not be completed prior to his current sentencing date" https://t.co/BOQunm5Rcl ‚Äî The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) July 7 2021 I‚Äôm not sure enough people know that the Joel Greenberg scandal extends potentially to Florida‚Äôs elections. I can barely keep track myself. https://t.co/04RrqIUOKl ‚Äî Jennifer Cohn ‚úçüèª üì¢ (@jennycohn1) June 30 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
