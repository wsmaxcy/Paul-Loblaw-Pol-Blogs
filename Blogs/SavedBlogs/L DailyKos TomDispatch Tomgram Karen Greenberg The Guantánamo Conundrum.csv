It seemed obvious enough to me in 2006. When you included the CIA’s “black sites” around the globe (where prisoners from the war on terror were being kept and regularly tortured) American military prisons like the shocking Abu Ghraib in Iraq which had just then been emptied and the huge military prison camps named Bucca and Cropper which remained in use as well as military prisons in Afghanistan and the already infamous detention center at Guantánamo Bay Cuba the United States had by my calculation then at least 15000 prisoners most “being held… most beyond the eyes of any system of justice beyond the reach of any judges or juries.” In other words as I put it at the time the Bush administration had established its very own offshore “Bermuda triangle of injustice” beyond the reach of any conception of American law. It was put bluntly an all-American mini-gulag filled with grotesque acts whose offshore “crown jewel” was of course Guantánamo. As I wrote then “Whatever the discussion may be whatever issues may seem to be gripping Washington or the nation whatever you’re watching on TV or reading in the papers elsewhere the continual constructing enlarging expanding entrenching of a new global system of imprisonment which bears no relation to any system of imprisonment Americans have previously imagined continues non-stop unchecked and unbalanced by Congress or the courts unaffected by the Republic but very distinctly under the flag ‘for which it stands.'” Six years later in 2012 Karen Greenberg director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law who had by then produced a grim and striking book on the first days of that prison camp at Guantánamo Bay arrived at TomDispatch. She soon began writing on American global torture practices and how for instance the “thou shalt nots” that Barack Obama had entered the Oval Office with including thou shalt not keep Guantánamo open had sadly become thou shalts. Still if you had asked either of us then whether almost a decade later that crown jewel in Cuba would still be open we both would have doubted it. And yet here we are in May 2021 in the early months of the fourth administration since its establishment and open it is. With that in mind it seemed all too obvious and appropriate as President Biden begins to deal with this country’s never-ending war on terror to call on Greenberg to consider the subject of the prison from hell’s closure once again and hope that it doesn’t outlive us all. Tom The Guantánamo conundrum never seems to end. Twelve years ago I had other expectations. I envisioned a writing project that I had no doubt would be part of my future: an account of Guantánamo’s last 100 days. I expected to narrate in reverse the episodes in a book I had just published The Least Worst Place: Guantánamo’s First 100 Days about — well the title makes it all too obvious — the initial days at that grim offshore prison. They began on January 11 2002 as the first hooded prisoners of the American war on terror were ushered off a plane at that American military base on the island of Cuba. Needless to say I never did write that book. Sadly enough in the intervening years there were few signs on the horizon of an imminent closing of that U.S. military prison. Weeks before my book was published in February 2009 President Barack Obama did in fact promise to close Guantánamo by the end of his first year in the White House. That hope began to unravel with remarkable speed. By the end of his presidency his administration had in fact managed to release 197 of the prisoners held there without charges — many including Mohamedou Ould Slahi the subject of the film The Mauritanian had also been tortured — but 41 remained including the five men accused but not yet tried for plotting the 9/11 attacks. Forty remain there to this very day. Nearly 20 years after it began the war in Afghanistan that launched this country’s Global War on Terror and the indefinite detention of prisoners in that facility offshore of American justice is now actually slated to end. President Biden recently insisted that it is indeed “time to end America’s longest war” and announced that all American troops would be withdrawn from that country by September 11th the 20th anniversary of al-Qaeda’s attack on the United States. It makes sense of course that the conclusion of those hostilities would indeed be tied to the closure of the now-notorious Guantánamo Bay detention facility. Unfortunately for reasons that go back to the very origins of the war on terror ending the Afghan part of this country’s “forever wars” may not presage the release of those “forever prisoners” as New York Times reporter Carol Rosenberg so aptly labeled them years ago. Biden and Guantánamo Just as President Biden has a history dating back to his years as Obama’s vice-president of wanting to curtail the American presence in Afghanistan so he called years ago for the closure of Guantánamo. As early as June 2005 then-Senator Biden expressed his desire to shut that facility seeing it as a stain on this country’s reputation abroad. At the time he proposed that an independent commission take a look at Guantánamo Bay and make recommendations as to its future. “But” he said then “I think we should end up shutting it down moving those prisoners. Those that we have reason to keep keep. And those we don’t let go.” Sixteen years later he has indeed put in motion an interagency review to look into that detention facility’s closing. Hopefully once he receives its report his administration can indeed begin to shut the notorious island prison down. (And this time it could even work.) It’s true that in 2021 the idea of shutting the gates on Guantánamo has garnered some unprecedented mainstream support. As part of his confirmation process Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for instance signaled his support for its closure. And Congress long unwilling to lend a hand has offered some support as well. On April 16th 24 Democratic senators signed a letter to the president calling that facility a “symbol of lawlessness and human rights abuses” that “continues to harm U.S. national security” and demanding that it be shut. As those senators wrote “For nearly two decades the offshore prison has damaged America’s reputation fueled anti-Muslim bigotry and weakened the United States’ ability to counter terrorism and fight for human rights and the rule of law around the world. In addition to the $540 million in wasted taxpayer dollars each year to maintain and operate the facility the prison also comes at the price of justice for the victims of 9/11 and their families who are still waiting for trials to begin.” Admittedly the number of signatories on that letter raises many questions including why there aren’t more (and why there isn’t a single Republican among them). Is it just a matter of refusing to give up old habits or does it reflect a lack of desire to address an issue long out of the headlines? Where for example was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s name not to mention those other 25 missing Democratic senatorial signatures? And there’s another disappointment lurking in its text. While those senators correctly demanded a reversal of the Trump administration’s “erroneous and troubling legal positions” regarding the application of international and domestic law to Guantánamo they failed to expand upon the larger context of that forever nightmare of imprisonment lawlessness and cruelty that affected the war-on-terror prisoners at Guantánamo as well as at the CIA’s “black sites” around the world. Still that stance by those two-dozen senators is significant since Congress has in the past taken such weak positions on closing the prison. As such it provides some hope for the future. For the rest of Congress and the rest of us when thinking about finally putting Guantánamo in the history books it’s important to remember just what a vast deviation it proved to be from the law justice and the norms of this society. It’s also worth thinking about the American “detainees” there in the context of what normally happens when wars end. Prisoners of War Defying custom and law the American war in Afghanistan broke through norms like a battering ram through a gossamer wall. Guantánamo was created in just that context a one-of-a-kind institution for this country. Now so many years later it’s poised to break through yet another norm. Usually at the end of hostilities battlefield detainees are let go. As Geneva Convention III the law governing the detention and treatment of prisoners of war asserts: “Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.” That custom of releasing prisoners has in practice pertained not only to those held on or near the battlefield but even to those detained far from the conflict. Before the Geneva Conventions were created the custom of releasing such prisoners was already in place in the United States. Notably during World War II the U.S. held 425000 mostly German prisoners in more than 500 camps in this country. When the war ended however they were released and the vast majority of them were returned to their home countries. When it comes to the closure of Guantánamo however we can’t count on such an ending. Two war-on-terror realities stand in the way of linking the coming end of hostilities in Afghanistan to the shutting down of that prison. First the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed right after the 9/11 attacks was not geographically defined or limited to the war in Afghanistan. It focused on but was not confined to two groups the Taliban and al-Qaeda as well as anyone else who had contributed to the attacks of 9/11. As such it was used as well to authorize military engagements — and the capture of prisoners — outside Afghanistan. Since 2001 in fact it has been cited to authorize the use of force in Pakistan Yemen Somalia and elsewhere.Of the 780 prisoners held at Guantánamo Bay at one time or another more than a third came from Afghanistan; the remaining two-thirds were from 48 other countries. A second potential loophole exists when it comes to the release of prisoners as that war ends. The administration of George W. Bush rejected the very notion that those held at Guantánamo were prisoners of war no matter how or where they had been captured. As non-state actors according to that administration they were exempted from prisoner of war status which is why they were deliberately labeled “detainees.” Little wonder then that despite Secretary of Defense Austin’s position on Guantánamo as the New York Times recently reported Pentagon spokesman John Kirby “argued that there was no direct link between its future and the coming end to what he called the ‘mission’ in Afghanistan.” In fact even if that congressional authorization for war and the opening of Guantánamo on which it was based never were solely linked to the conflict in Afghanistan it’s time almost two decades later to put an end to that quagmire of a prison camp and the staggering exceptions that it’s woven into this country’s laws and norms since 2002. A “Forever Prison”? The closing of Guantánamo would finally signal an end to the otherwise endless proliferation of exceptions to the laws of war as well as to U.S. domestic and military legal codes. As early as June 2004 Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor flagged the possibility that a system of indefinite detention at Guantánamo could create a permanent state of endless legal exceptionalism. She wrote an opinion that month in a habeas corpus case for the release of a Guantánamo detainee the dual U.S.-Saudi citizen Yaser Hamdi warning that the prospect of turning that military prison into a never-ending exception to wartime detention and its laws posed dangers all its own. As she put it “We understand Congress’ grant of authority for the use of ‘necessary and appropriate force’ to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles.” She also acknowledged that “If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war that [the] understanding [of release upon the end of hostilities] may unravel. But” she concluded “that is not the situation we face as of this date.” Sadly enough 17 years later it turns out that the detention authority may be poised to outlive the use of force. Guantánamo has become an American institution at the cost of $13 million per prisoner annually. The system of offshore injustice has by now become part and parcel of the American system of justice — our very own “forever prison.” The difficulty of closing Guantánamo has shown that once you move outside the laws and norms of this country in a significant way the return to normalcy becomes ever more problematic — and the longer the exception the harder such a restoration will be. Remember that before his presidency was over George W. Bush went on record acknowledging his preference for closing Guantánamo. Obama made it a goal of his presidency from the outset. Biden with less fanfare and the lessons of their failures in mind faces the challenge of finally closing America’s forever prison. With all that in mind let me offer you a positive twist on this seemingly never-ending situation. I won’t be surprised if in fact President Biden actually does manage to close Guantánamo. He may not do so as a result of the withdrawal of all American forces from Afghanistan but because he seems to have a genuine urge to shut the books on the war on terror or at least the chapter of it initiated on 9/11. And if he were also to shut down that prison in the spirit of that letter from the Democratic senators it would be because of Guantánamo’s gross violations of American laws and norms. While the letter did not go so far as to name the larger war-on-terror sins of the past it did at least draw attention directly to the wrongfulness of indefinite detention as a system created expressly to evade the law — and one that brought ill-repute to the United States globally. That closure should certainly happen under President Biden. After all any other course is not only legally unacceptable but risks perpetuating the idea that this country continues to distrust the principles of law human rights and due process – indeed the very fundamentals of a democratic system.
