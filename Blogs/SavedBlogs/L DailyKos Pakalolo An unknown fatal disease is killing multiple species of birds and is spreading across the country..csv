L, An unknown fatal disease is killing multiple species of birds and is spreading across the country., Pakalolo, 2021-07-07, There is something deadly weird coming out of the nation's capital. Washington D.C. is the epicenter of a fatal disease rapidly expanding outward from the city and capable of killing multiple species of wild birds. The disease has been confirmed as far away as Indiana. According to reporting from DW the birds have swollen eyes and some signs of a neurological disorder that upends their balance.  Scientists have not ruled out that the disease could jump species including us.   The United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report on the mysterious bird deaths in early June. Details remain hazy but experts are trying to trace the epidemic back to its origins. "The first one we saw was in April. In the beginning of June that's when we started sending birds to an animal center where they were alarmed to hear our numbers at the time. Now we're up to just under 200 that are infected" Monsma says. Animal centers have been examining the birds for a possible cause of death or illness but tests have been inconclusive so far. "West Nile [disease] is ruled out. . . Everything has been ruled out. To date we still do not know" says Monsma citing tests conducted by Wildlife's clinic director Cheryl Chooljian. There is a breakout of unknown diseases in Europe that appears to be infecting mainly blue tits. Other species may be infected as well but that has not been confirmed according to reports. Experts do still have their theories. And one of them links the disease with the arrival of Brood-X cicadas that made their appearance around late April to early May — the same time people started to notice the dead birds. It's just a theory but it is something to work on according to ornithologists. And continued research is important because another bird flu could prove very dangerous for people as well. "We are losing our population of birds at an alarming rate" says Monsma including Fledglings European Starlings Bluejays and others. "About a third of the species in America are decreasing rapidly. It's spreading to other species" he says. "And we certainly cannot rule out the possibility that it might spread to humans." Scientists in some areas have urged the public to remove their feeders and birdbaths where different species congregate. Pet owners are urged not to let their dogs near the body of a dead bird. These actions will hopefully contain the spread of the disease officials from the USGS said.   The likely cause in my estimation is that humans are to blame for this. Climate change is a threat multiplier. Lyme disease is spreading as is a water-borne illness and other diseases. The jury is still out on Covid but habitat destruction may be to blame.
