L, The Daily Bucket.  Graeagle CA.  New Place New Camera New Bird., funningforrestforBackyard Science, 2021-04-29, APRIL 28 2021.  GRAEAGLE CA. Following a few days of late spring stormy weather the day opened bright and fair.  Put the bicycle on the rural bus and headed east to the small-ish resort community of Graeagle CA.  There’s a lot of California lumber and mining history to this town but that’s not what I went there for.  I needed some new territory and photo opportunities for wildlife.  I was rewarded in the end but it was a disheartening start.  The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge. We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below. Each note is a record that we can refer to in the future as we try to understand the phenological patterns that are quietly unwinding around us.

There used to be a very sizable sawmill at Graeagle and the old mill pond remains.  I was thinking “pond therefore water therefore birds”.  I’d been here dozens of times before in fact I’ve even gone swimming in this old mill pond.  Once.  As a kid.  Freezing cold water.  Never again.  But that’s beside the point.  The point is that I figured this was going to be a good place to start.  What I didn’t realize is that it has now been the practice for years as I learned to keep the old mill pond drained during the winter.  I was told this is for the purpose of keeping the water healthy as the pond later gets filled for the summer season.  I also wasn’t counting on the massive pine needle pile being burned that morning out near (and by) the county road department.  This was not an auspicious beginning. Dauntless and undeterred though feeling rather dismal I pedaled slowly around the pond.  As I came to the backside (over where the trees are in the above photo) I was presented with my first chances to get something for my efforts.  First the Turkey Vulture and then it was joined by a companion: As most of you may all know by now I just acquired a new camera a Nikon Coolpix P950 which I have glibly named The Beast.  It’s a handful. With a camera this size most of the shooting I plan to do will be with the camera on a tripod.  But the foregoing photos are all hand-held.  Even this Song Sparrow and I must say I’m inordinately pleased with the results. Having completed my circuit of the old mill pond my other destination for the day was to get down and along a stretch of the Middle Fork of the Feather River.  It’s very easily accessible near Graeagle.  But first I paused to catch a photo of “downtown” Graeagle. Little more than a mile from the town center there’s a bridge that crosses the river.  I pedaled on down to the bridge stopping first for this snap of local history:  But enough posterity.  I’m out here for nature and wildlife.  I parked and locked up my bicycle under the bridge mounted the camera on the tripod and started off down the river bank. As always whenever I’m out it is my ongoing hope to photograph a “first”; be it bird or any other wildlife.  I soon came upon birds in the river sort of the “same old customers” but they’re lovely all the same.   I was under time constraint.  I had to be back in town at the bus stop by 10:30 (otherwise I would have had to wait until after 4:00 p.m. for the bus back to Quincy) and it was already a bit past 9:30 so I hurried on farther downriver.  I got to a nice spot gave the water a look-see through the binoculars and spied some waterfowl about three hundred yards down.  I set the tripod and zoomed in looking through the camera’s Electronic View Finder.  For perspective allow me to give you an idea of where I was and where the birds were: And I got another “first”!  This is the first Merganser Mergus merganser  I’ve ever photographed.  Which by the way brings my 2021 bird species count list to 44.  (The Turkey Vulture was #43.) A closer cropped view: And a couple more.  For the distance I’m more than happy with the resolution.  “The Beast” is turning out to be quite the friendly and stalwart companion.  Final note:  I will unquestionably be returning to this area in the very near future.  There is a lot more river and related environs to explore.  I definitely needed more than the small time window I gave myself.  I’m now wishing I had just stayed the whole day but then… well I’ve got all the more reason to return don’t I? Now It’s Your Turn What have you noted happening in your area or travels?   As usual post your observations as well as their general location in the comments. Thank you.
