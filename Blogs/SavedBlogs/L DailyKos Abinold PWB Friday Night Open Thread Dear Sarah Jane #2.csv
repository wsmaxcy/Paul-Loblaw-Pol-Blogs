L, PWB Friday Night Open Thread: Dear Sarah Jane #2, Abinold, 2021-04-30,   Dear Readers: Every letter I receive is reviewed carefully. However because I receive a very large number of letters I cannot answer everyone. Thank you for your understanding.  A few eager answer-seekers were noted from last week’s column with the promise to respond in this one. Promise kept ! As translated by Strawbale: Dear Sarah Jane my hoomin is reaaly picky about where I sit!  I found this lovely pot of dirr with good-smelling grass in it but she scolds and chases me out of it every time. What to do? Thanks Diana the Huntress AKA Agent of Chaos Dear Chaos This is a perfect example of the human ‘boundries’ conundrum.  Feline experts agree that boundries are a 1-way street when it comes to our beloved but pitiable humans and although we know for a fact that what it their’s is by default ours no amount of training pounds this piece of absolute logic home. My only advice is to continue enjoying your lovely spot and ignore her scolding.  Wear her down. In time she may simply give up. You might also consider chasing her from her favorite sitting spot. Occupy her spot and become very long when she attempts to move you. The Occupy Chair Movement has been quietly fighting fire with fire for hundreds of years. It may work for you.  And another this time translated by elenacarlena: Dear Sarah Jane Meowm doesn’t want to get showers or baths. She hates the feel of soap and water. She doesn’t have a rough tongue to wash herself like pooties do. What should we do? — Hydrophobic  Dear Hydro Chances are she has rabies.  Tho cases are rare we all learned a lesson from Old Yeller.  My condolences.     Be well my fellow heros of felinity!  Enduance is more then half the battle.  Once again chances are I’ll be asleep when this publishes.  I got my 2nd vax yesterday and am feeling it today.  Add gloomy chilly rainy day and I likely won’t last.  Carry on as you always do and I’ll catch up with everything in the morning!   And...Cheers from Maine! p.s. I wonder if there are any querstions from the goggies out there... The latest Community Needs List is here. Note that Jtg’s need  has been met. : ) The Kos Katalogue is here.
