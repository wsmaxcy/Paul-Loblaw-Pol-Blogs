Who are we and what we are trying do → Launching A Dailykos Discussions and Republishing Group For International or Foreign Policy Stuff We use sources and links that might not familiar to most kossacks what with this being a Foreign Policy and International stuffs group. So press right mouse button on links and open in new incognito/private tab/window to reduce your tensions somewhat. Uganda - Congo: A reflection on the war when Uganda invaded DRC  in The Monitor  DRC vs Uganda: When fathers eat sour grapes and children get the sour taste It’s not often that one throws a sermon at the BBC and gets away with their sins; so I think that is why the BBC Swahili Service reporter Isaac Munena chuckled a tad when I summarised my argument in a Bible proverb – Baba wamekula zabibu chachu meno ya watoto yakatiwa ganzi. (The fathers ate the sour grapes [but it is] the children’s teeth [that] are set on edge). Those who have eaten highly acidic fruits like oranges (in excess) will recognise the familiar pain at the edges of the teeth whenever one opens the mouth soon after. It’s not a proverb many people are familiar with since it is in a book that many churches don’t particularly enjoy – that of Jeremiah “The Wailing Prophet” (31:29-30). The Israelites were throwing the proverb around a bit too casually for God’s liking complaining that it was not fair for sins of the fathers to be visited upon the children – who took no part in their fathers’ sins. You’d say the same about former president Idi Amin’s children; but probably hesitate if it came to those of someone else. Not now please. China - US: An interesting column in SCMP columnist got into a pickle in an arguement and now one of those rare admission by Alex Lo that someone else was right in this China is capitalist and the US socialist? You must be joking Some pundits are full of conventional wisdom others try to be contrarian. Weijian Shan is a good mix. One reason is that though he writes the occasional highly provocative commentaries including for this newspaper he is more of a scholar and a big-time investor. He has to put his money – millions and millions – where his mouth is. Recently he rounded on me for making an erroneous claim about China’s nine-dash line in the South China Sea. I thought he misunderstood but he proved to be far more knowledgeable than me. His latest take on China and the United States from an interview with the chief editor of the Harvard Business Review makes many intriguing observations. Bangladesh: Over at The Dhaka Tribune in the backdrop of recent newsabout Hefazat (Hefajat nayeb-e-ameer remanded in 2013 mayhem case). “Hefajat-e-Islam laid seize on capital’s Shapla Chattar area on May 5 2013 unleashing inexpressible atrocities in and around the capital”.  Here an exploration which is likely to catch people by surprise.  OP-ED: The ideology of Hefazat Al-Ma’arri was an Arabic poet philosopher and writer who lived (December 973 – May 1057) during the Islamic Golden Age under the Abbasid era in Aleppo which is in modern Syria. In 2019 Al-Ma’arri statue was vandalized in Syria by the al-Nusra Front about a thousand years after his lifetime because Al-Ma’arri was a rationalist someone we might call a “nastik” (atheist) in Bangladesh. According to some accounts he was a deist. He questioned Islam and its practises; at the same time he was critical of Christianity Judaism and Zoroastrianism. He was an ethical vegetarian who was also an antinatalist. Despite his critical views on religion he was not harassed or harmed during his lifetime. He lived in the centre of the Abbasid Caliphate and yet he did not fear to speak his mind. He lived when Islam was at its zenith and it represented the most advanced civilization in the world. Muslim cities were centres of culture while European cities had a barely functioning sewage system. This was a civilization at the peak of its development filled with optimism and confidence. Denmark: A look into Denmark social politics in The Counter Currents Ethnic Engineering: Denmark’s Ghetto Policy The very word is chilling but has become normalised political currency in Denmark.  Since 2010 the Danish government has resorted to generating “ghetto lists” marking out areas as socially problematic for the state.  In 2018 the country’s parliament passed “ghetto” laws to further regulate the lives of individuals inhabiting various city areas focusing on their racial and ethnic origins.  The legislation constitutes the spear tip of the “One Denmark without Parallel Societies – No Ghettos in 2030” initiative; its target: “non-Western” residents who overbalance the social ledger by concentrating in various city environs. The “ghetto package” comprising over 20 different statutes grants the government power to designate various neighbourhoods as “ghettos” or “tough ghettos”.  That nasty formulation is intended to have consequences for urban planning taking into account the percentage of immigrants and descendants present in that area of “non-Western background”.  One Danish media outlet assiduously avoiding the creepier elements of the policy saw it as the “greatest social experiment of the century.” Bureaucrats consider the following: the number of residents (greater than 1000); a cap of 50% of “non-Westerners”; and whether the neighbourhood meets any two of four criteria namely employment education income and criminality.  Doing so enables the authorities to evict residents demolish buildings and alter the character of the neighbourhood a form of cleansing that has shuddering historical resonances.  Central to this is an effort to reduce the stock of “common family housing” – 40% in tough ghettos by 2030 – supposedly available to all based on principles of affordability democracy and egalitarianism.
