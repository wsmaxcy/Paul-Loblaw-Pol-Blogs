L, I Wish They'd Stop Trying to Tell Us Old Wack Donald Is Relevant - GNR for Bluesday June 29th, NotNowNotEverforGood News, 2021-06-29, Because our corporate media has spent years honing their skill at comparing apples to oranges they’ve lost the ability to explain context and nuance.  Instead they’ve started to find equivalence between apple pies and road apples.  Just because a prominent spokesclown spouts some fertilizer class bunkum doesn’t mean it needs to be taken seriously. I find it depressing that dozens upon dozens of Reichwing operatives are freely given megaphones to spread their lies and hate.  Listening to some chickenshit chickenhawk squawk about honor and patriotism — two concepts completely foreign to their governing philosophy — is a tuning fork for cognitive dissonance.  I can’t help but compare them to con artists try to pass counterfeit US currency with pictures of dead serial killers instead of dead presidents. Ridiculous pronouncements from The Former Guy should be clearly labeled as bullshit.  The chyron running under interviews with people like Kayleigh McEnany Devin Nunes Louie Gohmert Mitch McConnell or any of the rest of the usual suspects should read “THIS PERSON IS LYING” in flashing letters so no one misses the warning. Even though he’s clearly toast one of the Orange Gasbag’s lawyers is bleating that his client is not going to be indicted in the currently imminent indictment of the tRump1 Organization.  This is not news.  We already knew that TFG wasn’t going to be named in the first set of indictments.  Yet parts of the media are trying to sell this as if it means Jabba the Gut2 is going to walk away unscathed. I’m fairly certain Rachel Maddow could spend 16 hours a day in 5 minute segments exposing blatant republican corruption and not repeat herself once between now and the end of the year.  There really is enough republican corruption to go around.  All or our serious journalists (and pretend journalists) should be covering this stuff.  When the focus on the Mr. Potato Head manufactured controversy escaped from the propaganda machine and spread across the rest of our media landscape we were deprived of real news coverage while talking heads blathered about insipid nonsense. We don’t have to take it.  Vote with your eyeballs.  If the media are going to insist on putting a criminal cabal who only care about themselves on the same plane as people who are trying their damnedest to make this country a better place for everyone.  Is you see bothsiderism false equivalences or lies presented as truth look for other sources for your news and let that source know you are leaving.  If you see Fox being played in a waiting room ask to have the channel changed.  Call out propaganda.  We can make a difference. A large part of Dick a L’Orange2 the Man for All Treasons2’ support would evaporate if they weren’t fed a constant diet of lies about their erstwhile savior Little Caught Red-Handed2.  Donald is no longer relevant.  He is yesterday’s news.  What he says no longer matters (the only reason it ever mattered was because of the office and not the man).  The sooner that point is driven home to his base the faster we can accelerate our work at repairing the damage. 1The ‘t’ is silent. 2h/t Stephen Colbert’s HeWhoShallBeNamed hashtag Stray thought:  All proceeds collected by the Congressional Republican Widows and Orphans fund are actually spent on throat lozenges for Gym Jordan.  All that yelling takes a toll. Up the Resistance (we continue to resist the ongoing depredations of the Reichwing) In case you missed it Stephen Colbert has saved you the trouble of watching the whole thing by reviewing The Former Guy’s rally in Ohio.  If you are still in need of video insights John Oliver went after Health Care Sharing Ministries on Last Week Tonight this week. Moving on — Hark! What news through yonder media conglomerate breaks? Is that a Spine I See Over There in (R) Country? It looks like you can count the number of republican senators with spines on the fingers of one finger.  The rest of them don’t have a single vertebrae to share between their entire worm farm. DailyBeast:  Justin Baragona:  Mitt Romney Snarks at Trump Pushing the Big Lie: ‘This Is Like WWF...It’s Not Real’ Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) blasted former President Donald Trump for continuing to peddle the big lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen likening the ex-president’s rhetoric to professional wrestling while noting that nothing Trump says is “real.” ...The senator reiterated that the “election is over” and “it was fair” adding that Trump was already “crying foul” about the results before Election Night. “The question is what were his sources of information?” Romney rhetorically asked. “Where did he hear that the election had been fraudulently carried out? Did he hear it from the Justice Department? No. Did he hear it from the intelligence community? No.” Clang! Clang! Goes the Cell Door This one might turn into a case of “the family that perjures together throws each other under the bus together.”  While involuntarily lying with every breath they take is a clear component of the family DNA  there are serious consequences when they do it under oath.  In order to avoid possible jail time we are likely to see some of the spawn become more cooperative with prosecutors. Mother Jones:  David Corn:  Documents Show Ivanka Trump Didn’t Testify Accurately in Inauguration Scandal Case The Trump family has trouble with depositions. In 2007 testimony Donald Trump was repeatedly shown to be a liar. In February Donald Trump Jr. was deposed in the Trump inauguration scandal lawsuit and on several key points under oath he provided false testimony. A review of documents filed in that case and other material obtained by Mother Jones shows that Ivanka Trump also testified inaccurately during her deposition in this lawsuit. The inauguration probe was launched last year by Karl Racine the attorney general of Washington DC. He has alleged that Trump’s inauguration committee misused charitable funds to enrich the Trump family. As Racine put it the lawsuit maintains “that the Inaugural Committee a nonprofit corporation coordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel… The Committee also improperly used non-profit funds to throw a private party [at the Trump Hotel] for the Trump family costing several hundred thousand dollars.” In short the attorney general accused the Trump gang of major grifting and he is seeking to recover the money paid to the Trump Hotel so those funds can be used for real charitable purposes. During a December 1 deposition—in which she swore to tell the truth—Ivanka Trump the eldest daughter of Donald Trump who was an executive at the Trump Organization before becoming a White House adviser to her father was asked if she had any “involvement in the process of planning the inauguration.” She replied “I really didn’t have an involvement.” Ivanka testified that if her “opinion was solicited” regarding an inauguration event she “would give feedback to my father or to anyone who asked my perspective or opinion.” And that was as far as her participation went. But this wasn’t accurate according to the documents which indicate she was part of the decision-making for various aspects of the inauguration including even the menus for events. More from the Fraudit Follies Republicans are giving a master class in how to further discredit their already discredited fraudit.  Arizona’s insane republican senators are in desperate need of heavy medication if they think this fiasco is going to serve any purpose other than making them look like the idiots they so clearly are.  Huffington Post:  Mary Papenfuss:  Cyber Ninjas CEO Running Arizona Recount Is Mystery Voice On New QAnon Film The CEO of the Cyber Ninjas firm running the Arizona GOP’s sham election audit is the mystery voice in a twisted new election conspiracy film. Doug Logan whose private company is in charge of an ongoing audit of 2.1 million votes in Maricopa County (including Phoenix) is the altered voice of the shadowy entity “Anon” who calls for “election integrity” in the film “Deep Rig” organizers revealed at a showing over the weekend. The movie spouts baseless conspiracy theories and QAnon talking points that the presidential election was rigged. “Just think about that for a minute” Arizona Republic columnist Laurie Roberts wrote Sunday. “The man in charge of auditing Maricopa County’s election ... is now appearing in a film chock full of conspiracy theories backed up by nothing more than QAnon crazies and wishful thinking.” There Aren’t Any Rails Left to Jump Over in Rudyland That suspended law license isn’t the only problem swirling around Rudy.  Folks in his circle keep running into legal problems (remember Lev & Igor).  From the Ukraine to California getting involved with Rudy does not bode well for anyone looking to avoid federal scrutiny. Mother Jones:  Dan Friedman:  Rudy Giuliani’s Ukrainian Friends Keep Getting Sanctioned On June 18 Ukraine’s government slapped two of the country’s oligarchs Dmytro Firtash and Pavel Fuks with sanctions for allegedly corrupt business dealings. One thing they have in common: Rudy Giuliani. Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council accused Firtash a controversial tycoon who first got rich shipping Russian natural gas with supplying the raw materials for titanium to the Russian military which invaded Ukraine in 2014 and currently supports separatists waging war in the country’s eastern Donbas region. Fuks who amassed his fortune as a Moscow real estate developer was sanctioned for illegally obtaining oil and gas licenses via the kleptocratic and Putin-aligned regime of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Giuliani who faces a criminal investigation resulting from his 2019 effort to dig up negative information on Joe Biden in Ukraine has ties to both oligarchs. (A New York appellate court suspended Giuliani’s law license on Thursday over another matter citing “demonstrably false and misleading” statements he made in court and elsewhere about the 2020 election.) But wait there’s more. Mother Jones:  Dan Friedman & Russ Choma:  The FBI Searched the Home of a Rudy Giuliani Associate FBI agents on Tuesday searched the California home of George Dickson III a marijuana entrepreneur who last year partnered with Rudy Giuliani to line up financing for a never completed documentary aimed at advancing the former New York mayor’s bogus claims about Joe and Hunter Biden and Ukraine. Asked about a search at Dickson’s address in Aptos California a spokesperson for the FBI’s San Francisco office on Thursday said they could “confirm the FBI was present at that location on Tuesday June 22 to conduct court-authorized law enforcement activity.” The spokesperson declined to comment further “due to the ongoing nature of the investigation.” ...Dickson last year worked with Giuliani then Trump’s personal lawyer to secure investors for what they pitched as a documentary about Hunter and Joe Biden’s actions in Ukraine. One source familiar with the project said Giuliani envisioned the film as the culmination of his efforts and a possible “kill shot” to Biden’s presidential campaign. Tim Yale a California Republican operative and fundraiser with ties to Roger Stone the longtime Trump adviser and dirty trickster and to former California GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher was also involved with the film effort. Yale did not respond to phone and text messages. Faux News Stumbles and Asks a Good Question Usually Faux News can be expected to distort or deny any bit of real news to the benefit of their autocratic masters.  Mostly they don’t practice journalism — they produce propaganda.  Chris Wallace is about the only one left in their entire organization that ever gives them any credibility.  The Guardian:  Martin Pengelly:  ‘Republicans are defunding the police’: Fox News anchor stumps congressman The Fox News anchor Chris Wallace made headlines of his own on Sunday by pointing out to a senior Republican that he and the rest of his party recently voted against $350bn in funding for law enforcement. “Can’t you make the argument that it’s you and the Republicans who are defunding the police?” Wallace asked Jim Banks the head of the House Republican study committee. ...“Congressman Banks let me finish and I promise I will give you a chance to answer. The president is saying cities and states can use this money to hire more police officers invest in new technologies and develop summer job training and recreation programs for young people. Respectfully I’ve heard your point about the last year but you and every other Republican voted against this $350bn.” Remember This Jackass? If Cancun Cruz had as much sense as God gave linoleum he’d just shut up and try to keep his head down.  Instead ... Huffington Post:  Ed Mazza:  Ted Cruz’s ‘Brazen Gaslighting’ Message Backfires Spectacularly On Twitter Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Monday accused White House press secretary Jen Psaki of “brazen gaslighting.” But given his own history it didn’t go well. Cruz shared a video of Psaki saying Republicans are essentially defunding the police since they voted against the COVID relief American Rescue Plan which included $350 billion for local law enforcement agencies. How convenient for you to finally remember this word. Now do “traitor” and “coward”.  The Return of the Schittzenpantzen Files In the fertile ground of comeuppance far far beyond the fields of schadenfreude lies the realm of the Schittzenpantzen. With the start of indictment season a day or possibly just a few hours away there’s a sense of panic in the halls of Faux News.  Congressional republicans are skittering and slithering about in aimless dread of what’s to come.  Mitch McConnell has retreated into his neck wattles.  The Former Guy and his demon spawn are getting ready for a big family under-the-bus reunion. There’s even a new song celebrating the event (apologies to Dean Martin): When the shit hits the fanAnd you’re badged by the manThat’s comeuppanceWhen the world grins and smilesAt your troubles and trialsThat’s comeuppance. Each concrete revelation rips away another fig leaf from the republican party’s ability to cover their naked lust for power (and the lucre that comes with it).  If they had any socially redeeming qualities I’d almost feel sorry for them.  But they don’t and I don’t. Competing in the imminent indictment lottery were:  Rudy “I got no license” Giuliani Matt “The Molester” Gaetz The Former Guy The Former Guy’s adult road apples Matt “Squid pro quo” Calamari Alan “The Gonif” Weisselberg Roger “Il Douche” Stone and various people known only as unindicted co-conspirators. And the winner is — The tRump Organization.  Oh My.  There’ll wailing and gnashing among the shareholders employees and hangers-on tonight.  Indicting the company has some implications: There’s even been a tiny bit of media coverage and punditure on the subject. Yahoo:  Peter Weber:  Former Trump Organization executive weighs Trump's odds of avoiding indictment and jail France 24:  Threat of indictments looms large for Trump Organization Vanity Fair:  Bess Levin:  Report: The Trump Organization Has Until Today to Beg Not to Be Hit With Criminal Charges One of the most enraging things about Donald Trump is that for essentially his entire life he’s escaped any and all consequences for being what legal scholars define as a “corrupt piece of shit.” Whether it was inciting an attack on the U.S. Capitol trying to extort Ukraine allegedly directing his lawyer to break campaign finance laws lying to the public about COVID-19 or allegedly stiffing hundreds of Trump business contractors the man has somehow consistently avoided repercussions save for a few financial settlements here and there. But five months after leaving the White House that luck may be running out—and not just for Trump but for his entire family business. Salon:  Zachary Petrizzo:  Roger Stone urges Trump to dump "weak-kneed" lawyers in the face of likely indictment Raw Story:  Bob Brigham:  Indictment could be 'almost a death blow' to Trump Organization: Impeachment counsel … Goldman explained the significance of the reporting during a Friday appearance on MSNBC. "It's interesting to me — and it doesn't seem to be coming from the Manhattan DA's office — but it's interesting and not surprising they would approach the Trump Organization to tell them that they're considering to charge them because that would be almost a death blow to the Trump Organization" Goldman said. "Every single bank would call their loans if the Trump Organization is indicted. No bank will ever do business with an indicted company and there's no way the Trump Organization has enough capital to pay off all their loans. So they would be in default of their loans and would almost certainly have to go into bankruptcy" he explained. I can’t underscore enough how devastating an indictment would be to the Trump Org. Every lender would call their loans and no way Trump Org can pay them all likely leading to bankruptcy. Weisselberg may not cooperate without more serious charges but any charge will doom the TO. https://t.co/Zu9ksiVUBl Andy Borowitz for the Win I’m glad Andy is on our side.  He’s very accurate with those skewers he wields. The New Yorker:  Satire from the Borowitz Report:  Mitch McConnell Warns That Voting Bill Would Bring U.S. to Brink of Democracy WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Blasting the For the People Act Senator Mitch McConnell claimed that the bill’s passage would bring the United States “to the brink of democracy.” “The Democrats can dress this bill up any way they want but their real agenda couldn’t be clearer” the Senate Minority Leader said. “They want to turn the United States of America that we love and cherish into a democracy.” Beating Up on the Big “C” As long as we aren’t red-hatted neanderthal medicine deniers the almost daily advances we see in the areas of prevention detection and treatment should go a long way to lessening our overall anxiety levels. Good News Network:  Andy Corbley:  Simple Blood Test That Can Detect 50 Types of Cancer is Accurate Enough to Be Rolled Out Whereas a cancer screening requires making an individual appointment with a physician this simple blood test can screen for 50 separate cancers and detect them at an above-average rate. Aimed at individuals who are 50+ the ease and thoroughness of the test process can help detect difficult-to-diagnose cancers when they’re in their early stages such as some blood cancers ovarian head and neck and pancreatic cancer. Developed by a U.S. biotech company called Grail the trials of around 3000 people looked for small leaks of altered DNA that seep from tumors into the bloodstream.

Today:  Yankees fan will be bat girl 60 years after being told girls don't belong in dugout It’s a field of dreams come true. On Monday Gwen McLoughlin 70 will serve as bat girl for the New York Yankees when they play the Los Angeles Angels 60 years after she was rejected when she wrote a letter to the team as a 10-year-old girl asking if she could serve in the role. In 1961 McLoughlin then Gwen Goldman received a response from Roy Hamey who was general manager of the team. Bob Dylan first recorded this in 1973 but I’ve always preferred Joan Baez’s cover version from 1976.  The second verse (bolded) has been resonating with me these last several years.

Take it away WineRev >>>>>Bad News for Fossil Fuels is Good News for the Planet. Wyoming and Idaho have a lot of coal which companies mine to pollute the air. These 2 states are lightly populated so they can hardly use any of it so the way to make money on it is to export the stuff to some of THOSE COUNTRIES who will pollute their air…..out of sight out of mind. Well the 2 states and their corporate overlords want to build a huge coal loading dock system on the Pacific coast at the end of a rail line to export the stuff. That would be Washington state who in many and various ways has told the land-locked Wyoming and Idaho “Nothing doing.” So naturally their corporate overlords made those 2 states (!) sue Washington state to help them pollute. Well states suing states are a fairly rare thing and guess who has jurisdiction over these suits? The Supreme Court. And yesterday the Supremes RULED the suit could not go forward. “Take your coal and leave it in the ground.” Fossil fuel people are having a sad but the rest of the planet is literally breathing easier. June 29ths that know this day is just great for a full bathroom remodel (like here at WineRev Manor where your author is house- and cat- sitting for my sweetie SageHagRN) which is already a Goofy thing but they finish today which will be a Good thing so here’s hoping your Good and Goofy moments today don’t mean changing floors to use the plumbing at 3 in the morning but are light hearted and thoughtful.               1738   Jettenhofen Germany   Birth of Constantin Reindl  composer. Although German-born he spent much of his life in neighboring Switzerland. Grew up in a devoutly Catholic household and eventually became a Jesuit priest mostly serving in the area in and around Lucerne. Found time and had the ear to compose and loved music well enough and with enough talent he eventually became the city music director (and as a priest. Even then a fairly odd combination.) Several Masses and solemn oratorios as might be expected yet somewhere inside was a much lighter side. Wrote a couple dozen cantatas and other vocal works that have a decidedly sunny flavor to them (“The Village Schoolmaster” “The Village Shepherd.”) Also best recalled for some sinfonias and violin concertos some comic operas and light operettas. Obviously a rather popular priest with that sort of output.                1897  San Francisco   Birth of Kazue Togasaki physician. Kazue’s family (of 9 children) were Japanese immigrants; her father was a merchant and her mother was from a family of merchants. While Kazue was 2nd born she set the tone for her siblings. Kazue graduated from Stanford in 1920 then after many application tries was accepted at Women’s Medical College of PA becoming one of the first Asian women to receive a medical degree. (Inspiring her siblings? 2 other sisters became MDs another became a psychiatrist with the VA and two more sisters became RNs.) After graduating with honors she had trouble getting established due to broad prejudice against Asian-Americans as well as disapproval from other Japanese and Asians who disapproved of women practicing medicine. In a major karmic reversal the interning of Japanese-Americans in camps proved her opportunity: she was a godsend in the camps providing medical care and delivering dozens of babies. After the war she was considered a hero and an icon in the Asian community and practiced medicine until the mid-1970s.              1905    New York City  (Sweet baseball #1) The Giants are playing a home game today and have a big lead. Time to see what the kid can do so they send in the rookie as a later-in-the-game substitute. Archibald (later “Moonlight”) Graham fulfills a boyhood dream grabs his glove and heads into right field. Things are quiet both innings he’s out there not a ball hit his way but now Giants are up to bat. Archie is on deck….but the batter ahead of him makes the 3rd out so he never gets to the plate then or ever. It was Graham’s only professional game.  Recognizing reality Graham (a smart guy) goes back to school (playing varsity baseball and football) and 3 years later gets his medical degree from the University of Maryland. He becomes a family doctor in Chisholm Minnesota (on the Iron Range) and provides medical care and free eyeglasses for children for 50 years. His “career” is forgotten…..until W.P. Kinsella came across his story and wrote him into his 1982 novel……which Philip Robinson wrote into a screenplay and then directed as a 1989 movie. In “Field of Dreams” Archie finally got his turn at bat…..and saved a little girl’s life….               1922    Vimy Ridge France  During World War I Britain called upon her Empire for manpower. Canada answered and regiments came from Quebec. The relation between these soldiers and civilians was warm (as both found the other’s form of French fascinating and endearing.)  The Canadians spent much of the war on Vimy Ridge fighting both in defense and offense suffering and dying for their new civilian friends and the civilians were deeply grateful. A few years after the war on this day France shows her gratitude in a deep yet charming way: she grants 1 km² at Vimy Ridge "freely and for all time to the Government of Canada the free use of the land exempt from all taxes." Vive la France!  (I wonder if there’s a Mountie walking post in full dress reds…...would also make for an interesting plot twist in a legal thriller as the heroine from say Calgary during a deadly chase through northern France steps onto Canadian soil to stymie a villain….)               1937  Valcourt Quebec Canada   30 year old Joseph-Armand Bombardier had been an inventive lad: at age 15 he strapped a Ford Model T engine between two wooden sleds mounted a long wooden propeller on the shaft and started it up. The propeller paddled and moved the sleds engine and Joseph through the snow. His father made him dismantle it because of the danger of the propeller. He was sent to seminary but dropped out after a year and spent 2 years in Montreal studying mechanical engineering. He then married and moved back to Valcourt with his wife. In 1934 his 2-year-old son developed peritonitis and died because in winter there was no way to transport him to a hospital on unplowed rural roads. Bombardier went back to tinkering and on this day received a patent for his “snowmobile” (une autoneige). It was a 7-passenger thing with an enclosed cabin running on caterpillar tracks and became widely popular in rural areas as an all-weather school bus and was adapted for use by the Canadian military and also the Mounties. The Bombardier Company later invented and patented smaller lighter open snowmobile models (like you know today) and since the late 1960s has had international success in designing and selling private jets as well as commercial regional models for passengers between mid-sized markets.             1956     Washington DC Back in 1919 Dwight Eisenhower (already in the Army as a junior officer) was part of an Army cross-country convoy to investigate how motorized vehicles could help Army logistics in the US. The report was awful because the roads were so bad and so badly marked. In the 1930s the state of Pennsylvania built a cross-state turnpike with limited access and multiple lanes. A few years later the Germans used Pennsylvania’s ideas to build autobahns (with ramps for left turns!) and make road transportation equal to rail for military movement. Now on this day President Eisenhower signs the US Federal Defense Highway Act. It authorized 42500 miles of 4 lane interstate highways linking major cities….for defense purposes (why all the markers are in the shape of a shield.) Since these were for national defense a national responsibility the federal government would pay 90% of the cost with states and localities kicking in the remaining 10%. Politicians rushed to sign up for a 9 to 1 funding match.               1974      Toronto Canada    The ballet is in town and not just any ballet: the Kirov Ballet with their headliner superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov.  During the Cold War there were these “cultural exchanges” of the artistic sort between West and East but the Soviets were always nervous. Not for reasons of art (they were confident about that) but because of politics. Today a nightmare came true for the USSR: Baryshnikov goes “over the wall”; he defects and asks for asylum in Canada. (Granted.) It was a nasty blow to Soviet prestige (always a good thing among us East European types) so even if we weren’t ballet fans we cheered heartily anyway….and then we learned to become ballet fans….WOW that man can dance! (even alongside Gregory Hines in “White Nights”….)             1975   Cupertino California   Steve Wozniak the OTHER Steve and partner at Apple Computer on this day tests his first working prototype of the Apple I Computer. GUI interfaces and Motorola CPU chips yet to come…..              1990   Toronto Canada AND Los Angeles  (Sweet baseball #2. Some history in YOUR lifetime!) Since the formation of the American League in 1901 until 2021 there have been thousands of major league baseball games. In all those thousands only 269 times has a pitcher been strong enough clever enough and lucky enough to throw a no-hitter: all strikeouts fly ball outs and grounders relayed to first base IN TIME! Maybe if you’re really good and have a lucky night you might just might throw one ONCE in your career. Today was one for the books: in Toronto the visiting Oakland A's Dave Stewart pitches a no-hitter against the Blue Jays. A few hours later in front of the breath-holding and then wildly cheering hometown fans the Dodger’s Fernando Valenzuela no-hits the St Louis Cardinals the 1st time (and still the only time) for two no-hitters on the same day and one in each league.
