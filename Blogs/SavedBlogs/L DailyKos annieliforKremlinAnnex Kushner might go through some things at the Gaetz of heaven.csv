L, Kushner might "go through some things" at the Gaetz of heaven, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-05-01, Roger Stone Says He Took ‘Not a Dime’ From Anyone Seeking Trump Pardon but that may not have anything to do with @ProjectLincoln buzzing about something happening on Monday.  This story is remarkable and perplexing on so many levels but the one tidbit that perfectly encapsulates the Trump admin is that Stone believes Greenberg’s pardon request was hindered because Gaetz didn’t push for it even though Gaetz was implicated in the conduct. https://t.co/jVSuS3Lh1w  There is some reason for Joel Greenberg to have specified exactly what he wanted to be pardoned for. There was talk about Trump issuing “blanket pardons” for his allies absolving them of guilt in broadly specified topic areas rather than for more specific crimes. Gerald Ford issued such a pardon for Richard Nixon for example as did George H.W. Bush for figures in the Iran-contra affair. The New York Times has also reported that Gaetz sought a blanket pardon in Trump’s final weeks in office. But the breadth of those pardons was strongly criticized and blanket pardons are very rare. Even if you accept that Greenberg needed to say what he wanted to be pardoned for though his purported letter went beyond that in two key ways: First it actually confessed and second it implicated Gaetz. www.washingtonpost.com/...   EXCLUSIVE: The Daily Beast has obtained a confession letter that Joel Greenberg wrote while working with Roger Stone to obtain a pardon… and it directly implicates Matt Gaetz https://t.co/hJNkkmnudq  Stay tuned. #AbeKnowsAll pic.twitter.com/rzj4Ag2Tnc
