L, Just Sayn': In my inoculated oasis my Asian figurine celebrates by getting a new look, HalBrown, 2021-04-20, I live in a senior community with about 500 residents where we will soon reach a 100% post-two week inoculation rate. I’ve called our 23 areas an island of the immunized or an inoculated oasis. My patio is on a path which is a shortcut used by some residents on the street where I live in a duplex which leads to some of the residential apartment buildings.  Through the pandemic I had a mask on my Asian man figurine (shown below with my Westies Mac and Duff). I had him holding a glass bulb meant to represent a crystal ball looking into a hopeful future. Later in the year I double taped an unpainted carved wooden bird awkwardly on his head. Over the past week I decided that I’d have him celebrate our campus being fully inoculated. I embellished him in increments. I spray painted the beads on his necklace because they had lost their color. In several steps I painted the bird so it was colorful but it was set askew on his head with double tape so I decide to do a little brain surgery. I clipped the head off a small nail and drilled a hole in the head but it went all the way through so the nail slid inside. I then drilled a smaller hole about ¼ deep and a hole in the bottom of the bird. I was then able to attach the bird with the nail it so it perched perfectly. Another photo of the painted bird. The CDC has drastically loosened their recommendations for masks wearing based on people being two weeks past their final vaccination. We live in an enclave where all our residents are or soon will be safely past the two week mark. Instead of holding the glass globe he has a bowl filled with water reminding people who walk by that they can now eat with their friends outside. It remains to be seen whether real birds will drink out of it.  ------ Addendum. Unfortunately my county just moved to a higher risk level. Their mask guidance doesn’t recognize that within the county there are facilities like mine which have adhered to strict Covid prevention practices throughout the pandemic. They have not allowed visitors. Contractors weren’t allowed inside except in emergencies. What makes sense for the large community doesn’t always make sense for the small communities within it.
