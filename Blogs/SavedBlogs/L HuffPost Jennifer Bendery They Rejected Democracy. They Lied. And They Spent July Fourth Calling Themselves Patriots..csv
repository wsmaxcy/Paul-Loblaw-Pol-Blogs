L, They Rejected Democracy. They Lied. And They Spent July Fourth Calling Themselves Patriots., Jennifer Bendery, 2021-07-07, Tuesday marked six months since two of the most horrific attacks on American democracy happened in plain sight. The first was when a mob incited by the president of the United States stormed the U.S. Capitol with plans to kill the speaker of the House the vice president and other elected officials to stop them from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral win. They smashed and stole federal property. They sent hundreds of lawmakers into hiding. They injured more than 400 police officers. Three officers later died and the death toll could have been so much worse. The second occurred just hours later when 147 Republican lawmakers came out of their hiding places and voted to overturn the presidential election ― based on the same lie about widespread voter fraud that fueled the Capitol attack in the first place. Those 147 Republicans are hoping you’ll forget that they lied to the American public and threatened the peaceful transfer of power that day. HuffPost reviewed all of their social media accounts and found that over the July Fourth holiday weekend virtually all of them boasted about their love for the U.S. casting themselves as patriots as if the Jan. 6 insurrection ― and their role in it ― never happened. For the sake of posterity if nothing else here are the names of all 147 of those Senate and House Republicans alongside their Independence Day messages celebrating American democracy and freedom. Amid the countless images of flags and fireworks and references to the Constitution not a one mentioned that they voted to reject a democratically elected president and spread a deadly lie to justify doing so. In the Senate: 1. Ted Cruz (Texas) ― “I’m proud to be an American.” I’m proud to be an American and I’m proud to be free.That’s why I will continue to fight each and every day to protect our God-given liberties.#HappyIndependenceDay pic.twitter.com/r29dpiQVpJ 2.
