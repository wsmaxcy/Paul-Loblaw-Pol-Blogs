L, Newsom and Novelty: Caitlyn Jenner joins in the recall effort, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-04-23, GOP consultant Tim Miller weighs in on the Newsom recall effort in California. Let me cut to the chase: Any person who supported Donald Trump has failed the entry-level test of political viability for statewide office in California. End of story. I had some folks push back on this notion on Twitter citing The Governator’s recall victory in 2003. This might make sense from afar but doesn’t take into account the changes which have happened in American politics over the last 20 years. The same demographic changes in the country and the suburban shift towards Democrats that helped the party improve in places like Atlanta are also operative in San Diego Los Angeles Sacramento and even the Bay Area. Let me lay out some numbers for you to demonstrate how different of a world we are in today from that of 2003. In the two presidential races bookending the 2003 recall George W. Bush lost California by 1.3 million and 1.2 million votes respectively. Not exactly close. But get this: Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 5.1 million votes. For a sense of scale here the gap between Biden and Trump was greater than the entire raw vote total Bush got in California in 2000. And it’s not just Trump. Gavin Newsom won his race by 3 million votes and just under 24 percentage points in 2018. Back in 2002 Gray Davis won his race by just 400000 votes and 5 percentage points. morningshots.thebulwark.com/... I’m in! California is worth fighting for.

Gavin Newsom in a recall election hoping her celebrity status and name recognition can yield an upset in the nation's most populous state. She's assembled a team of prominent GOP operatives including Tony Fabrizio the top pollster on Donald Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns Ryan Erwin founder of RedRock Strategies and Tyler Deaton president of Allegiance Strategies. www.axios.com/... Caitlyn Jenner has no real support. I don't care about her candidacy. I do care about the ways in which her asinine views will be weaponized against trans people and the ways in which transphobia will go unchecked.This is purely a vanity campaign and it's incredibly selfish.  Appropriate response: Caitlyn Jenner is a deeply unqualified hack who doesn't care about anyone but herself. Her views are terrible. She is a horrible candidate.Inappropriate response: [Misgendering Caitlyn Jenner because you think transphobia is okay here. It's not.]
