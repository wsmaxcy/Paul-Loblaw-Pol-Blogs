L, What is going on with the Pentagon Internet>, kittylou, 2021-04-25, I am completely hopeless at any sort of tech savvy but I saw this article and it seems that this is not a good thing! My limited understanding is telling me that the Pentagon sold a huge amount of internet property to a company that “magically” appeared literally moments before Biden was office and now controls ip addresses and Pentagon space on the internet? Can anyone with more knowledge than this techno illiterate help enlighten? apnews.com/...
