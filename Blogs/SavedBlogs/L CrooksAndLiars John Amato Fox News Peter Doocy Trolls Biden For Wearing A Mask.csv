L, Fox News' Peter Doocy Trolls Biden For Wearing A Mask, John Amato, 2021-05-18, In an effort to continue to sow confusion and disinformation over CDC guidelines on wearing masks Fox News' White House correspondent Peter Doocy took aim at President Biden. On America Reports Co-host Sandra Smith opens up the segment by saying businesses across the country are coming to grips with the new CDC guidelines wondering what the White House was saying about all of this.  Peter Doocy a chip off his father's block reported "Nothing directly yet today Sandra but the president is saying a lot by showing us what he's wearing." "We have some new video you can see at a electric vehicle plant in Dearborn Michigan" he continued. "He has got a face mask covering his mouth and nose which conflicts with CDC guidance that says you don't have to do that or socially distance indoors or outdoors as long as you are vaccinated." There is no CDC guideline prohibiting mask-wearing anywhere and Pres. Biden is setting an example of safety first.  Many companies in this country are still requiring employees and anyone visiting to wear masks indoors. But to the Fox News trolls wearing a mask is confusing and unwanted. FoxQ and all the rest of the conservative media have nothing so they make up fake controversies to keep their viewers angry. Protecting yourself against a virus isn't a controversy at all but since the Biden administration has done an incredible job getting vaccines to the American people Fox News anchors and reporters have to create misinformation to fill their time slots. Twitter had thoughts too: I think one of the reasons Peter Doocy comes up with this dumbass nonsense is because his head is so narrow there isn’t enough room for a decent brain. — Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) May 18 2021 FOX is the sarin gas of broadcasting. — dmk (@sixmile) May 18 2021 They should have to wear buttons that say “Thank you for forgetting when our boss told you to shine black light up your butts." — Jim Snowden (@SnowdenJim) May 18 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
