L, Pfizer Vaccine Likely Will Be Approved for 12-15 Year Olds Next Week, mastergardener2k, 2021-05-03, News reports are circulating that the FDA will likely approved Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for adolescents between 12 to 15 years old either late this week or early next week. www.nytimes.com/… The news is highly anticipated: Eager parents have been counting down the weeks since Pfizer announced results from its trial in adolescents showing the vaccine is at least as effective in that age group as it is in adults. Vaccinating children is also key to raising the level of immunity in the population and bringing down the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. Although young people seldom experience severe Covid they can spread the virus to vulnerable people and provide a host for new variants that may be more deadly. It should make school openings more likely.  In any event having more of the population immune is a major positive. Vaccinations have slowed to 2.3 million a day in the US. As of Sunday 44.4% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 56.3% of adults in the US have had one or two injections and 82.8% of senior Americans have received at least one jab.
