L, Happy Fourth of July Patriots! Let's Celebrate! ☼ 2 Polls: Bill's + Your Fourth ☼ Sunday Good News, 2thanksforGood News, 2021-07-04, Good News: We bring it we make it.  The Good Gnus group is a community of readers writers activists supporters community builders and patriots. We begin gathering every day at 7 a.m. ET to celebrate national good news. Our most active members are of course a subgroup of members of Daily Kos whose Front Pages celebrate “News Community Action.” However you don’t have to be a member of Daily Kos to be a Gnusie. We are realists not fools idiots or ostriches. We seek the truth. We know we live in a world where active nefarious and evil decision-makers do very bad things and create stress and anxiety in us our loved ones our friends our neighbors and our allies and destroy people and systems we hold dear. However we choose to focus on the good news that people create around the country. Sometimes we ourselves create Good News. Together we are strong and resilient. We return regularly to these pages to revitalize. In a Good News Roundup the weight of bearing good news is not borne by the author alone: Gnusies can be counted on to adorn the comment section with good news. Often commenters create three times as many comments as Recommendations! If you cannot linger with us for hours I recommend you return in the mid or late afternoon learn who your favorite commenters are and Find their names on return visits. We count on certain favorite Gnusies to bless us in the comments with humor hope history and analysis every day. We bring good news and we create good news.   We have a lot to celebrate this year. We have not arrived at the end of our Resistance road but definitely we are allowed to look back at the past weeks months years presidencies and see and celebrate the good things we’ve created.  We cordially invite everybody to the KOS Art Expo that will be published later today here at Daily Kos at 2 p.m. ET. There you will find the talents of many of your Kosack friends explode like fireworks in a Museum of the Beautiful and the Curious. For example here is a painting by Ralphdog from a previous Expo.  Image: Painting of a country road stretching into the distance by Kosack Ralphdog. I got an early-bird view of today’s Expo and I saw works by familiar Gnusies and well-known Kosacks such as RedWoodMan (RIP) Starhawk (who drew this diary’s top image) Stude Dude marsanges gizmo59 Marko the Werelynx and Cmae. Find today's Expo on the Front Page Trending List (hopefully maybe) and definitely here the Expo archive.     Gnusie Bill in Portland Maine lets me repeat the results of his research. He arrayed the following items in his popular Who Won the Week? poll in Friday’s Cheers and Jeers. Many people already voted in that poll.

Recent findings may be troubling. However they give us hope because they show us how to fix things. 100 years ago we had the Roaring 20s. As Gnusies we do not hide our eyes we are truth-seeking commensals sharing a table. Once again I lift Daily Kos’s Magnifico:  Overnight News Digest: “We still have time to act and salvage many of the things we care about”   Our map of Gnuville: Over 640 of us have shared our global locations!
