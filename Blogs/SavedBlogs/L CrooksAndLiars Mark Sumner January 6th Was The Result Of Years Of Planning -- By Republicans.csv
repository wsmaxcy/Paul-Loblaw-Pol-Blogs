L, January 6th Was The Result Of Years Of Planning -- By Republicans, Mark Sumner, 2021-05-25, In the shadow of Jan. 6 every interview with a Republican official has become an exercise in futility. Some like Sen. Ron Johnson are  straightforward in endorsing lies about election fraud in the face of  not just no evidence but mountains of contrary evidence. Others like  every single other Republican senator and 90% of Republicans in the  House tiptoes along a pretense of accepting the outcome of the  election but still pretending that there’s something “right” about  continuing to support the exact same conspiracy theories that led to  camo-wearing insurgents smearing excrement through the halls of  Congress.    Attempts to pin down any of these Republicans can be entertaining for  the levels and techniques of question-dodging on display. But they’re  also infuriating. Because:   The Big Lie is something Republicans have been building for years.  2020 wasn’t the start of this cycle. Donald Trump rode into the 2016  campaign already declaring that any outcome that didn’t see him  victorious would be the result of fraud. He spent every day of his time  inside the White House polishing that election fraud turd and promoting  conspiracy theories—any conspiracy theory would do—precisely so he could  level the same charges in 2020.    The difference in the Big Lie 2020 wasn’t the lie and it wasn’t  Trump. It was how he got everyone else in the GOP to play along. Trump spent months of the campaign claiming that “people how have been dead 10 years are still voting.” That “millions of illegal  immigrants are voting.” That “voter fraud is very very common.” That wasn’t the 2020 campaign. That was Trump in 2016.   As FactCheck.org noted  at the time Trump spent weeks telling his supporters that the election  was rigged. He urged his followers to “monitor the polls” and to “watch  other communities.” In other words Trump sent his red-hatted thugs  into Black neighborhoods in an attempt to intimidate voters because he  said “we don’t want this election stolen from us.”  ‘The first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly.’   Voter fraud wasn’t an add-on to Trump’s campaign. It was a core  claim. Just weeks after riding down that golden escalator Trump claimed  that some voters were voting over and over again with some of them  voting “about like 10 times.” Trump was backed up by members of his  campaign such as Roger Stone. And in August 2020 Stone gave the  definitive statement that would shape the future of the Republican  Party.    “I think we have widespread voter fraud but the first thing that  Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly” said Stone. “If  there’s voter fraud this election will be illegitimate the election  of the winner will be illegitimate we will have a constitutional  crisis widespread civil disobedience and the government will no longer  be the government.”   That was the coup Trump and Stone were preparing to launch in 2016  only Trump surprised them both by winning. Still Trump’s team  understood that keeping up the myth of voter fraud was essential to  their future plans those plans being to discredit any authority except  their authority. Even on Election Day 2016 Trump told Fox News that the  election had been “rigged” and that there would be “large-scale fraud.”   As Hunter covered  on Daily Kos even after he won that election Trump didn’t stop trying  to convince his followers that democracy could not be trusted. The  polls were barely closed when Trump claimed that there was “serious  voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California.” As might be  expected he offered no proof for any of these chosen-from-a-hat states.   But it was only part of a larger claim that Trump made repeatedly:  So many people had voted illegally said Trump that the results  showing Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote were incorrect. “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally” said Trump.    It was a claim that like the exaggeration of the small crowd  at his inauguration was easy to laugh off as just another example of  Trump’s thin skin and expansive ego. It wasn’t. It was a continuation of  a key strategy going forward.   By the time Republicans reached the 2020 election they had literally  failed to come up with an official platform. But that didn’t mean they  didn’t have an unofficial one: using claims of voter fraud to end  effective democracy. That was the plan. It still is. Then as soon as he was in the White House Trump launched a “voter fraud commission” theoretically chaired by Mike Pence but starring the  performance art of former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Why  Kobach? Because as the Brennan Center wrote  at the time Kobach was already “one of the nation’s leading promoters  of the myth of voter fraud and laws restricting access to voting.”    Kobach wasn’t alone. The plan to discredit American elections was  also being pushed by such conservative organizations as the Heritage  Foundation and the Public Interest Legal Foundation. Both groups had  been pushing voter ID laws for years. Those laws like the 300+  “election security” bills now pending across the nation had twin  purposes: First they suppressed Democratic votes and in particular  made things harder on people of color. Second they promoted the false  idea that voter fraud was a significant problem.  ‘Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud ...’   By the time Trump came along Republicans had been thoroughly steeped  in voter fraud mythology. That gave state legislatures the support they  needed to cut off Black voters in the near term … and laid the  groundwork for the long-term strategy.   Unlike the 9/11 commission or the Jan. 6 commission now being stalled  by Republicans in the Senate Trump’s commission wasn’t in any sense  bipartisan. In theory it had some Democratic members but in practice  they had no authority. They couldn’t ask for a subpoena and couldn’t  contribute to a commission statement. In practice Kobach ran the show  mostly without bothering with the pretense of holding commission  meetings.   A year later Trump quietly disbanded his voter fraud commission having  produced exactly no evidence of something that doesn’t exist. But in a  strategy that’s entirely conspiracy-theory based a lack of evidence  isn’t a problem—it’s an opportunity.    As the commission was closed down after having found nothing the Trump White House sent out an announcement saying: “Despite  substantial evidence of voter fraud many states have refused to  provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with  basic information relevant to its inquiry.” Rather than provide any of  that evidence or even naming the states the statement from Trump said  that he was dissolving the commission to avoid “endless  legal battles at taxpayer expense.” Apparently if there were millions  of fraudulent votes it wasn’t worth trying to fix it.   In actuality Trump’s commission had not even bothered to hold a  meeting for months and had found nothing even worth further  investigation. It didn’t matter. Finding no evidence was the best  possible outcome. Actual issues can be fixed. Finding nothing only  allowed Trump—and other Republicans—to argue that there was even more  need for laws that suppressed votes.    And of course Trump made certain that the outcome of the commission  was a decreased belief in election integrity. Which was the whole  point.   Kobach would go back to Kansas where he would make differential rulings to  support Republican candidates act as the auditor of his own failed  campaign and—in another foreshadowing of 2020—launch a whole series of  lawsuits claiming massive voter fraud. All of which lost in court.   But losing in court doesn’t matter. In a conspiracy economy losing  in court—like failing to find fraud in a commission—only provides more  of what keeps such a system burning: enemies. Rolling into the 2020 election Donald Trump had purposely allowed over 300000 Americans to die because he thought it would benefit him politically. It was easy to see the day to day buffoonery and to groan over the  false claims misleading statements and flat-out lies. It was a bit  harder to realize that Trump had deliberately halted plans for a  national testing and case management system specifically because he  believed deaths would fall mostly in blue states not only decreasing  their voter rolls but generating problems for Democratic officials. So  he made deliberate mistakes allowing deliberate deaths for a very  deliberate purpose.   But even in the midst of the pandemic Trump didn’t drop his core  theme. He couldn’t. After all the contention that democracy is  failing is the only leverage Republicans have to execute their  preemptive strike on democracy. For a party with a whole platform  consisting of staying in power no matter the cost everything that  interferes with the execution of the democratic process is a good thing.  ‘This highly effective disinformation campaign … was an elite-driven mass-media led process.’   Still if the pandemic didn’t change the strategy it did have an  effect on the tactics. With an eye toward the effects of COVID-19 on  voting Republicans went all in on attacking voting by mail. Over a  month before the election Harvard published  a detailed study showing how Republicans at all levels along with  right-wing media and conservative institutions had worked together to  build on a theme that voting by mail was inherently open to fraud.   That study noted how effective the Republican strategy had been in  convincing their own voters. Half of all Republicans believed that  “election fraud is a major concern associated with expanded mail-in  voting during the pandemic.”   That belief was fostered by what researchers described as a  “disinformation campaign” that led to widespread acceptance of a false  belief. What the study showed was that contrary to the way it was being  reported in much of the traditional media disinformation wasn’t  bubbling up from social media. Instead a consistent message was being  spread through highly standard channels with the center of that network  being Trump’s campaign and Fox News—which were often highly coordinated  in spreading the same message and working together to amplify  unsupported claims.   In fact the study showed that just by repeating Trump’s false  claims other media was actually helping the lies to spread rather than  restoring faith in the system. “Our findings here suggest that Donald  Trump has perfected the art of harnessing mass media to disseminate and  at times reinforce his disinformation campaign by using three core  standard practices of professional journalism. These three are: elite  institutional focus (if the President says it it’s news); headline  seeking (if it bleeds it leads); and balance neutrality or the  avoidance of the appearance of taking a side.”   Trump saw that he only had to make the claim and it would get  covered. Fox News could hype everything he said and reinforce lies. But  the people who were supposed to be shooting down those lies often spent  more time helping to spread them. Suppressing Black votes and eroding confidence in the election process are fine strategies on the large scale. Casting suspicion on  mail-in ballots provided a more specific target. But to really sell the  idea that the election was being stolen Trump had to feed the system with a narrative with details that provided the big picture with some color some punch.   Researcher Kate Starbird has  produced a series of detailed posts and information graphics showing  how Trump was able to employ what she’s termed “participatory  disinformation.” Just as in the Q-conspiracy where believers feel a  sense of accomplishment and superiority when some guess idea or  outright quackery of their own becomes incorporated into the overall  scheme of the great cloud kraken land Trump and his supporters were  able to make voter fraud a sport where the most outrageous claims were  given the attention they needed—from supposedly reliable sources—to make  them key components of the voter fraud narrative.  ‘1000+ mail-in-ballots found in a dumpster.’   For example claims that China would “flood America with fake ballots” were floated by Trump supporters picked up by Trump  repeated endlessly in the media and are even now driving “auditors” in  Maricopa County Arizona to examine ballots for “bamboo fibers.” That  idea didn’t come out of nowhere. Trump was pushing it more than a year  ago and seven months before the election.   In September 2020 a reporter from right-wing outlet The Blaze claimed that over 1000 mail in ballots were found in a California dumpster.  Those ballots were actually extra ballots being disposed of from a 2018  election. The Blaze didn’t report it that way. Trump didn’t amplify it  that way. Other right-wing sources didn’t repeat it that way. It got  enormous play and repeated attention from those inside the Trump  campaign including Donald Trump Jr.    The claim of finding thousands of discarded ballots was repeated at  multiple points during the election. It became a meme that could be  repeated about the backrooms of polling stations the trash cans at  counting facilities or mysterious mailmen working routes anywhere in  the country. At this point few Trump supporters would be likely to  identify the date or the state connected to either of these stories  originally. They just know it happened. Somewhere. And it was important.   The report from The Blaze provided the Trump campaign with one of  those thematic notes that could be repeated and adapted to any  situation. Claims of discarded ballots only became more frequent after  Trump’s loss. Like boxes of ballots from China they became something  that “everybody knows.” Even though it never happened.   The author of that story in The Blaze Elijah Schaffer was there for the Jan. 6 insurgency. He was one of those who broke into Nancy Pelosi’s office. On Friday Republicans once again made it clear that they would not support a commission investigating events connected to Jan. 6 in spite  of Democratic efforts to go above and beyond in making that commission  truly bipartisan. That’s not because Republicans are disinterested. It’s  because they already know the answers.   Jan. 6 didn’t happen just on that day. It’s the result of years of  effort on the part of conservative institutions Republican politicians  and right-wing media to undermine faith in democracy. Donald Trump  didn’t build this train he just hopped on.   The Big Lie isn’t something Republicans are interested in fighting  because it’s their Big Lie as much as Trump’s. They’ve nurtured it.  They’ve fed it time and attention. And they’ve staked their future on  the ability to execute the strategy based on that lie.    The purpose of voter suppression laws is keeping people from the polls and  convincing them that voting is unfair. Both. Win by breaking democracy  on Election Day or win by breaking democracy after Election Day. It’s still a win.   The only way Republicans can lose is if someone throws a cog into the  works. Say by investigating the evens of Jan. 6 so that those events  become a one-time disaster rather than a warm-up exercise. Posted with permission from Daily Kos.
