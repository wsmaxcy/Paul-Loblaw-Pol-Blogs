L, Colorado State Open Thread 5/10/2021, ColoTim, 2021-05-10, The Colorado State Open Thread is designed to cover issues of interest to people who have an interest in the state of Colorado the people who live here and aspects of the politics natural beauty and happenings of this state.  People are encouraged to contact the blog host if they’d like to write a guest open thread — there will be opportunities coming up as we finally do some vacations to just stretch our arms and legs and see other areas of this great big world. Today’s open thread is going to look back at yesterday’s holiday — Mother’s Day.  I’d like to survey the folk and see whether you celebrated this day by either honoring your own (or a close relative) on this day or perhaps you were honored by your own children.  Maybe you were an honorary mention because of how someone may have raised you or you raised child(ren) who weren’t biological but in all other respects were yours.  Maybe you were part of the foster system. The survey at the end of this open thread is just for fun.  I’m curious how many people personally were involved in yesterday’s holiday.  I lost my mother back in 2018 and my father a few months later so Mother’s Day and Father’s Day don’t hold the same cachet they used to.  I did have the mother of one of my best friends in junior and senior high schools who I used to call “Mom” and she claimed me as her only “son” and though she’s now 90 years old she’s still kicking around.  I called her yesterday to wish her a “Happy Mother’s Day” and we had an enjoyable few minutes on the phone talking about family weather and changes to our homes and situations.  I was also pleased I was able to dial her number after a few years without even trying to remember it.   Her husband passed away a number of years ago so I do not have anyone to call for Father’s Day but one of my favorite Father’s Days was the early part of this century.  One year while trying to be a father figure for my girlfriend’s two kids I was bummed out that I received no acknowledgement of my efforts.  The next year I received a T-shirt with the outlines of the kids’ hands done on it with some sort of fabric marker.  I have preserved that shirt even nearly 20 years after we broke up and I still consider it a treasure.   On a different note I do wish to solicit for guest writers for open threads that are coming up in June.  I’ll be happy to receive either finished diaries or to make sure you know the way to publish the open threads so that they’re part of the whole list.  You would be helping me out greatly by not forcing me to publish generic diaries again. On a third note here is what it looks like right now out the window of my office.  I don’t know how many more snow days we’re going to have this season but this snow is supposed to continue into Wednesday midday when it changes to showers for the following 24-48 hours.
