C, The Week in Pictures: Knife & Razor Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-24, So have I got this right? This was the week we learned that knife-fighting is just a typical rite of passage for youth today and the police should just stay out of it. Occam’s Razor would suggest this is idiocy but I guess a knife beats even Occam’s blade though I am surprised some nitwit hasn’t suggested that police officers deploy rocks since rocks beat scissors and I’m sure there’s a pusillanimous postmodern paper explaining the transitive properties of rocks to knives in the Journal of Woke Policing.                             Our government at work.             Headlines of the week:                   Apparently not real. But how can you tell these days?                                         And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
