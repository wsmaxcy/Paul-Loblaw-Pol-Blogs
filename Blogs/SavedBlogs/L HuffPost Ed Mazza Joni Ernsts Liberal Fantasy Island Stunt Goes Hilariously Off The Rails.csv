L, Joni Ernst's 'Liberal Fantasy Island' Stunt Goes Hilariously Off The Rails, Ed Mazza, 2021-04-29, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) on Wednesday unveiled a chart showing what she called a “Liberal Fantasy Island.”  Ernst broke out her visual aid during a speech on the floor as part of a GOP “pre-buttal” ahead of President Joe Biden’s first speech to a joint session of Congress: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) unveils a "Liberal Fantasy Island" infographic. pic.twitter.com/eVkwkWhFDp But it wasn’t long before her chart started trending on Twitter for an entirely different reason.   Writer/comic Keaton Patti gave Ernst’s chart a makeover causing “Abolish Lasagna” to trend on Twitter:  wtf even are some of these??????? pic.twitter.com/cRpp1qFkXR Some felt obliged to fact-check a meme from a comedy writer:  This viral tweet is fake. Senator Ernst's poster had "TAX INCREASE" not "SEX BLIMPS" on her Liberal Fantasy Island poster. Several of the other items are doctored too. https://t.co/T37L1Ubw26 But most decided to have a little fun with it:   If we get Sex Blimps it'll be a Goodyear. https://t.co/8E5dQ5yCvJ I dont want a sex blimp. I want many sex blimps. https://t.co/jxZr7G0Sng Let’s compromise. We won’t abolish lasagna straights can still go to restaurants and the sex blimps can be run on a purely private enterprise basis. In return we get the Green New Deal DC as a state and expanded courts. https://t.co/gNR1aLShLx I hope Biden spends some time on the sex blimps tonight. #JointAddress #accountablegop pic.twitter.com/xKhqSBgW8E imagine how fun restaurants would be if only gays got to go tho playlist would be out of this world #abolishlasagna #sexblimps pic.twitter.com/XBNpjQ6IE5 Just so everyone is clear where I stand I am PRO #SexBlimps and AGAINST #AbolishLasagna pic.twitter.com/YovrGfVWjF Oh!Found it! ;-)#SexBlimps pic.twitter.com/ix6tZaSuOI #SexBlimps: Celebrity Edition. pic.twitter.com/izp1CcfJxk
