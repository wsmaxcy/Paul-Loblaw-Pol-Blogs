L, Happy Fourth of July!, TexMex, 2021-07-04, Just a tiny useless diary.  This mouse yelling…. Mexican American!  Not Cuban American! Not Puerto Rican American. Just because our heritage has a Spanish language history doesn’t make us all the same.  We have distinct cultural differences and history.  We are not naturally allies of each other.   Too many people think everybody is  Puerto Rican American or Cuban American because they are on the east coast and close to New York media sources. But a huge portion of the United States is a very distinct place of culture and history.  So old pieces from the past for your reading pleasure. Nuremburg I'll never forget I was rich I had shoes Who the hell am I? Flaco Jimenez Victimas-del-Hurucan-Beulah Flies crickets and TexMex Maizie The Union Maid  Please don’t drink and drive. Finally! ShelterBox USA FDA approves Vertex Trikafta for children ages 6 and older We are just waiting for the process to go through for her to get it delivered!
