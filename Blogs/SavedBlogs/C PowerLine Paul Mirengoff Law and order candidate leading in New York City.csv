C, Law and order candidate leading in New York City, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-06-22, Last night I  wrote about the Democratic mayoral primary in New York City. Steve  wrote about the same subject today.  Both of us pointed out that Eric Adams a former cop who promises to increase the city’s police presence is the frontrunner. An Adams victory we thought would send a strong message to Democrats. The message? Voters want more not less policing. Tonight the  results are coming in and with around 80 percent of the city’s precincts reporting Adams holds the lead. He’s at 31 percent. Maya Wiley the hard-left candidate endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is second at 21.5 percent. Just behind her at 20.5 percent is Kathryn Garcia the choice of much of the city’s Democratic establishment. Andrew Yang lags way behind at 12 percent. Adams is killing it in the Bronx where he’s captured about 45 percent of the vote. He also leads in Queens Brooklyn (where he’s from) and Staten Island. Garcia leads in Manhattan where Adams is running a distant third. As Steve and I noted the election process isn’t straightforward given the use of ranked-choice voting. But however that plays out I think it’s significant that the relatively moderate law and order candidate has outpolled his rivals; that his vote and that of the establishment candidate exceeds 50 percent; and that the radical candidate endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez barely cleared 20 percent. It seems the mood of the city’s Democratic electorate has changed significantly since Bill de Blasio prevailed in 2013 and 2017. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
