C, Breaking: Eight dead in Indianapolis FedEx shooting; suspect dead , Ed Morrissey, 2021-04-16, At this time there isn’t much known about the mass shooting in Indianapolis other than the casualties. Police report eight dead plus the suspect who apparently took his own life. The suspect reportedly was yelling something during the attack but no one is yet sure what it was who he was or what motive there might have been — if any: At least eight people were killed by a gunman who opened fire inside a major FedEx facility in Indianapolis before taking his own life. Investigators are searching for a motive. @stephgosk reports. pic.twitter.com/4a7FTipA3Q — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 16 2021  A gunman killed eight people and wounded several others before killing himself in a late-night shooting at a FedEx facility near the Indianapolis airport police said in the latest in a spate of mass shootings after a relative lull during the pandemic. Five people were hospitalized after the Thursday night shooting according to police. One of them had critical injuries police spokesperson Genae Cook said. Another two people were treated and released at the scene. FedEx said people who worked for the company were among the dead. … The shooter wasn’t immediately identified and investigators were in the process of conducting interviews and gathering information. Cook said it was too early to tell whether the shooter was an employee at the facility. “We’re still trying to ascertain the exact reason and cause for this incident” she said. One witness inside the building described the scene to WTHR: “I’m at a bench and so I stand up and take a look at the entrance door and by the time I see the door I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yellin’ stuff that I could not understand” Levi Miller told 13News. “What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.” Miller said he went into survival mode. “When you’re in that situation your instincts kick in” he said. “When you’re in that moment in life a lot of things start moving inside you from your mind and it all happens in a second. All for you to keep living.” The shooting apparently extended out to the parking lot where at least one person was wounded: Vehicle of FedEx employee. Family tells me she drove across the street after her car was shot into in the parking lot. She was hit and transported to hospital @WTHRcom pic.twitter.com/HQOqyY9XzJ — Allen Carter (@CarterNews) April 16 2021  Right now not much more is known although that won’t likely stop speculation or demands for policy responses.
