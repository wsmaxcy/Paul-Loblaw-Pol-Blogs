L, This McConnell statement a green light to write the jobs/infrastructure/family bills Americans want, Egberto Willies, 2021-05-03, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has all but given the green light to Democrats to give Americans the policies they want. See full episodes here. It seems like Mitch McConnell does not realize that his party is not the one in power. He believes he is in control. This was McConnell in an earlier news conference. "Summing it up we are happy to take a look at an infrastructure package; that's what basically both sides agree is infrastructure" the minority leader said. "And we are not willing to pay for it by undoing the 2017 tax bill." Understand what Mitch McConnell is saying. Republicans want as little as possible to go to old-style infrastructure. Stating that he will only agree on what they agree on in common is ludicrous. What Republican politicians want is a subset of what Democrats and the American people are demanding. If Democrats were to negotiate on McConnell's terms it would mean the Republican politicians will get all they want. Democrat in effect would pass solely Republican policies. One must note that when McConnell and his Cabal passed the Trump tax cut scam McConnell did not write a bill with the commonality of both sides. They used reconciliation to do it. The Republican Party has been rejected soundly over the last several decades with few exceptions. A flawed constitution that inherently enables minority rule has allowed the disenfranchisement of millions of Americans. Democrats have a small window to mitigate this aberration. One hopes they do the job they were elected to do.
