L, Sen. Tim Scott's Rebuttal: 'America Is Not A Racist Nation.' Twitter Disagrees, Susie Madrak, 04-29-21, People really liked Joe Biden's speech last night so Tim Scott's response (in which he reassured some unknown group of viewers that "America is not a racist nation') was puzzling to say the least. I mean he says he's been pulled over by police nine times for no reason. Why does he suppose that is? CBS News poll among speech watchers:85% approve of Biden's speech just 15% disapprove. — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 29 2021 Remind me Senator: what year was a Confederate flag carried into this nation's Capitol through a broken window as part of a violent rebellion incited by the then-sitting president? https://t.co/78wLvwqzJS pic.twitter.com/jzQnK3rsSw — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) April 29 2021 Nicolle Wallace fact checks Sen.

Tim Scott said "our public schools should have reopened months ago."This implies the federal government decides to keep schools closed. It doesn't. Those decisions are made at a district or state level. https://t.co/Y4XHDX9wuD pic.twitter.com/5BphaC1Lea — NPR (@NPR) April 29 2021 “It was disappointing. He had an opportunity to really speak about his work on the George Floyd Act and what he’s trying to do to offer his own amendments to it. He didn’t.” @JoyAnnReid reacts to Sen. Tim Scott’s rebuttal. Watch live coverage on @MSNBC. pic.twitter.com/oxlkAnkMFG — MSNBC Public Relations (@MSNBCPR) April 29 2021 So much of Tim Scott’s speech was geared to rebutting a Biden address on structural racism that he didn’t deliver and obviously wasn’t going to deliver — latest example of GOP elites getting high on their own supply. — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) April 29 2021 If those were his beliefs I absolutely agree. But Tim Scott is a smart man & he lied to us. He thinks we aren't smart enough to read the Georgia voting bill & that there is no racism. Read his real story about racism. He was right though America is not racist the GQP is. — L Karelli (Fox News is the Big Lie Network) (@lkarelli) April 29 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
