L, Wednesday FP&IE Daily Open Thread: The Baltic Sea Edition Part II - F-35s and 5/6G, Bo RealisforForeign Policy And International Events Group, 2021-04-21, Welcome to an all day open thread hosted by “Foreign Policy and International Events Group”. Drop by to share links and stories or for commentary. (or just play peekaboo and say look what I found). Who are we and what we are trying do → Launching A Dailykos Discussions and Republishing Group For International or Foreign Policy Stuff Continuing the Baltic Tour we head to the north shore of the Baltic Sea. You can read part I: Amber Oil Shale and Gas Pipes here. By popular demand our shore visits have been slightly shortened.  International relations: The Scandinavians have always been maritime people of trade and shipping and their explorations and exploitations have not been confined to the Baltic Sea. Late in the colonial game of expansion and exploitation the Swedish East India Company was established in 1731 — almost a century behind other European trading companies — following the British and Dutch East India Company’s success in the Far East. Still for almost a century the Swedish East India Company was the largest company in Sweden until it folded in 1813. A Danish East Asia Company meanwhile was established in 1616 but the Napoleonic wars and the Royal Navy forced the Danes too out of the colonial business in 1850. Now those historic trade ties have been reinvented and investments in IT-technology especially has created new 21st century opportunities for cooperation between India and the Nordics. Denmark and India as part of the India-Nordic-Baltic drive: Strategically India’s engagement with the Nordic-Baltic region will play a pivotal role in the emerging new diplomatic dynamics in the Eurasia region. Nordic Outreach: Denmark's PM to arrive in New Delhi first head of government to visit India amid COVID crisis Last year saw a virtual summit between Denmark's PM and Indian PM Modi the first such summit of the latter with a Nordic country. India and Denmark have a unique "Green Strategic Partnership" that will see both sides focusing on "green and climate-friendly technologies" said a joint statement released after the September virtual summit. Baltic security: after a long wait “level 3 partner” Denmark becomes the 5th NATO member — following the UK the Netherlands Norway and Italy — to be armed with the F-35 fighter: First of long-awaited F-35 fighter jets handed over to @forsvaretdk and Denmark by @LockheedMartin  https://t.co/MF0pmFuFkn pic.twitter.com/1VCwrYeJtC  It was way back in 1997 that Denmark signed on to the F-35 fighter jet industrial co-operation.  Today in a roll-out ceremony in Fort Worth Texas the first F-35 was handed over to Denmark by the aerospace company Lockheed Martin. Baltic non-NATO neighbour Finland has also been given the green light to buy the “NATO-compatible” F-35s if Lockheed Martin wins the ongoing Finnish HX fighter competition. Sweden meanwhile will continue to invest in their own Saab Gripen programme also in the game for the new Finnish fighter. Enjoying the longer days? In #Sweden the word "dagsmeja" is used to describe the end of the winter when the days become longer and the sun appears to melt away the snow despite the minus degrees. #WordOfTheNorth pic.twitter.com/onsMy4Ke4F  Domestic politics: Odd bedfellows — and you thought perhaps that liberals and far-right populists don’t mix…? The second smallest party in the Swedish parliament the Liberals is again dominating the headlines after it approved proposals to campaign for a centre-right government in next year's general election opening the door to cooperation with the far-right… https://t.co/G9b3mOZoLt  Sweden has a left-green minority government and one of the weakest in Sweden’s history of many minority governments. This is possible because the opposition has agreed to support Löfven’s government in order to freeze out the far-right misogynistic racist anti-immigrant and increasingly pro-Putin Sweden Democrats. Now the Liberals (centre-right classical liberalism whose leader Nyamko Sabuni herself is a Zairean refugee) seem to be flirting with the Sweden Democrats for political power. What’s happening?  The Liberal party’s national committee voted 59-31 in favour of campaigning as part of a right-wing alliance in the 2022 general election approving a proposal from leader Nyamko Sabuni. The committee also voted that the party’s leadership can negotiate with the populist Sweden Democrats on policy and even involve them in budget negotiations. International relations: Sweden was the first Western country to establish official diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China back in 1950. Now Sweden and China have fallen out bigly starting with the disappearance of a Chinese-born Swedish bookseller in 2015 on human rights Uighurs Confucius Institutes in Sweden Hong Kong Huawei/5G ban. The EU’s front line with China: Stockholm “The influence of the Chinese state over the country’s private sector provides strong incentives for companies to act in accordance with the goals of the Chinese Communist Party’s national strategies” said Sweden’s Post and Telecom Authority citing an assessment by Sweden’s Security Services when it banned Huawei and ZTE from the 5G rollout last fall. "The Swedish Security Service judges that the Chinese state and security services can influence and exert pressure on Huawei" PTS said before repeating the same point for ZTE. China's commerce ministry on January 21 vowed to take "all necessary measures" in response.   Sweden and India meanwhile: There is every reason to strengthen relations with 🇮🇳 and 🇸🇪 is certainly up front among the counties seeking to do that. Here an overview of the ongoing broad efforts. https://t.co/mxJZfNLvqm   By Debasis Bhattacharya The foundation of such strong partnership and longstanding cordiality between the two countries are based on shared values of democracy rule of law pluralism institutional affinity equality freedom of speech and respect for human rights. The historic visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sweden in 2018 the first of its kind after nearly three decades has been a turning point in taking the bilateral relationship to the next stage while expanding and strengthening the contours of strategic cooperation like never before. Apart from deciding to expand defence and security partnership the two leaders called for boosting cooperation on climate change high-tech and innovation partnership research and development healthcare innovation trade and investment leadership skill and industry transition. But no Sweden and the United States? Hmm. With 🇪🇺🇸🇪🇫🇮 world leaders in 5G it is indeed strange that 🇺🇸 lines up with 🇯🇵 and not with them for 6G development. This can be seen as 🇺🇸 deliberately undercutting 🇪🇺🇸🇪🇫🇮 in the global technology race. https://t.co/9K1BDd01U1    The Baltic Sea Philharmonic is a unique community of musicians from ten Baltic countries with spectacles of sound light visual art and technology transcending borders and boundaries by bringing people together.  The last leg of the Baltic tour will take us to Finland and Russia. Vi ses! Other General Open Threads That Run In Daily Kos.
