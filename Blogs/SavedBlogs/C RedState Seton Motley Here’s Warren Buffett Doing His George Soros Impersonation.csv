C, Here’s Warren Buffett Doing His George Soros Impersonation, Seton Motley, 2020-12-17, George Soros is an exceedingly awful person.  Who has spent decades spending billions of his nigh-limitless dollars making the United States a much MUCH more heinous place. Care for some examples? George Soros 89 Is Still on a Quest to Destroy America George Soros Transfers Billions to Open Society Foundations Complete List of U.S. Organizations Funded by George Soros George Soros’ Family ’Is Really Running the Democrat Party’ In 2006 George Soros Funded a Project to Elect Progressive Liberals to Secretary of State Offices — Now You Know Why Surprised? Democrats’ Mail-in-Voting Campaign Funded by George Soros Mr. President It’s Time to Investigate George Soros for Funding Domestic Terrorism Crime Spikes as Soros-Funded DAs Take Charge Conversely Warren Buffett is sort of considered America’s Uncle.  If your uncle is a multi-multi-billionaire stock market mogul. Buffett is genial and soft-spoken.  He is a Leftist – but is not thought of as obnoxiously so. But this is pretty obnoxious: Warren Buffett-Funded Foundation Secretly Paid For Protest To Stop Construction Of A Highly Contentious Pipeline: “Roughly 700 activists were arrested in 2016 for protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline an underground oil pipeline connecting the Bakken shale oil fields in northwest North Dakota with a storage facility in Illinois…. “The protests became ‘more like a riot’ on Sept. 3 2016 according to Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier. “Activists broke down fences then ‘crossed onto private property and accosted private security officers with wooden posts and flag poles’ Kirchmeier said. “One security guard was stabbed in the side with a wooden stake then trampled. Others were threatened with knives and kicked by horses. Additionally two dogs including one that was injured when it was hit with a 2×4 were taken to an area veterinary clinic for treatment. “Over the following weeks riots property damage and violence continued in bursts resulting in the arrests of hundreds of individuals – 93 percent of whom were from outside of North Dakota according to local law enforcement officials. “Protesters chained themselves to heavy machinery and broke windows out of construction vehicles. Two men were charged with reckless endangerment for ramming a vehicle into a truck. “One of those men’s sons later pled guilty to the felony kidnapping of a Native American woman he initially met at the Standing Rock protests. The woman said she was raped and beaten threatened with a knife and strangled by the man when they met up in Minnesota on her way to another pipeline protest early the following year…. “Hundreds of those arrested were freed from jail by one man – an obscure 26-year-old from a small town in Oregon – who admits to paying more than $100000 in cash bond payments. “The mysterious payments…appear to be linked to radical environmental groups funded in part by Warren Buffett who had a personal financial stake in preventing the construction of the pipeline.” Guess who besides Buffett is funding the violence and mayhem?  Soros via his Tides Foundation – natch: “Honor the Earth regularly receives funding from the Tides Foundation including a $63000 gift specifically earmarked to support the Standing Rock Reservation protests.” But this is a lot of Soros-esque obnoxious behavior by Uncle Warren: “The NoVo Foundation an organization run by Warren Buffett’s youngest son Peter and Peter’s wife Jennifer also regularly contribute to Honor the Earth…. “(Daddy) Buffett…donated almost the entire $182 million in funding the NoVo Foundation received in 2018…. “On its website the (Novo) foundation boasts that its financial support of the Water Protector Legal Collective will be used ‘to leverage information and experience gained through litigation and advocacy at Standing Rock.’… “In addition to pocketing $944000 from the National Lawyers Guild between 2016 and 2017 the Water Protector Legal Collective also received more than $1 million from the Novo Foundation….” And Uncle Warren is funding this mass violence – to score some coin?  I mean does he really need even more money THIS bad? Apparently he thinks he does: “The Buffett family’s interest in the fight to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline appears to go beyond environmental concerns or the desire to preserve tribal lands. “Buffett who donated almost the entire $182 million in funding the NoVo Foundation received in 2018 is the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway. “The holding company owns BNSF (formerly the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway) a railroad with existing infrastructure capable of delivering oil and natural gas from North Dakota to oil terminals in the Midwest. “If the Water Protector Legal Collective the Freshet Collective Honor the Earth and other environmental organizations funded by the NoVo Foundation succeeded in stopping the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline Berkshire Hathaway would have been positioned to collect significant sums transporting oil from North Dakota…. “‘I think that it’s fair to call NoVo a major part of Warren Buffett’s financial interests and not just a foundation associated with his family’ said (Capital Research Center researcher Hayden) Ludwig. ‘So it’s not surprising to see NoVo mixed up in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.’ “‘NoVo should have withdrawn funding to the anti-pipeline protests to avoid even the image of a conflict of interest’ according to Ludwig. ‘Supporting these protests was irresponsible.’” It is exceedingly irresponsible.  And damaging to the country.  And pathetic.  And obnoxious. And infuriating. How very Soros of you Uncle Warren.
