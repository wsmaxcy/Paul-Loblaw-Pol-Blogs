L, Street Prophets Friday: A Night for Witches, Marko the Werelynx, 2021-04-30, Greetings and welcome to a slightly scorched bit of fluff. ‘Tis but another wee community open thread with a selection of photos from my week to get us started. How’s everybody hanging in there? I started my week out in the country.     Back in the big city there was more mundane tasks to do. The battle with the bureaucracy continues. Renewing my long-term visa turns out to be the most needlessly complicated thing I’ve done in over twenty years. The Ministry of the Interior finally sent me a letter to inform me that I need to make a personal appearance at their offices— as I tried to do a month ago. The letter included a non-functional telephone number for me to use to call and make an appointment. I’ll show up bright and early on Monday and find somebody to wave my letter at. My latest discovery in the world of distractions is Don’t Ask Tig a podcast by comedian Tig Notaro. The current episode features Fran Lebowitz. I found Tig’s podcast via Paula Poundstone’s podcast website where I actually explored a bit for a change. Turns out Paula had done an episode of Tig’s podcast— and it’s wonderful. As was the episode with Fran Lebowitz and every other episode I’ve listened to from the archives. Working my way through from the beginning. Now I understand the in-jokes. I’m becoming quite the avid podcast listener. It seems to have replaced music as the thing in my ear while I’m doing something creative. Mrs the Werelynx took today off from work and we headed back out to the country. Today is a special day of celebration in the Czech Republic. The night before May 1st is a night for witches— ostensibly for burning witches in effigy but it’s become more a celebration of witches over the years. There may be witches on the bonfires but the crowds that gather around are filled with witches.  My little witch Mrs the Werelynx has always encouraged me to make a little witch to burn. Many countries in Europe have a similar witchy bonfire tradition one year I went to a bonfire on the summer solstice in Denmark. This year the public bonfires were broken up into smaller family-sized bonfires. We never go to the village or city parks for the public bonfires anyway. A small fire in our yard out in the country is enough for us. The wind’s picking up outside. We’ve sent #2 Son out to douse the embers. We should get some rain later tonight and we’ve been promised a soggy weekend out here in the country. Earlier #2 Son helped me get the new raised planter box nearly finished. We might be filling it in the rain tomorrow— or we might work on clearing out the barn for a load of firewood we’re expecting to be delivered soon. I’ll get some close up pics of the construction (such as it is) for next week. I don’t expect it to last more than a couple of years. I was mostly looking for a way to get some use out of some old wooden beams we had in the barn. Thanks for stopping by. This is an open thread.
