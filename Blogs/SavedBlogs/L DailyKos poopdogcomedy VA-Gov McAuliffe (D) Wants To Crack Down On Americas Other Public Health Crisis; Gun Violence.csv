L, VA-Gov: McAuliffe (D) Wants To Crack Down On America's Other Public Health Crisis; Gun Violence, poopdogcomedy, 2021-07-03, Received this e-mail today from former Governor Terry McAuliffe’s (D. VA) gubernatorial campaign: You know it just as well as I do -- gun violence is a public health crisis in the United States. But my Trump-endorsed opponent Glenn Youngkin doesn’t agree. He’s been endorsed by AR-15-toting extremist Amanda Chase. He’s bragged about being a lifetime member of the NRA. And he’s already promised not to sign any legislation enacting common sense gun violence prevention measures. We are in a crisis. The last thing Virginia needs right now is a Governor promising to put more guns on our streets. Are you with me? Sign my petition and tell Glenn Youngkin that we are ready to end the scourge of gun violence in Virginia. We need to enact common sense gun reforms immediately. That starts with banning the sale of assault weapons. I’ve never been afraid to speak up on this issue. That’s why the NRA was running attack ads against me even before their guy Glenn bought his party’s nomination. Now they’re joining forces. They think Youngkin’s $75 million warchest and Donald Trump’s backing give him a real shot to win. Let’s prove them wrong. Will you add your name and help me stand up to Glenn Youngkin and the NRA? It’s time to ban the sale of assault weapons in Virginia. -- Terry Click here to add your name.
