L, "An injustice to one is an injustice to all."  Don't give me that garbage., Observer of the Absurd, 2021-04-23, Governor Cuomo is being called on to resign for disturbing allegations that he treated women around him with disrespect and unwanted advances.  If true these things are deeply disgusting and demeaning towards women.  A few years ago Al Franken was forced to resign from his position for simply pantomiming grabbing a woman’s breasts a joke in terribly bad taste. My daughter was sexually assaulted by a sixty year old man when she was ten years old in the state of New Jersey.  When she told us two years later the man was arrested charged and indicted for child sexual assault.  She my wife and two friends were at his shore house the evening she was attacked.  He was allowed to plead to a misdemeanor awarded with six months of county-paid therapy given a three-year restraining order and at the end of six months of counseling they expunged his record.  No jail time other then the nine days he was in lockup waiting to raise bail. It turns out that the prosecutor said “I don’t think he would do it again” and “My husband is the same age and he wouldn’t want to go to prison” and that he “looked like an absent minded professor.”  She refused to call my wife’s friend as a witness who was there that night and spent the time talking us into a “pre-trial intervention” which is what they give to 19-year olds who get get caught with their 17 year old girlfriends so it doesn’t ruin their life. Cory Booker said in his campaign for president that “an injustice to one is an injustice to all” alluding to the fact that race relations are unequal and that the way people are treated in the justice system with respect to race is often unfair to the point of being written in the laws that way.  When we called his office to start an investigation into why the prosecutor was working for the defense instead we never got any response.   Every time we see someone paying for their crimes be it a cop who killed or a cop killer my wife fumes asking why they sent to prison while the guy who attacked our daughter was given a warm handshake and a pat on the back.
