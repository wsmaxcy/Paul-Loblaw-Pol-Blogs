L, Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger R-Lewiston accused of rape resigns after ethics committee backs expulsion, Hank Z, 2021-04-30, Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger's resignation letter was read aloud on the House floor Thursday afternoon. … The Idaho Legislature's ethics committee voted unanimously Thursday morning to find that a state representative committed "conduct unbecoming" in his pursuit of multiple women who work at the Statehouse including a 19-year-old woman who says the lawmaker raped her in his apartment. The members of the committee advanced a motion to censure Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger R-Lewiston by suspending him without pay or benefits ordering him to leave the Capitol immediately and calling for a substitute lawmaker to be appointed in his place. The motion also supported a resolution to permanently expel von Ehlinger from the Legislature. ... Detectives with the Boise Police Department are currently investigating the rape allegation against von Ehlinger. As of Thursday morning he has not been criminally charged. Members of the ethics committee have repeatedly said that the hearing was not aimed at determining whether the lawmaker and the intern had consensual sex; rather members were tasked with deciding whether von Ehlinger's behavior toward female employees was inappropriate and "detrimental to the integrity of the House as a legislative body." On Wednesday committee members heard testimony that in addition to his encounter with Jane Doe the 38-year-old legislator also had a sexual relationship with a young Capitol security guard and made romantic advances toward a clerk and a lobbyist. Rep. Brent Crane R-Nampa said von Ehlinger had displayed "a predatory pattern" arguing that his actions "were extremely detrimental to the integrity of the House." Several lawmakers also noted that von Ehlinger had attended multiple Respectful Workplace trainings and been warned by colleagues to be more careful in his words and actions towards female employees. "This pattern of behavior of not only ignoring counsel on appropriate workplace boundaries but also pursuing relationships - including sexual relationships - in the House creates an unsafe work environment in the House for any women the representative may be interested in dating" Rep. John McCrostie D-Boise said. "Common sense and basic morality dictate that an elected representative should not entertain a relationship with a student intern regardless of who initiated the relationship." Rep. Wendy Horman R-Idaho Falls agreed. She said she was not convinced by the argument by von Ehlinger's counsel that he had not done anything wrong and could not be punished because there was no written rule that specifically bans a lawmaker from having sex with a teenage staffer. "There is no House rule against poisoning another person yet his behavior has poisoned the reputation of all of us and tarnished and discredited other elected officials" she said. Rep. John Gannon D-Boise thanked Doe for her "tremendous courage" in testifying in the hearings and admonished members of the audience he said harassed and attempted to follow her as she left the Idaho Capitol after testifying Wednesday. Several people - including Rep. Priscilla Giddings R-Whitebird - have widely shared the woman's name photo and personal details. "We have to consider what we would want for our children if they came to the Idaho Legislature to serve" Gannon told his fellow representatives. Interns and other young people who work at the Legislature deserve "a safe place a positive experience and [to] be treated with respect" Gannon said. "That didn't happen in this case."
