L, The Border: Hillary’s Emails 2.0, paradox, 2021-05-05, Enough time has passed on another nauseating US journalism corps spasm of chattering incompetence for a true record of what happened with the faintest of hopes consequent criticism would change the behavior of our squirrel journalism scribes. We are of course discussing the Mexican border story coverage of the last 60 days. One regrettably unforeseen byproduct of President Biden’s normal psychology behavior is that the outrageous outbursts and wild policy behavior of Trump gave way to a plain vanilla existence that offered no zing or drama and our journalism cousins got bored. Into this blissful slide of White House calm was and is a frenetic Republican background attempt to make anything negative stick to Biden that couldn’t reveal stupid and regressive Republican policy. Hunter Biden had real problems! President Biden is a doddering socialist who will outlaw hamburgers! One element of hurled Republican pasta was the Mexican border given the amazing border mess inherited  from Trump and desperate parents getting their children over the border US detention facilities were being overrun and breaking the 72 hour rule for child detention. Republicans started braying Biden was an incompetent hypocrite who blithely accepted child abuse and couldn’t handle the border or immigration. Not only did our journalism cousins possess restless boredom they now took on political actor power. Being a journalist is essentially to be a life bystander it’s fast and fascinating but still just storytelling many journalists know they’ll never make real power or influence decisions in a career empty of new human accomplishment. They don’t like it naturally and in the human ego failing of things decided that occasionally journalism gets political power. One can see this clearly from the movie The Paper an anguished city official is railing against a journalist for the ridiculous arbitrary unfairness and the answer is blunt: it’s your turn. The Republicans launched a negative Biden attack on the border and our bored restless journalists flipped on a dime to the precise Republican framing and attack points. It’s amazing to see really journalists only watch themselves for setting agenda in just 72 hours all of contemptible teevee journalism somehow took on the cue to make the border a huge political story crisis crisis crisis! One team even set up a temporary set on the border as if the background of sky and cacti could somehow mask their dithering incompetence. Their print brothers and sisters were of course along for the ride the Washington Post relentlessly hyping the crisis crisis crisis! for weeks as documented by Eric Boehlert. Not only did this imaginary crisis come of nowhere so did too this amazing journalism arrogance that the border could be a real negative Biden issue for the 2022 midterms. Rightly criticized for such a rank political power play naturally they dug in further with their border obsession when President Biden had his first press conference they could ask no other policy questions not one. Like all blathering journalism power plays this one eventually faded when there’s essentially nothing there it’s hard to pretend it’s real every night. This time the process was greatly speeded up by a television appearance of Amanda Marcotte and Greg Sargent who rightly ripped our journalists for being such offensive lemmings. American journalists ignore professional criticism as much as they can but they still heard it and it stuck oh yes. Also too that obsessive press conference where they could ask about nothing but the border was an unusually stark example of obsession and incompetence criticism of that wasn’t so easily ignored. So now we have Hillary’s Emails 2.0 the Mexican border story of 2021 it’s faded now but may come back. A story of rank and stupid Republican attack where nothing but the tiniest of policy dimension gets blown up into a screaming crisis that inflicts incalculable damage to a Democratic official and the American public. Why does the American journalism corps do this? Why do they keep doing it? Churlishly restless bored corporate in base form and immature in their grasp for relevance. Finally the PBS Newshour ABC News and the Washington Post thinks we’re stupid. They really do possess a profound contempt for American little people intelligence and blithely write off their incompetence as basely okay the little people are too stupid to notice know or care. There’s no accountability mechanism to correct them they set the story agenda and the ratings still roll in every month with that contempt and freedom they’re as stupid and unprofessional as they were with Hillary’s emails they haven’t learned or grown at all. Thomas Friedman is good today for once in the New York Times illuminating Republican regression very well and its grave danger to the Republic. Okay Mr. Friedman you’re so right but from where this little person sits and watches a berserk and power-play American journalism corps is just as much a danger to the Republic as a fascist Republican Party. Try writing that maybe they’ll listen to you they certainly think the rest of us are too stupid to know or care.
