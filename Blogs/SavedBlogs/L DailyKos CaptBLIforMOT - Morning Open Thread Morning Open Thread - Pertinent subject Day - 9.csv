L, Morning Open Thread - Pertinent subject Day - 9, CaptBLIforMOT - Morning Open Thread, 2021-05-09, Morning Open Thread is a daily copyrighted post from a host of editors and guest writers. We support our community invite and share ideas and encourage thoughtful respectful dialogue in an open forum. I’ve been given the task of hosting the Sunday edition of the MOT time.  I am not sure what we will discover today.  Let’s see what we can explore. The diarist gets to sleep in if she so desires and can show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Join us please. There are two interchangeable topics for today.  The first is an inanimate object and the second is created only with the first.  Let’s explore the Chair and the result of sitting the Lap.    The item shown is labeled “The Presidential” by a world renown furniture manufacturer.  This particular chair serves as a recliner as well.  Any human that sits in it immediately presents a lap.  When this chair is in the alternate position the person becomes part of the seating surface for any other creature that seeks a lap in its distorted configuration. .  .  .  There are some historical figures that can be associated with a chair and sitting.  Let’s look at a few examples. If this guy shows up any month of the year but December he is considered odd and one should be wary.  Put a chair in the room and his lap becomes a place of joy for children (and some adults) to voice there desires. I find it sort of creepy that a stranger’s lap can be so appealing just because of a fairy tale a white beard and red suit.  .  .  . This woman is known for sitting in a chair.  I don’t know her first name either and expect you don’t.  She is holding a few things in her lap that prevents her child from hoping up for a cuddle.  Some laps are meant to be vacant.  .  .  .  .  .  This guy.  Chair and lap are present (in a huge way) and recognized by every American.  The public is not allowed to disturb this figure in any way.  .  .  .  .  . The final photo is my ability to present a lap in a favorite chair of mine.  The photo shows the usual effect when I sit.  It seems I have a desirable lap for cat napping.  A moment of purring induced vibration is followed by lack of circulation in my legs.  But I never need leg warmers in the winter.  .  .  .  . This song was presented the year I was born Elvis was known more for his swinging hips than his lap.  Though Graceland his home in Memphis Tennessee is considered a lap of luxury.   A selection from “Playing for Change”   I have one more song for the kid in all of us.    That was more fun than I though i would have.  Pull up a chair create a lap have a beverage and join the conversation.  Thanks for stopping by.  While your at it invite a mom or grandmother to join you.  They have earned this day to sit and take a load off.  Kids on their lap will be optional.
