C, Biden Struggles On, John Hinderaker, 2021-05-06, As “president” poor decrepit Joe Biden can’t entirely avoid public appearances as he pretty much did during the campaign. But when he tries to speak publicly the results are to put it politely concerning. Here (via PJ Media) Biden tries to read his teleprompter on the “Restaurant Revitalization Fund.” It isn’t pretty: It is obvious I think that Joe Biden has less mental acuity than the average high school student. And unlike the average high school student he is moving in the wrong direction. For how long will our slavish press continue to pretend that this poor fossil is in a meaningful sense our president? Don’t be silly. They will pretend until the day Biden drops. The real question is how long they can continue to fool many Americans? Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
