L, Trump Rages Against 'Saturday Night Live' In Unhinged Conspiracy Rant, Ed Mazza, 2021-06-23, Donald Trump railed against “Saturday Night Live” and actor Alec Baldwin and fueled an unhinged conspiracy theory while attacking a report in The Daily Beast on Tuesday. The website reported that the former president had attempted to sic federal agencies including the Justice Department on late-night comedians who made fun of him. Trump called the story “total Fake News” but added that “Baldwin has no talent certainly when it comes to imitating me.” Trump added that late-night comedy was an “illegal campaign contribution” to Democrats.  But it was the conclusion of his message where Trump really went off the rails. Trump closed his statement with “2024 or before!” ― a nod to a conspiracy theory that claims he will overthrow the elected government and again take office before the next election in 2024. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel mocked Trump as “President Snowflake” over the report while “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert called Trump’s alleged actions “dangerous disturbing un-American.”  On Twitter critics had much the same reaction:  Pathetic. Abuse of power. Trump asked Justice to look into SNL: report https://t.co/OMAYdUhYPz Donald Trump reportedly tried to pressure the Department of Justice to stop Saturday Night Live from mocking him. It sounds ridiculous but it is another example of his attempt to use all powers of the federal government for his personal benefit.https://t.co/dPeznRfLIg I love how Trump screams that @swin24 and @arawnsley's SNL story is "Fake News" before saying he totally thinks the DoJ should investigate the "100% one-sided shows." pic.twitter.com/ZgboBcJAOW What a baby.“Trump Wanted His Justice Department to Stop ‘SNL’ From Teasing Him” @thedailybeast https://t.co/ab1bi38Elr The unquestioned leader of the Republican Party is a lawless delusional black hole of self-pity insecurity and cruelty.

"2024 or before!" pic.twitter.com/KM5Nf9HRJx 2024...or before? Is this the QAnon conspiracy theory that Trump is planning a day of reckoning known as the "Storm" when thousands of members of the deep state cabal will be arrested and he will return to power? pic.twitter.com/uTJuDz66z3 “2024 or before” at what point do we say that trump is planning another coup exactly? https://t.co/y73HwCScse SNL to mock Trump for Trump wanting DOJ and FCC to investigate SNL for mocking him.
