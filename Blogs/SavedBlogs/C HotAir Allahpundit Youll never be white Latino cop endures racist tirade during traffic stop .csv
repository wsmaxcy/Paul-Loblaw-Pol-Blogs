C, "You'll never be white": Latino cop endures racist tirade during traffic stop , Allahpundit, 2021-05-04, An overnight viral sensation with nearly four million views as I write this at 10:30 a.m. ET. Partly that’s due to the power of Fox News which ran the video during Tucker Carlson’s show. And partly it’s because the many people who sympathize with cops for what they endure in an average day wanted to show off the professionalism of one officer in a stressful situation. Normally when footage of traffic stops gets public attention it’s because the police abused the driver. Not this time. Rather the opposite. But mainly it’s gone viral because the woman who was stopped is just *that* obnoxious. You have to see it to believe it. Can you guess in advance what she does for a living? Right: LASD also tells me the woman has a history of making false complaints against deputies.I’ve learned what her name is and she has been a professor at schools in the LA area but at this time I will not be identifying her because she has not returned any of my calls or emails. — Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) May 3 2021   The woman reportedly filed a complaint against the deputy after the incident accusing him of harassment. Unless the footage below has been *very* selectively edited there’s only one person who’s guilty of harassment and it ain’t him. As far as we can tell he didn’t even ring her up for driving without a license just for being on her phone while behind the wheel. If I were her I’d be dialing up Melugin and begging him not to continue reporting on this. If he does she’s going to be Internet-famous. And being Internet-famous is almost always a very bad thing. Anyway give this guy a promotion. NEW: "You're always gonna be a Mexican you'll never be white you know that?"A Latino LASD deputy sent me his bodycam video of a woman claiming to be a teacher launching into a racist tirade against him when he pulled her over in San Dimas. She repeatedly calls him a murderer. pic.twitter.com/Cc8jSVenCQ — Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) May 3 2021
