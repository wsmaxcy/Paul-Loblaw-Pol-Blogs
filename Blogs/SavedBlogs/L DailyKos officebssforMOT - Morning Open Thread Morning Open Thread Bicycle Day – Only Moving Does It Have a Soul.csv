On April 19 1943 chemist Albert Hofman who worked for Sandoz in Bazel Switzerland ingested a minute amount—just 250 micrograms--of a compound derived from the ergot fungus. He soon felt so disoriented that as he rode his bicycle home Hofman experienced all the heavenly and hellish effects of lysergic acid diethylamide. Hofmann's discovery of the effects of LSD are now commemorated on April 19th as Bicycle Day. Albert Hofman described several decades later by a journalist as “a stooped white-haired man with fierce Churchillian mien” contributed not only to our knowledge of LSD but also did pioneering work on Psilocybe cubensis the “magic mushroom” consumed by Indians in Mexico and deduced that its primary active ingredient is psilocybin. But poets have been “tripping out” long before Hofman’s illuminating journey home on his bicycle. ____________________________ . Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem “Kubla Khan” is one of the most famous examples. It was written in 1797. . . by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Or a vision in a dream. A Fragment.. In Xanadu did Kubla KhanA stately pleasure-dome decree:Where Alph the sacred river ranThrough caverns measureless to man  Down to a sunless sea.So twice five miles of fertile groundWith walls and towers were girdled round;And there were gardens bright with sinuous rillsWhere blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;And here were forests ancient as the hillsEnfolding sunny spots of greenery.. But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!A savage place! as holy and enchantedAs e’er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon-lover!And from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seethingAs if this earth in fast thick pants were breathingA mighty fountain momently was forced:Amid whose swift half-intermitted burstHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hailOr chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:And mid these dancing rocks at once and everIt flung up momently the sacred river.Five miles meandering with a mazy motionThrough wood and dale the sacred river ranThen reached the caverns measureless to manAnd sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from farAncestral voices prophesying war!  The shadow of the dome of pleasure  Floated midway on the waves;  Where was heard the mingled measure  From the fountain and the caves.It was a miracle of rare deviceA sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!.   A damsel with a dulcimer  In a vision once I saw:  It was an Abyssinian maid  And on her dulcimer she played  Singing of Mount Abora.  Could I revive within me  Her symphony and song  To such a deep delight ’twould win meThat with music loud and longI would build that dome in airThat sunny dome! those caves of ice!And all who heard should see them thereAnd all should cry Beware! Beware!His flashing eyes his floating hair!Weave a circle round him thriceAnd close your eyes with holy dreadFor he on honey-dew hath fedAnd drunk the milk of Paradise.. “Kubla Khan” from Samuel Taylor Coleridge: The Complete Poems – Penguin Classics 1997 edition Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) English poet literary critic philosopher and theologian; co-founder with William Wordsworth of the Romantic Movement in English letters and one of the Lake Poets (a subgroup of the Romantics who all lived in the beautiful Lake District in North West England). Best known for his poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan but his critical work on William Shakespeare was highly influential while his philosophical and theological writings were an inspiration to Ralph Waldo Emerson and American transcendentalism. ____________________________ . Edgar Allan Poe was the master of the macabre both in poetry and prose and his visions seemed to hover at the edge of madness – and sometimes to venture beyond the edge. He used his poem “The Conqueror Worm” in his short story “Ligeia” as the last composition of the title character while in her death throes. . . by Edgar Allan Poe . Lo! ’t is a gala night  Within the lonesome latter years!  An angel throng bewinged bedight  In veils and drowned in tears  Sit in a theatre to see  A play of hopes and fearsWhile the orchestra breathes fitfully    The music of the spheres.. Mimes in the form of God on high  Mutter and mumble lowAnd hither and thither fly—  Mere puppets they who come and go  At bidding of vast formless things  That shift the scenery to and froFlapping from out their Condor wings  Invisible Wo!. That motley drama—oh be sure    It shall not be forgot!With its Phantom chased for evermore    By a crowd that seize it notThrough a circle that ever returneth in    To the self-same spotAnd much of Madness and more of Sin    And Horror the soul of the plot.. But see amid the mimic rout  A crawling shape intrude!A blood-red thing that writhes from out    The scenic solitude!It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs  The mimes become its foodAnd seraphs sob at vermin fangs  In human gore imbued.. Out—out are the lights—out all!  And over each quivering formThe curtain a funeral pall  Comes down with the rush of a storm  While the angels all pallid and wan    Uprising unveiling affirmThat the play is the tragedy “Man”    And its hero the Conqueror Worm.. “The Conqueror Worm” from The Complete Poems and Stories of Edgar Allan Poe – Doubleday 1966 edition Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) American writer poet editor literary critic and central figure in American Romanticism; he was a pioneer in popularizing the short story known particularly for his tales of mystery and the macabre and poems like “The Raven.” He died at age 40 in 1849 after being found delirious on the streets of Baltimore. An anonymous “memoir” signed “Ludwig” was printed in the New York Tribune on the day of Poe’s burial and reprinted in newspapers across the country. It was written by his literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold and filled with falsehoods which are the main source for the image of Poe as a depraved drug-and-alcohol-addicted madman wandering the streets and muttering to himself. Though Poe was known as a drinker his friends disputed that he was a drug user.  After Poe’s death Griswold bizarrely claimed that he was Poe’s literary executor as he continued until his own death to inflict the maximum damage on Poe’s reputation.  ____________________________ . Advancing into the 20th century Susan Ludvigson gives us this poem which may change how you look at fruit. . . by Susan Ludvigson . Special powers were attributed to the orange inRenaissance England Italy and Sicily. It wasbelieved witches could bring death to an enemyby pinning the victim’s name to an orange andleaving the orange in the chimney. . When he comes in late againthe whole house smells wonderfulbut he can’t quite recognize the scent.The fire is almost out a few ashesflicker in the absent lightand suddenly he recallshis mother holding orange peelsover a flame the singed skincurling back like petalsreleasing the fragrance.She did it daily all one winterjust for the pleasure. . He doesn’t see on the hearththe remains of paper tracesof his name printed in clearblack ink. He wonders how his wifeknew about sweetening their roomswith oranges wonders whether it meansthe air is clearedshe wants to make up.He breathes the evening inImagining her in bed waiting for himforgiveness on her lipslike the taste of oranges. . “After He Called Her a Witch”– from Poetry magazine November 1982 © 1982 by Susan Ludvigson Susan Ludvigson (1942 – )  American poet born in Wisconsin; professor emeritus of English at Winthrop University in Rock Hill South Carolina.
