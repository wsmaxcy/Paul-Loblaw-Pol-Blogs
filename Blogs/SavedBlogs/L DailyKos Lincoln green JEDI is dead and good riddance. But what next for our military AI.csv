L, JEDI is dead and good riddance. But what next for our military AI?, Lincoln green, 2021-07-06, The Defense Department has canceled its $10 billion contract with Microsoft for a Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI). The contract was originally awarded in 2019 and has been tied up in the courts ever since due to claims by Amazon that Donald Trump influenced the decision to award the contract to Microsoft. (Amazon was run by Jeff Bezos who Trump considered an enemy and personally attacked among other things calling him “Jeff Bozo”.) The Defense Dept. said that the contract was cancelled because the JEDI technology has become obsolete — although most computer technology becomes obsolete rapidly so this may be a face-saving gesture. Also supply-chain attacks such as the recent Kaseya ransomware attack have made the Pentagon more leery about relying on a single cloud-computing supplier. In “The Pentagon cancels its $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract” the NY Times’s Kate Conger and David E. Sanger report that the Pentagon has settled on a replacement cloud architecture called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC) which will be implemented via indefinite-delivery and indefinite-quantity contracts that will go to multiple suppliers — who almost surely will be Amazon and Microsoft as the feds say Google IBM etc. are not up to the job. (Felix Richter of Statistica reports that the world’s top five cloud suppliers are Amazon Microsoft Google Alibaba and IBM; of course it’s unlikely the Pentagon would rely on Chinese suppliers like Alibaba.) JEDI was a complete disaster that came on Trump’s watch the disaster was at least partly due to Trump’s own actions and from the military’s point of view JWCC will have to be an improvement. If my job were to defend the United States our lack of cloud-computing support would be high on my list of things to worry about; quite possibly the Chinese or even the Russian militaries are ahead of us in this important technology. In “Pentagon cancels JEDI Cloud contract after years of contentious litigation” FNN’s Jared Serbu reports that actual work on JWCC won’t start until April 2022 at the earliest and if I were in the military I’d say we’re wayyyy late to this party. Conversely were I an enemy of the United States JWCC would be high on my list of computer systems to penetrate.  JWCC systems will likely be attacked successfully perhaps by Russia or China or perhaps by domestic extremists with military connections. When this happens it could be bad news indeed. Among other things the Defense Dept. is planning to do much of its artificial-intelligence computing in the cloud. If foreign powers or domestic extremists gain power over our military’s AIs there’s no telling what could happen.
