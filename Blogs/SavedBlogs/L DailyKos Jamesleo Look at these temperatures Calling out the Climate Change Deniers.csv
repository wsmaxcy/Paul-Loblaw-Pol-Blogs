L, Look at these temperatures: Calling out the Climate Change Deniers, Jamesleo, 2021-06-29, www.scientificamerican.com/… From the article: A blistering heat wave obliterated high temperature records in Oregon and Washington over the weekend ratcheting up risks for deaths and fires and underscoring the dangers of climate change. Portland Oregon’s biggest city hit a sweltering all-time high of 112 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday at its international airport the National Weather Service said. That broke a record of 108 F set just a day earlier. Both days topped the previous record of 107 F reached in 1981 and 1965. The temperature in Salem Oregon’s capital soared to 113 F yesterday I have not seen any reports of deaths (yet). I have seen no reports of changing public opinion regarding the urgency of “Climate Change” But AOC did  call out Marjorie Taylor Greene for her climate denier politics Hey MTG “How’s that Climate Change Denying working out for you” When is it time to hit the airwaves “Hey folks this is a warning of the future” Call out MTG Jim  Inhoffe and the entire GOP. I am  assuming we will never reach the die hard Trump Voter but I imagine many independents venturing outside must be a little nervous at the long term prospects . I don’t have a crystal ball   but if the summer of 2022 is anything the summer of 2021 there will be an issue that will dominate all others.”De fund the Police” “Critical Race Theory will be forgotten.  If the Republicans offer an alternative plan to anything throw it in their faces that have been denying this catastrophe  for the past few decades Damn  we need fighters and communicators We suck at messaging We are terrible at talking points That hast to change
