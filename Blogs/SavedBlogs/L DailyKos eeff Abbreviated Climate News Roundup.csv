L, Abbreviated Climate News Roundup, eeff, 2021-06-30, I’m thinking about doing this two times a week it will also work as a mid day open thread to share the news tweets & pictures. Greg Dworkin posted this link on wet bulb temperature. it is important to understand this. Dangerous humid heat extremes occurring decades before expected Oppressively hot summer days often evoke the expression “it’s not the heat it’s the humidity.” That sticky tropical-like air combined with high temperatures is more than unpleasant — it makes extreme heat a greater health risk. Climate models project that combinations of heat and humidity could reach deadly thresholds for anyone spending several hours outdoors by the end of the 21st century. However new research says these extremes are already happening — decades before anticipated — due to global warming to date.   The study “The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance” published today in Science Advances shows for the first time that some locations have already reported combined heat and humidity extremes above humans’ survivability limit. Dangerous extremes only a few degrees below this limit have occurred thousands of times globally — including in parts of the southwestern and southeastern United States — and have more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Once again: heat records are usually broken by tenths of a degree - not 4.6°C. We're in a climate emergency that has never once been treated as an emergency. #FaceTheClimateEmergency https://t.co/2ueyNqOnZT  I'll be talking about the western U.S. "heat dome" and the role climate change is playing with @AymanM today on @MSNBC (~3:35 PM ET) TODAY: https://t.co/srzB9X99dX  Framing the Case for Ecocide Law - @Katie_Surma @insideclimate on Bolsonaro #indigenous suffering legal battles & the Amazon:   “We’ll never have true justice for his crimes if the International Criminal Court doesn’t act”Ana Alfinito - @amazonwatch https://t.co/szQ7DdM50z  Indigenous Leaders and Human Rights Groups in Brazil Want Bolsonaro Prosecuted for Crimes Against Humanity On a Tuesday afternoon in late March 2020 Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara was killed by gunmen as he was driving a motorbike near his home village on the Araribóia reservation in Maranhao Brazil. A member of the Guajajara tribe he had worked for years to protect land in the Amazon belonging to his ancestors and other uncontacted or isolated tribes. For Zezico fending off illegal incursions had become increasingly dangerous as emboldened logging and mining groups targeted him and other Indigenous environmental activists. He was the fifth Guajajara to be killed in a five-month period. Indigenous chiefs and human rights organizations have linked such killings to a “state policy” implemented by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to “plunder the wealth of the Amazon” and asked the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into whether the actions of the far-right leader and other top Brazilian officials constitute crimes against humanity.  A leaked UN report warns of coming unlivable heat waves widespread hunger and drought rising sea levels and extinction. https://t.co/bUeAsJ6tqo A leaked UN report warns ‘worst is yet to come’ on climate change. Here’s how you can help A leaked draft report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change paints the starkest picture yet of the accelerating danger caused by human use of coal oil and gas. It warns of coming unlivable heat waves widespread hunger and drought rising sea levels and extinction. To understand the report's warnings William Brangham turns to atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayoe. Big oil and gas kept a dirty secret for decades. Now they may pay the price After a century of wielding extraordinary economic and political power America’s petroleum giants face a reckoning for driving the greatest existential threat of our lifetimes. An unprecedented wave of lawsuits filed by cities and states across the US aim to hold the oil and gas industry to account for the environmental devastation caused by fossil fuels – and covering up what they knew along the way.  Coastal cities struggling to keep rising sea levels at bay midwestern states watching “mega-rains” destroy crops and homes and fishing communities losing catches to warming waters are now demanding the oil conglomerates pay damages and take urgent action to reduce further harm from burning fossil fuels. Climate change: Why action still ignites debate in Australia The orange haze and the smell of smoke will forever be etched in my memory. As the country woke to pictures of red skies destroyed homes and burned koalas in smouldering bushland the climate change debate came to the fore. But this wasn't a scientific debate. It was political and it was partisan. Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not answer questions about the issue while then Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack dismissed climate concerns as those of "raving inner-city lefties". That was my other big memory of my first week in Australia. The leadership - after years of drought and as blazes raged across the east coast - openly throwing doubt on the effects of climate change. This was a tussle at the heart of Australian politics. 'Citizen scientists' spend 18 months in isolation in Norway's Arctic Two women have returned from their journey in the most northern part of Norway’s Arctic where they spent a total of 18 months over the past two years living in isolation to gather data for scientists and research organizations. Sunniva Sorby and Hilde Fålun Strøm describe themselves as “citizen scientists” which Sorby says applies to those who study anything in the world and pass their findings on to scientists. The pair who had planned this project for years lived in a cabin that had no running water and was only powered by solar and wind power. The cabin was located in Norway’s Arctic region of Svalbard where the closest community was 140 kilometres away. The looming Arctic collapse: More than 40% of north Russian buildings are starting to crumble Thawing permafrost is poised to cause huge damage to buildings and infrastructure across the country as previously solid ground is quickly degrading warns Russia’s natural resource minister. This week the temperatures in the Russian north again beat records. In Saskylah a small community in the Arctic Circle the air temperature reached 31.9 degrees Celsius the highest measurement since 1936. According to Roshydromet the Russian meteorology institute average temperatures along parts of the Russian Arctic coast have since 1998 increased by as much as 4.95 degrees C. The development is of growing concern in Moscow. The Russian Minister of Natural Resources Aleksandr Kozlov confirms that more than 40 percent of all buildings in the Russian North are now experiencing deformation in their building structure. And the construction of roads and railways is getting increasingly difficult he said in a round table discussion in late May. According to Kozlov the melting ground is today the underlying reason for 23 percent of all technical system failure in the region and up to 29 percent of oil and gas production facilities can no longer be operated.  The unprecedented U.S. heat wave that slammed Seattle and Portland Oregon moved inland Tuesday - prompting an electrical utility in Spokane Washington to warn that people will face more rolling blackouts amid heavy power demand. #climate @APNews https://t.co/5H5b4B3Ubx Blackouts in US Northwest due to heat wave deaths reported The unprecedented Northwest U.S. heat wave that slammed Seattle and Portland Oregon moved inland Tuesday — prompting a electrical utility in Spokane Washington to resume rolling blackouts amid heavy power demand. Officials said a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon may be tied to the intense heat that began late last week. The dangerous weather that gave Seattle and Portland consecutive days of record high temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celcius) was expected to ease in those cities. But inland Spokane saw temperatures spike. The National Weather Service said the mercury reached 109 F (42.2 C) in Spokane— the highest temperature ever recorded there. About 9300 Avista Utilities customers in Spokane lost power on Monday and the company said more planned blackouts began on Tuesday afternoon in the city of about 220000 people.  Ideas to dim the sun 'ignore the root cause' of the #climate crisis – and create a cascade of unintended problems scientists and activists say.  https://t.co/naBlrJneOR Solar geoengineering: Scientists decry a 'foolish' idea The idea sounds preposterous straight out of a Ray Bradbury novel: Tint the planet's atmosphere so the sun's rays bounce back into space instead of heating a planet growing increasingly warmer via fossil fuel emissions. But the idea is gaining steam among some political leaders and scientists as global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fail and the effects of climate change are increasingly felt around the world. A group of scientists social justice advocates Indigenous leaders and youth on Wednesday decried the concept saying the technology would widen disparities between global haves and have-nots leave humanity exposed to even greater problems in the future and tinker with a complex essential system – our atmosphere – without fully understanding the consequences.  Our planet deserves a fighting chance – and this law could help protect it. https://t.co/3YTaHYHJE4  How 165 Words Could Make Mass Environmental Destruction An International Crime Mass environmental destruction known as ecocide would become an international crime similar to genocide and war crimes under a proposed new legal definition. The definition's unveiling last week by a panel of 12 lawyers from around the world marks a big first step in the global campaign's efforts to prevent future environmental disasters like the deforestation of the Amazon or actions that contribute to climate change. There are currently four core international crimes: genocide war crimes crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. These crimes are dealt with by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Greenpeace the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) BirdLife Friends of the Earth Europe and the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) lambasted the provisional agreement - agreed on Friday- and said it turns a blind on the climate and biodiversity crises. "This CAP reform is unfortunately a big failure: a failure for citizens for taxpayers for the planet for climate and even for farmers for those small farmers which are facing problems to get to the end of the month those who are disappearing at the rate of 1000 a day" Marco Contiero policy director on agriculture at Greenpeace EU told Euronews.
