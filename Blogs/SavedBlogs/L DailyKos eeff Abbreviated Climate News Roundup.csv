L, Abbreviated Climate News Roundup, eeff, 2021-07-07, I offer these stories on the Climate Crisis. https://t.co/u8wp8urrvB This is an excellent piece Meteor Blades has posted Sixty years of climate change warnings: the signs that were missed (and ignored) In August 1974 the CIA produced a study on “climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems”. The diagnosis was dramatic. It warned of the emergence of a new era of weird weather leading to political unrest and mass migration (which in turn would cause more unrest). The new era the agency imagined wasn’t necessarily one of hotter temperatures; the CIA had heard from scientists warning of global cooling as well as warming. But the direction in which the thermometer was travelling wasn’t their immediate concern; it was the political impact. They knew that the so-called “little ice age” a series of cold snaps between roughly 1350 and 1850 had brought not only drought and famine but also war – and so could these new climatic changes. “The climate change began in 1960” the report’s first page informs us “but no one including the climatologists recognised it.” Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. The US shipped grain to India and the Soviets killed off livestock to eat “and premier Nikita Khrushchev was quietly deposed”.  But the report argued the world ignored this warning as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy technology and medicine. Melting tropical glaciers sound an early warning The world’s remotest water towers are in retreat. The snows of Kilimanjaro in Africa are diminishing: between 1986 and 2017 the area of ice that crowns the most famous mountain in Tanzania has decreased by 71%. A tropical glacier near Puncak Jaya in Papua in Indonesia has lost 93% of its ice in the 38 years from 1980 to 2018. Melting tropical glaciers are together sounding an ominous warning. The frozen summit of Huascarán the highest peak in the tropics in Peru has decreased in area by 19% between 1970 and 2003. In 1976 US scientists first took cores from the ice cap of Quelccaya in the Peruvian Andes: by 2020 around 46% had gone. The darkening summits of the highest tropical mountains have a message for the world about the rate of climate change. “These are in the most remote parts of our planet − they’re not next to big cities so you don’t have a local pollution effect” said Lonnie Thompson of Ohio University. Besame posted this tweet in a comment the article is very interesting. Lichens fireweed alders and salmon are likely to be early arrivals in the new habitat that will be exposed by the retreating Taku Glacier.https://t.co/YGKPsYxAsx The Mighty Taku Glacier Takes a Bow In a world of shrinking glaciers that yet another is melting hardly seems newsworthy. But the imminent retreat of the massive Taku Glacier near Juneau Alaska which until recently was still growing is an exception. And while it does mark another unhappy milestone in the ongoing climate crisis it also prompts thinking about how the glacier’s retreat will soon reshape the ecology of the Taku River valley. Paradoxical to its grim associations the shrinking of the Taku Glacier will create new habitat for local wildlife and bring fresh opportunities for recreation and science. The Taku Glacier called T’aaḵú Ḵwáan Sít’i in the Tlingit language lies within the traditional homeland of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation. Winding 55 kilometers from the Juneau Icefield the glacier forms a sprawling lobe beside the mouth of the Taku River a biologically abundant waterway that cleaves its way to the Alaska coast from the mountains of British Columbia. Although the glacier has retreated in past centuries it has been steadily advancing since the late 19th century. This makes the Taku an outlier among North America’s coastal glaciers. As most of its counterparts shed ice throughout the 20th century the Taku steadily added girth. Like an ice-age holdout it buried a deep-water fjord and swelled up against steep mountainsides obliterating ancient coastal rainforest. At its leading edge it shoved sediment into a moraine nine kilometers across. The debris buried the glacier’s nose and on its surface new plants and trees sprouted—even as the ice continued to push them toward the edge of the Taku River.  ⚠️"Tipping could be imminent"'Tipping found in models of the Gulf Stream and North American mid-latitude wind systems add to the growing concern that anthropogenic climate change might be abrupt and irreversible'#ClimateEmergency #ClimateCrisis #NEWShttps://t.co/cS1QhcJp34 Studies add to concern about climate tipping Two model studies document the probability of climate tipping in Earth subsystems. The findings support the urgency of restricting CO2 emissions as abrupt climate changes might be less predictable and more widespread in the climate system than anticipated. The work is part of the European TiPES project coordinated by the University of Copenhagen Denmark but was conducted by Professor Michael Ghil Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris France and coauthours from The Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium and Parthenope University of Naples Italy. Tipping could be imminent It is often assumed climate change will proceed gradually as we increase the amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Over the last 15 years however it has become increasingly clear that the Earth's climate system or subsystems thereof - such as sea ice cover monsoon systems and ocean currents - might shift abruptly and with little warning as CO2 levels go up. This is known as climate tipping. Two studies from the European TiPES project now add to the evidence that tipping could be imminent and might be more widespread in the climate system than usually anticipated. Hydrothermal vents may add ancient carbon to ocean waters Earth's oceans play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle. As seawater moves and mixes it stores and transports huge amounts of carbon in the form of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon molecules. However the various sources and fates of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are complex and much remains to be learned about its dynamics—especially as climate change progresses. Carbon isotope ratios can help determine the age of DOC which gives clues to its source and journey through the carbon cycle. Photosynthetic organisms in surface waters are thought to produce most marine DOC but radiocarbon dating shows that marine DOC is thousands of years old so more information is needed to clarify how it mixes and lingers in the ocean. Relying on radiocarbon dating of seawater samples collected during a research cruise in 2016–2017 Druffel et al. provide new insights into DOC dynamics in the eastern Pacific and Southern Oceans. Their investigation lends support to a hypothesis that hydrothermal vents could be an important source of DOC in this region. More carbon dioxide will dry world’s rainforests Brazilian scientists have identified a new way to take the rain out of the rainforest. All the world has to do is to make sure more carbon dioxide reaches the trees − half as much again as today. The effect will be stark: it will be roughly the same as if Brazil’s business leaders politicians and farmers cleared the entire Amazon rainforest and replaced it with cattle pasture. As climate scientists have been pointing out for years both processes seem to be happening anyway. The region is already experiencing fire and drought as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. And great tracts of the forest are being destroyed degraded or felled in pursuit of land for soya or beef. What is new is the confirmation that extra carbon dioxide can itself affect the levels of rainfall on the canopy. Arctic’s coldest sea ice is vulnerable to melting The frozen world is dwindling fast. New research suggests that the cryosphere − the area of the planet covered by snow and ice − is dwindling by around 87000 square kilometres every year. This is an area bigger than Austria almost as big as Hungary or Jordan. Even the Arctic’s coldest sea ice is threatened. A second separate study warns that what glacier scientists call the Last Ice Refuge − the tract of Arctic Ocean that will stay frozen when the rest of it becomes open water during some summers in the next decades − is itself at risk: the coldest and most secure reaches of sea ice just north of Greenland and Canada could be vulnerable to summer melt. That the polar regions and the high-altitude frozen rivers and lakes are at risk is not news: climate scientists have been warning for decades of accelerating melt in Antarctica ever-higher losses of ice mass from Greenland and a loss of northern polar sea ice so comprehensive that by 2050 much of the Arctic Ocean could be clear blue water most summers. Huge Methane Leak Spotted in Heart of China’s Top Coal Hub A massive plume of methane the potent greenhouse gas that’s a key contributor to global warming has been identified in China’s biggest coal production region. The release in northeast Shanxi province is one of the largest that geoanalytics company Kayrros SAS has so far attributed to the global coal sector and likely emanated from multiple mining operations. Details captured in European Space Agency satellite data show the plume about 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of Shanxi’s capital Taiyuan in Yangquan City. The area has 34 coals mines according to the Shanxi Energy Bureau. A quarter of the UK's homes sit above abandoned coal mines long since flooded with water. Now the mines are being put to a new zero-carbon use. Coal mines were the beating heart of Britain's industrial revolution. Their sooty energy-dense output gave life to new-fangled factories and shipyards fuelling the nation's march towards modernity. They helped shape a carbon-intensive economy one that took little notice of the natural world around it. The mines paved the way for a global dependence on fossil fuels and in doing so fired the starting pistol on the climate crisis that today confronts us all.   But what if in a serendipitous circle of history our extractive past could be repurposed for a greener cleaner future? What if the vast maze of coal mines beneath our feet now filled with naturally warm water could help decarbonise the UK's – and the world's – herculean heating needs? That's the question Adam Black a renewable energy enthusiast employed by one of Britain's largest bottling firms asked himself a decade ago. Solar Is Dirt-Cheap and About to Get Even More Powerful The solar industry has spent decades slashing the cost of generating electricity direct from the sun. Now it’s focusing on making panels even more powerful. With savings in equipment manufacturing hitting a plateau and more recently pressured by rising prices of raw materials producers are stepping up work on advances in technology — building better components and employing increasingly sophisticated designs to generate more electricity from the same-sized solar farms. “The first 20 years in the 21st century saw huge reductions in module prices but the speed of the reduction started to level off noticeably in the past two years” said Xiaojing Sun global solar research leader at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Fortunately new technologies will create further cost-of-electricity reductions.”  Newcastle and Humber wind power factory investment to create 1000 jobs https://t.co/IJNY0gqf64 Wind power: Newcastle and Humber investment to create 1000 jobs A South Korean company will create 750 new jobs in North Lincolnshire by building a £117m factory to make supports for turbines. In Newcastle a site in Wallsend will see a £70m investment safeguarding 325 jobs and creating some more. The funding has come from government grants and private sector investment. Rob Waltham Conservative leader of North Lincolnshire Council said the new factory showed the government's confidence in the region.  Siemens Gamesa’s Offshore Wind Turbine Gets ‘Typhoon-resistant’ Certificate https://t.co/PwUbC2M8Ek Siemens Gamesa’s Offshore Wind Turbine Gets ‘Typhoon-resistant’ Certificate Wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa’s offshore wind turbine SG 11.0-200 DD has received a typhoon-resistant type certificate from TÜV NORD a trait especially important for the growing offshore wind ambitions in Asia. The wind turbine type is able to withstand Typhoon- or T-class wind speeds as determined by the IEC reaching 57 meters per second for 10 minutes and three-second gusts of up to 79.8 meters per second. “We are driven to ensure that our turbines can sustain the extreme weather events such as typhoons seen in Asia Pacific. We’re thus tremendously proud to have received this second rotor-nacelle assembly-type certification. With the region poised to become even more significant globally it strengthens our focus on delivering value to our customers” says Marc Becker CEO of the Siemens Gamesa Offshore Business Unit.  From the historic heat wave tearing through the Pacific Northwest to temperatures "too hot for humanity" in Pakistan the consequences of #climate change are no longer a far-off threat — they're here right now. @jacobin https://t.co/IQb2sJxcI1 Climate Change Disaster Isn’t a Future Threat — It’s Already Here British Columbia Canada reaches so far into the north of our globe that I once saw the northern lights close to its border with the Yukon. Canada’s geography perhaps makes it all the more stark that its recent heat wave has seen approximately three hundred excess deaths amid temperature highs of 49.5°C (121.3°F). Many of the dead were elderly and living alone in unventilated homes. Shocking moments like this now a more than annual occurrence can jolt us into a renewed sense of urgency to do something about climate change. Undoubtedly Canada’s heat wave has garnered such attention in the Global North because it is a major economy predominantly English-speaking and largely white. We must not ignore the realities of extreme heat in parts of the world even more vulnerable to climate change’s impacts.  #Climate activists and their Dem allies in Congress are pressing with renewed urgency for huge investments to slow global warming after a bipartisan infrastructure plan cut out some of President Biden's key climate initiatives. #infrastructure @APNews https://t.co/5jJZZZJpUu New infrastructure deal must focus on climate activists say Climate activists and their Democratic allies in Congress are pressing with renewed urgency for huge investments to slow global warming after a bipartisan infrastructure plan cut out some of President Joe Biden’s key climate initiatives. Supporters say a larger Democratic-only package now being developed in Congress must meet Biden’s promise to move the country toward carbon-free electricity make America a global leader in electric vehicles and create millions of jobs in solar wind and other clean- energy industries. But passage of a larger multitrillion-dollar bill faces significant hurdles even if Democrats use a procedural method that requires only a simple majority. It’s far from certain in an evenly divided Senate that moderate Democrats will agree to an expansive measure that could swell to as high as $6 trillion.
