L, A great quote, T100R, 2021-05-09, This is not really a diary but I just ran across this quote from Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill) one of the few Anti-Trumpers left in the GQP in an article in TheHill and I had to share it: “Right now it's basically the Titanic. We're like you know in this in the middle of this slow sink we have a band playing on the deck telling everybody it's fine. And meanwhile as I've said you know Donald Trump's running around trying to find women's clothing and get on the first lifeboat” Kinzger said. (Misspelling in the original). What a great image that is.
