L, Talking To The Unvaccinated, sufeitzy, 2021-06-27, How does a Black Man convince KKK members to quit? By talking and listening. That’s how we will convince the Unvaccinated to become Vaccinated. People react badly here on Kos when I point out the simple truth that demonizing the poor and poorly educated for vaccine hesitancy for ridiculing  and savoring intimations of the death of Republicans is not a productive progressive strategy.   Helping people to get informed by people they trust in language they understand to make better decisions is the only real way to make health progress where it isn’t happening.   Ridiculing and punishing along with smug condescension are not attractive or winning positions and don’t change the balance of the equation in favor of community health.  In today’s New York Times there is an excellent op-Ed by Nicholas Kristof about persuasion strategies for people who want to be part of the solution not calling cheap shots from the sidelines. It’s about Daryl Davis a Black Man who listened and spoke to virulent KKK members and convinced them to quit and re-enter the human race.  One of Davis’s methods — and there’s researchfrom social psychology to confirm the effectiveness of this approach — is not to confront antagonists and denounce their bigotry but rather to start in listening mode. Once people feel they are being listened to he says it is easier to plant a seed of doubt. It is not the job of Black People to educate White People about racism; it’s not the job of Vaccinated Progressives to overcome Vaccine Hesitation. But it is in all our best interests to learn how to be better advocates for progressive positions with those who don’t share our views. And when the occasion arises be thoughtful tolerant motivators for people to make better decisions in life. Davis’s approach seems out of step with modern sensibilities. Today the more common impulse is to decry from a distance. It takes time and energy to build a better world not just being a backseat driver.  Your mileage may vary.
