C, How Woke Media Becomes Broke Media, Steven Hayward, 2021-03-23, As we noted at some length around the time the 1619 Project debuted some of the strongest criticism of it came from the World Socialist Web Site which sees identity politics as a hindrance to old-fashioned orthodox Marxist class-conscious revolution. And they might be on to something here. It really is tempting to see the whole domain of identity politics as a right-wing plot to get the left to commit ritual purity suicide. (Do I really mean this? To quote Francis Urquhart in the original—and best—House of Cards: “You might very well think so; I couldn’t possibly comment.” I know Steve Bannon was cheerleading for identity politics to take root in the Democratic Party.) Well check out the latest from Freddie deBoer who is a far-left writer most often for the uber-socialist magazine Jacobin. First he provides these heart-warming statistics (from Pew) about what is happening to the news media: As I say who says there isn’t any good news these days? Then deBoer—a leftist remember—goes on to offer this explanation for a big reason the major media is collapsing: In the span of a decade or so essentially all professional media not explicitly branded as conservative has been taken over by a school of politics that emerged from humanities departments at elite universities and began colonizing the college educated through social media. Those politics are obscure they are confusing they are socially and culturally extreme they are expressed in a bizarre vocabulary they are deeply alienating to many and they are very unpopular by any definition. The vast majority of the country is not woke including the vast majority of women and people of color. How could it possibly be healthy for the entire media industry to be captured by any single niche political movement let alone one that nobody likes? Why does no one in media seem willing to have an honest uncomfortable conversation about the near-total takeover of their industry by a fringe ideology? And the bizarre assumption of almost everyone in media seems to have been that they could adopt this brand of extreme niche politics in mass as an industry and treat those politics as a crusade that trumps every other journalistic value with no professional or economic consequences. They seem to have thought that Americans were just going to swallow it; they seem to have thought they could paint most of the country as vicious bigots and that their audiences would just come along for the ride. DeBoer has followed a lot of writers to Substack and most of his piece is pushing back against the mainstream media types who hate Substack because it is taking even more of their audience away. Chaser from the Washington Post—for the pure schadenfreude file:  Hat tip: JD. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
