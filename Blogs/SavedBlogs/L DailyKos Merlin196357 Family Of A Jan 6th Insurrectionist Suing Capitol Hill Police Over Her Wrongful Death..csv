L, Family Of A Jan 6th Insurrectionist Suing Capitol Hill Police Over Her "Wrongful Death.", Merlin196357, 2021-05-01, I figured something like this was coming but the family of Ashli Babbit — hero to some political extremists — is suing the Capitol Hill Police for “wrongful death.”  Ashli Babbit was a Jan 6th insurrectionist who was shot once by Capitol Hill Police who were protecting members of Congress.  But her family is now suing the Capitol Hill Police to the tune of $10 million dollars. In my opinion she got what she deserved.  No I’m not into shooting people I disagree with.  But there is video of Babbit along with others smashing the glass door that kept a violent mob away from trapped members of Congress.  This mob had already proven their violent intent by beating hundreds of police officers and breaking into the Capitol Building.  Babbit stuck her head through the shattered glass and one of the officers shot her and killed her. The DOJ says they will not press charges against the officer and this is one time I would like to think that most of us could say that the use of deadly force was justifiable.  But nooooooooooooo.  I have seen on at least one website that Babbit is some kind of martyr to “the cause.”   On social media Babbitt was outspoken about her support for former President Donald Trump. Her Twitter profile was filled with posts about Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) slogan rants about the border wall and attacks on the Democratic Party. Babbitt was also a follower of the fair-right QAnon conspiracy theory – tweeting a day before the riot that “Nothing will stop up. They can try and try and try but the storm is here.” The “storm” is a central theme of the QAnon conspiracy that holds that Trump was eventually going to conduct mass arrests of the pedophilic Satanic child sex-trafficking ring that secretly runs the U.S. government… Babbit’s death sent shockwaves through pro-Trump groups around the country. Some prominent conservatives including Fox News host Tucker Carlson have sought to make Babbitt’s death into a political talking point – just as a Trump supporter who thought the Capitol riot went too far told WUSA9 would happen in January. “It’s just a sad story because people are going to take her and make her a martyr and that incident will radicalize other people” a Trump supporter from San Diego who only wanted to be known by his first name Max told WUSA9. Yeah a woman trying to kill members of Congress is a “sad story” indeed.  Just like everyone thinks its a sad story when someone is trying to break into a place and kill other people especially over a lie.  And trying to destroy democracy to boot. As to what the lawyers in this case are saying about poor old defenseless Ashli Babbit: Earlier this month the Justice Department announced it would not pursue charges against the officer who shot Babbitt saying there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution. “Specifically the investigation revealed no evidence to establish that at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber” the Justice Department said. In a statement on April 14 Roberts pushed back on the Justice Department's decision saying it "plainly glosses over" the facts. "The actual evidence is this: The officer show an unarmed woman who was not an immediate threat to him or any Member of Congress" Roberts said. "That is inconsistent with any claim of self-defense or the defense of others period." Roberts said at the time the decision did not dissuade the family from its goal of "ultimately vindicating Ashli Babbitt's constitutional rights in the civil arena." Emphasis is my doing. Babbit had the “constitutional right” to overturn an election and end democracy in the U.S.?  Where is that in the U.S. constitution??  And Babbit was not an “immediate threat to him or any member of Congress?”  WTF?? Babbit is no hero.  She’s not a martyr.  Babbit was a crazy woman and part of an insurrection.  Conservatives used to say that people should be held accountable for their actions and reap what they sow.  Babbit was a member of a violent mob and a cop had to stop her using deadly force.  She got what she deserved.
