L, Jim Jordan Asked A Snarky Question About Masks And Twitter Users Did Not Hold Back, Lee Moran, 2021-04-20, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) received a series of stinging rebukes for his latest attempt at politicizing coronavirus pandemic public health precautions. “How many masks are we supposed to wear this week?” Jordan a Donald Trump sycophant snarkily asked on Twitter Monday. How many masks are we supposed to wear this week? It followed the Ohio Republican’s viral rant last week at Dr. Anthony Fauci the country’s top infectious diseases expert against government restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages people to wear masks “in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.” Two masks are better than one it advises. Many critics reminded Jordan of the guidance ― and of the 567000 Americans who have died from COVID-19: Enough so that no one can hear you whining. https://t.co/fksz90NCDR You could be part of the Solution but instead you choose to be part of the problem.  The "liberties/freedoms" you were recently screaming about that have been "removed" would be quickly restored if everyone wore masks and got vaccinated. 567000 American lives lost.Jim Jordan: https://t.co/uNQnxuJob8 Ohioans when you're visiting your loved one's grave remember jim jordan was laughing at them https://t.co/oYqgQBZxmF pic.twitter.com/GpEcv7ayya Resign. One mask for every mass shooting. So like 50. There isn’t enough to keep your mouth quiet. I’m sure the family members of your deceased constituents love to see you mocking a disease that’s killed 560000 fellow Americans. You keep doing you though. How about following the advice of scientists and physicians? One day some youngster will ask you how you helped in the terrible Covid pandemic of 2020 and 2021. You will be able to say that I sat on the sidelines and made fun of the people that tried to save our lives and I made sure I voted to stop helping the people financially burdened. Shove a few in your mouth and we’ll all be better off https://t.co/FSt2CbyeRz Just get one muzzle. That should do it. For you Jim so many you can’t open your mouth all week long!
