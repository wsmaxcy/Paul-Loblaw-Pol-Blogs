L, BINGO! Panelist changed question. He scolded America’s willful denial of its white supremacist start, Egberto Willies, 2021-04-18, I thought it was brilliant how panelist @LZGranderson used his last 38-seconds to tell a white supremacist truth we continue to dance around. See full episodes here. Our mainstream media infrastructure does not cater to critical thinking. In fact too often it is anathema to anything but the superficial. America has various underlying problems. Unfortunately it can all be traced to our genesis. Let's be clear no country people ethnicities genders and all the identities that fall within them are pure. They all can list their atrocities. They all have caused pain to others. But the idea that we are still grappling with what really ails this country (and many others) is at best disingenuous. In discussing the America First Caucus LZ Granderson made it clear that a major tenet of the caucus is actually foundational to this country. After all blacks as 3/5 of a person were codified. Read the PDF of their entire platform here. But the paragraph in the America First Caucus shows a complete lack of understanding of who America has become if not what it was supposed to be. America is a nation with a border and a culture strengthened by a common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions. History has shown that societal trust and political unity are threatened when foreign citizens are imported en-masse into a country particularly without institutional support for assimilation and an expansive welfare state to bail them out should they fail to contribute positively to the country. While certain economic and financial interest groups benefit immensely from mass immigration legal as well as illegal and the aggregate output of the country increases the reality of large segments of our society as well as the long-term existential future of America as a unique country with a unique culture and a unique identity being put at unnecessary risk is something our leaders can afford to ignore no longer. Please listen to the entire clip. I believe it gives a more complete perspective.
