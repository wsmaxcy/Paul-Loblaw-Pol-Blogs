C, A word from Julie Lawson, Scott Johnson, 2021-03-17, Following my last installment of Sunday Morning Coming Down earlier this week I was tickled to receive a message from the widow of Persuasions lead singer Jerry Lawson. Her name is Julie Hurwitz Lawson. Mrs. Lawson wrote (and I am publishing it here with her permission): Dear Scott I read your personal playlist and was so tickled that you included The Persuasions. Their lead singer producer and arranger for 40 years and 22 albums was my late husband of 44 years… Jerry Lawson.  I don’t often meet new people. Especially people who know Jerry’s music.  What surprises me is that I have yet to meet a Persuasions fan who has heard or even knows that Jerry made a couple dozen albums.  After leaving The Persuasions in 2003 he made one a cappella album without the Persuasions in 2007: Jerry Lawson & Talk of The Town. Together they were featured on the NBC prime time show The Sing Off.  Then Jerry made his debut as a solo artist with some of Nashville’s best musicians with Jerry Lawson Just A Mortal Man.  And now the documentary about his legacy will air soon on PBS and is being shopped to Netflix and other outlets. 🤞 Though Jerry left the earth 18 months ago it feels like yesterday and my heart is heavy. Not sure if I could ever love another after loving someone like him. (And if you know anyone in radio like Sirius I want to create a Jerry Lawson show.) Thank you Scott for your time here but especially for helping to keep Jerry’s legacy alive through your post. In Harmony

www.thepersuasions.org Julie’s message alludes to the song I posted on Sunday “I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You).” In case you missed it the video is below. Jerry Lawson’s lead vocal is something else. When I was with the Persuasion in their dressing room for a few minutes after their performance at Duffy’s in 1982 it was Jerry who called out “Ain’t That Good News” for them to sing for me. He had more to give. Oh what a night.  Julie added the trailer below for the coming documentary.  The New York Times obituary on Jerry (with more videos) is posted here. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
