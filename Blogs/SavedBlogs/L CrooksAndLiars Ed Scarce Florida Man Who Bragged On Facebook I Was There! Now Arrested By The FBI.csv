John Maron Nassif of Chuluota was charged Monday with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds as well as entering a restricted building without lawful authority. According to his arrest affidavit a witness contacted the FBI three days after the January 6 riot to report that Nassif had posted pictures and videos from inside and outside the Capitol during the riot commenting on one of them "You know I was there right?"
