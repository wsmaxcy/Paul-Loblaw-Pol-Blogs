I’ve never been a mother myself but I’m going with my sister who has all the bone fides of being an actual mother. The actually going inside of a restaurant is a big deal. I haven’t been inside of a restaurant in well over a year. The last time I went inside to a social event was my birthday in March 2020 when I went to play bingo at the casino. Instead of an all day affair I limited it to a couple of hours because I saw Covid was coming. As a retired nurse I had been following the outbreak from China saw our lack of any real national response and knew things would be bad. Really bad. I have been to grocery stores every 2-4 weeks and have been grateful that all the places I shop enforce a strict mask policy. The one I went to 2 weeks ago had a couple of people without masks and when I pointed that out to an employee he dropped his work and went out to look for them.  I’ve been vaccinated and so has my sister brother in law both nephews and nephews’ girlfriend so being at a table with them is OK in a restaurant that practices social distancing and limited capacity. It’s our first time being all together inside in over a year thanks to an abundance of vaccines and an efficient way of distributing them. I see light at the end of the Covid tunnel despite the RWNJ opposition to vaccination. I’m a big believer in using vaccine passports to open up the world to those of us who care enough to get the vaccine. It’s not just about us but about protecting others. Let the rabid Republicans get locked out of travel dining bars hotels and other places people gather because they choose to remain health risks. Maybe then they’ll change their minds and do the right thing. Thanks to tonight's Top Comments contributors! Let us hear from YOU when you find that proficient comment.
