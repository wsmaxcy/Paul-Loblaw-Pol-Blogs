L, Are prime minister Scott Morrison and his federal ministers in Australia really Christians?, Alan Austin, 2021-05-03, Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has always been open about his membership of a prominent Sydney Pentecostal church. His religious faith has made the news in the last few days following his speech at a Pentecostal meeting in Queensland. This has been the subject of wide criticism partly for what he said and partly for billing taxpayers for him to attend a private event.  Morrison claimed in that speech that he was “called to do God’s work” and asked the congregation to “raise up the spiritual weapons” to help him fight the “evil one” who he blamed for "social media" and "identity politics".  Several other federal ministers and influential backbenchers are also Pentecostal Christians. This follows a concerted push by conservative charismatic churchgoers to infiltrate the governing right wing political party curiously misnamed the Liberal Party. Others are practising Anglicans Catholics Jews and adherents of other religious faiths. One key question was addressed today in the progressive online journal Independent Australia: Are the Pentecostal church members in prominent positions in the Morrison Government actually followers of Jesus Christ?  The article asks ‘How can we tell who is a real Christian? Who decides?’ It answers those questions with reference to the foundational Christian texts – what Christians call  the New Testament.  As a  guide the article uses Spanish Jesuit linguist and Vatican theologian Juan Mateos who studied minutely every word of the New Testament in its original Greek and Aramaic to translate it into contemporary Spanish.  False religiosity Mateos identified several prominent religious groups in Judea at the time of Christ. One was the band of followers of Jesus of Nazareth. Another was the Pharisees. Both were devout mostly lay people who believed in a personal God to whom they prayed regularly believed the Jewish scriptures were inspired by God practised personal morality and were dedicated to spreading their faith. Hence many similarities. But there were stark differences. The Pharisees were the sworn enemies of Jesus and were among those who had him executed. Jesus warned his followers of the danger of becoming like the Pharisees. The tension between these two religious traditions has continued throughout Christendom. Critical indicators of who is an isn’t a real Christian The article reflects on the Biblical teaching on support for the rich versus the poor telling the truth and welcoming refugees. Australian readers will be well aware that Scott Morrison has been widely condemned throughout his years as a senior government minister for his harsh and oppressive policies relating to low income workers the unemployed welfare recipients and asylum seekers.
