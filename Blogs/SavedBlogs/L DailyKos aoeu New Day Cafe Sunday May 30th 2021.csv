L, New Day Cafe: Sunday May 30th 2021, aoeu, 2021-05-30, Two days and a wake up and then winter is over for me. I won’t bore you with the hours and I’m not counting the minutes at all but I had my second jab of Moderna two weeks ago Tuesday. I also had the Covid last year before the first lockdown so I haven’t felt at risk for a year. I didn’t complain of or resist the mask orders but I’m done with them now. I carry one and wear it in stores but it comes off when I get to the bike rack. The vaccines work and the epidemic is over for people who have been fully vaccinated. Come on in. New Day Cafe is one of our DailyKos openthreads posting at 07:30 Portland Standard Time. If you have a question or something to say don’t be bashful. Sign up here. Our Rules of the Road are here.  This is my current project and it’s already ridable but still needs  help in the shifting department. I spent a few of my Biden Bucks on new cables but they haven’t come in the mail yet. The front derailleur is a real problem. I don’t have the original. It started out life as a ten-speed which uses an obsolete chain type. In the pic it has a seven gear cogset on a wheel that has a 126mm outer lock nut width which matches the frame. Eight speed cogs are wider and so are the wheels they fit on and the frames they fit in. 130mm is the current standard for ‘road’ bikes and 135mm is standard for ‘mountain’ bikes. I haven’t really decided yet between 6-7-8 speed chain and 9 speed chain. Eight speed clusters nine speed clusters ten speed clusters eleven speed clusters and twelve speed clusters all fit on the same wheels. I plan to cold set the frame for a wider wheel but I haven’t yet. It’s a scary prospect.  ​Time for pie breakfast.  What’s on your mind this morning? We were all new here once so don’t be bashful.  ​
