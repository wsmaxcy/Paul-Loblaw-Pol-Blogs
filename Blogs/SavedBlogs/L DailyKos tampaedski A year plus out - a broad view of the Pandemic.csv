L, A year plus out - a broad view of the Pandemic, tampaedski, 2021-05-09, Only recently have I looked at the world COVID numbers (for what they are worth) and casting aside any uncertainties the USA is no longer a major driver of the pandemic.  While we’re still “hitting over our weight” in baseball terms we’re no longer putting up gaudy numbers. On January 12th of this year the USA had a 7 day moving average (from Worldometer) of over 254000 new cases a day.  The reported world number was about 741000. A couple days ago (5/7) the numbers had quite a different ratio: That is much closer to matching our share of the world population than it has since the pandemic spiraled out of control in this country about 14 months ago. In the last 2 months or so I’ve been following 4 states in addition to the country as a whole and the world — New York Florida Texas and California.  There are large similarities and differences in the story each have endured the rest of the country is certainly NOT the mathematical difference but comparison of these 4 as a unit to the rest of the country might have utility.  The 4 states make up roughly a 1/3 of the country.  Perhaps in the next month I might put together some better proxy groupings but frankly the work required conflicts with my other responsibilities… For the entire pandemic I’ve plotted each of these states’ reported 7 day moving average of new COVID cases below: The different story is clearly NY at the outset and through the summer of 2020 but by Thanksgiving NY was having a surge like most of the rest of the country.  This spring NY also diverged from the nominal script followed by these 4 states as a unit — there was a stubbornly high level of cases in NY through March 2021. Another “different” story is certainly CA — it’s case surge was epic compared to the rest of the country and indeed seems to be the biggest factor in the dramatic drop in daily new cases since mid January worldwide.  The double peak seems likely real to me because unlike TX and FL CA shows little holiday induced variability in the data. Closer to home for me here in FL we’re coming out of a little mini-surge.  We’re contributing about 9% or so of new cases nationally about 50% higher than our approximately 6% of the population.  But the rising tide (or in this case receding pandemic) helps everyone out and those who think Ron DeSantis is doing a good job will never dig into the data or believe anyone who does. Looking at these 4 states as a whole and the remainder of the country shows that these 4 states stopped being the main drivers of the pandemic in this country in late March.  That was about the time Michigan had it’s bad time… Nationally on a more recent time scale we’ve seen about 3 weeks of close to linear decline.  Looking at this extrapolation gives us a “best case” scenario for me to do a little modeling… As some might recall from my other geeky diaries I suspect that recent trends are more closely modeled and predicted using logistic functions.  Taking about a week before this most recent peak I modelled two curves — one based on a 150 day evolution the other 210 days.  The estimates for the rest of the month (with yesterday’s reported number as of now from Worldometer) is below: So this will be the fodder for a diary in about 10 days when the green dots make a definitive curve that can tell us where we are at that point. Stay safe!
