L, Meanwhile in Michigan, brabc1, 2021-05-10, The Detroit Police Chief James Craig announced he’s retiring.  He is an AA. He also announced he is running as a repub for the nomination to run against Governor Whitmer.  That’s right he is going to run in the white supremist repub party.  I have lost all respect for him.
