L, Reimagining Black Communities---Can We?, wayneonly, 2021-04-25, This diary stems from a comment I wrote in a diary by psychusa titled Why Police Reform Will Not Succeed Unless...www.dailykos.com/… It was an excellent diary that unfortunately did not get near enough attention.  I would urge readers to at least check out new diaries from lesser known diarists who don’t get the attention of more popular diarists as there is often new ways of looking at things that need attention. My diary here is to add attention to another idea for consideration in the fight for racial equity and lessening the police violence. From the beginning of slavery to the present day POC have been shuttled into segragated areas. It has kept what many consider the “undesirables” away from the white majority. It has made it easier for the white majority to leave the POC uneducated away from the “privileged” neighberhoods and the “privileged” existance of the majorty whites. It has put the POC in isolation in order to maintain control of them. The isolation of POC into consentration in POC communities from the beginning has caused the police to view these community as “scary” communities. Their training their past expierences or the past expierences of other police have reinforced their idea that they are entering a “scarry” place when they respond to an incident or are even just patroling these areas has put them into a heightened sense of danger to themselves. Their fear tells them they need to act agressively to control any incident. Even the most “macho” of the police carry this fear and it affects how they act to overcome that fear or just act to hide that fear. And their actions are unfortunately mostly aggressive making the situation more “scary” for both them and the POC involved. And that makes the POC community distrust the actions of police and more reluctant to cooperate with the police. Obviously many things need to change in police training and police attitude towards POC community members.  God I wish there was a “quick fix” for the racial disparity the racial bias of police for the fear that POC fear in every police encounter. But there isn’t. Retraining police is just a small part of the bigger problem. Improving the economic health of POC is just another partial solution. Removing racial bias in employment in business and housing oppertunities is just another part in solving the problems. Even changing the racial bias of the majority of the white population is only another part towards solving  the problem. And what I am writing about in the rest of this diary is only a small part of solving the many problems facing this nation and POC especially. This is a comment I started to psychusa”s diary (mentioned at the start of this diary) before I realized that it should be a full diary on it’s own: _______________________________________________  Excellent analysis of the factors that cause the divisions that result in police brutality of minority people and communities. But I would add one thing that I feel nobody is looking at. That is minority communities themselves. So let’s take a look at that problem also. During the slave years negros were housed in mostly sub par housing on plantations. They were isolated from white people except their masters and overlords (the people tasked with making sure they “pulled their weight” in the fields and didn’t get “uppity”). After the Civil War the negros were limited to where they could live relegated to shacks that they could build from whatever scraps they could scavenage. Even when they managed to gain some little piece of land they often were grouped together on the poorest property in the area and often shared it with many others. And they gathered together for safety and just to be with “their own kind”. Even as the negro managed to gain some measure of decent living (I don’t say prosperity because that seldom happened for far too many) they continued to be confined to “their place”. Their place was determined by four factors: 1) Where society would allow them to live. 2) Their collective safety. 3) What their economic status could afford them. 4) The desire to be with their own kind being part of a community that accepted them. (4 was typical of most ethnic groups for a period of time but most other ethnic groups diverged from this as society accepted them and their economic status improved.) We see some small movement of the POC being able to move to diverse neighborhoods as their economic circumstances improve but the economic status and the mobility of the POC still is more limited than most other ethnic groups. How does this relate to the policing issue? Obviously when a police (or group of police) respond to any incident in a predomately black area they are alert (even anticipating) to a hightened possibility of danger to themselves. This is because of their training to consider “the scary black person” and the “scary black neighborhood” as the enemy. It is also evidenced by the fact that police may encounter people of the neighborhood who are both afraid and suspisious of them and possibly even hostile to them. And that fear distrust and hostility works against both sides. Add into this the fact that the POC must live in the neighborhood daily which means they are in danger when they need help from the police against “their own kind”. This causes friction with police actions but the police officer(s) is not focused on understanding they are focused on getting results and going home to their safe neighborhoods. The logical solution to this would be to improve as many aspects of community for POC as possible. But that is a “tall order” and something that could take a generation to accomplish. Again we have the possibility  (and the necessity) for multiple solutions. 1) The first solution would be to improve the economic status of the POC. But it is a long range solution that includes better employment opportunities equality in banking better education opportunities etc.. It can’t be acted on separate from working on other solutions. 2) The location of housing opportunities for POC needs to be improved. But we see so many times middle class neighborhoods resisting the movement of lower income housing into their areas sometimes even miles away. But we need to reimagine the concept of lower income housing. We tend to try to move huge numbers of low income people into small areas with a huge multi-story buildings. This is understandably  “scary” to middle class homeowners for many reasons. So we need to look at making these housing projects smaller and spread over more areas spaced farther apart. And the concept of “low income housing needs” to change from cheap ugly construction surrounded by concrete parking spaces to housing comparable to complexes similar to more of those for higher income levels. Cities could mandate that new housing projects be mandated that these projects have a certain % of units designated for lower income families (minorities) built and maintained at the same standards for all units. The advantage for the cities is that they have less “slum” areas safer communities and less areas of “scary” communities making it less dangerous for policing. 3) Neighborhoods where there is a  concentration of lower income minority consentrated subpar housing need to be improved. Require owners of abandoned run down homes  be made to “remove or improve” these houses. If not done within a certain time they should revert to the city to “give” to the community to use for their own good once the city (and community) have determined  the best use of the property. This is where I stopped the comment as I realized it needed to be a diary on it’s own. Continuing this thread any properties turned over to the community could be used for new improved housing for community members new businesses by community members who pay lower lease rates to the community fund allowing for more future community development. Instead of a deteriorating community you have a upwardly developing community and a community that more community members develop a sense of belonging to and a pride and hope in making it better. And white owned small bussinesses should be persued and welcomed into the community also to help it become more diverse. 4) While many communities can use this concept for improvement some community menbers may determine that their neighborhood is not worth salvaging. Some neighborhoods have poor infrastructures are surrounded by industrial poluting industries and are unhealthy to live in. These are areas that may need to be repurposed and the community menbers should have the opportunity to move to housing in better environmental/infrastructure areas which may mean city state and federal assistance in buying the homes of and  relocating community members. But this must be done with the careful planning of not creating another low income “island trap” for the relocated communities. 5) As the economic circumstances of the POC improve many will want to move into better housing in more upscale neighborhoods. This should be encouraged by cities state and federal assistance that gives easier aplication and consideration to loans for POC. And close scrutiny should be given to realty company practices to insure equality in showing POC  all availabe homes in the area of their choice. Bringing POC into more diverse neighborhoods should be a priority of all cities. Now there is a warning that I feel that I should give POC wanting to move into “whiter” neighborhoods. Unfortunately there is a possibility that you may encounter more “karen” type incidents. Not everybody will welcome you to the neighborhood or recognize your right to be there. And police departments and cities should be aware that these incidents may be a part of any incident calls in neighborhoods that are becoming more diverse. It should become a part of all police department training but does not gaurantee safety in every situation. I have focused on housing options for POC because I haven’t seen much attention paid to this area in recent months. The main focus lately has been the increase of mass shootings and police shootings or violent actions against POC. We do need to keep the spotlight on these incidents but we need to be looking at longterm solutions also. Unfortunately longterm solutions take time and money. But they are an investment in a more secure future for all citizens not just the POC. I want to take just a little time to highlight the many bills before Congress directed at improving conditions for POC.  this is the best site I found listing the many bills being proposed at this time: pingree.house.gov/… Keep in mind that with the evenly divided Senate even when a bill passes the House it has a much harder time in the Senate. We can’t expect every bill to pass without some changes that weaken the bill. We will be lucky if we can get most of the important legislation to be voted on with the filabuster still intact. Write letters to your Congresspersons or call even your Republican Congresspersons. Let your voice be heard. One last reminder it is not too early to get your friends to register to vote for the 2022 and 2024 elections. And keep up on changes in voter laws in your state as many Republican legislators are trying to make it harder to vote. We can’t afford to lose ground in either the House or the Senate in midterm elections. GOTV2022 and 2024.
