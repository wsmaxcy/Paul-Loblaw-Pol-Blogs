L, Friday Night Beer Blog, esquimauxforDaily Kos For What Ales Ya, 2021-07-02, Hi beer fans! Come in and share a cold one with us! — In honor of the 4th enjoy Stan Freberg’s wonderful take on history  — I’m starting with a Hefeweizen from Sudwerk (Davis CA). Sudwerk is one of the O.G. NorCal brewers founded 1989 and for a long time they mostly stuck to German styles. Their beer list now shows IPAs and hard seltzer and fruity kettle sours too but their Munich-style hefeweizen still suits my taste. Lots of brewers have gotten into the hard seltzer trend and some are doing canned cocktails also. Some brewers doing that should have stuck to beer. 10 Barrel brewery (Bend OR) makes beer I like but whoever concocted their canned Bloody Mary should be doing something else for a living. I have drunk a good many Bloody Mary’s and I don’t remember ever pouring one out before this. Be warned. -- After the Hefeweizen I’ve got SN Hazy Little Thing. What are you drinking? Anyone brewing?
