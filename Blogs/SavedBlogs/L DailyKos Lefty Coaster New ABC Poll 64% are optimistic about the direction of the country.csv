L, New ABC Poll: '64% are optimistic about the direction of the country', Lefty Coaster, 2021-05-02, After President Biden’s first 100 days in office there is remarkable resurgence of optimism in the direction America is headed.  This is by far the most optimistic Americans have been in the direction of the country in the last 15 years.  Just before the November election only 42% of Americans were optimistic about the country’s direction.  ByKendall Karson Nearly two-thirds of Americans (64%) are optimistic about the direction of the country in the poll which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel.  Only a slim majority (52%) think the federal government should spend to revitalize the economy even if it raises taxes -- including 80% of Democrats and 54% of independents. The question of government spending and taxes largely divides Americans with 47% saying taxes should stay at the same level even at the expense of the economy -- including 78% of Republicans. After more than a year of the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the country roughly one-third of Americans (36%) still remain pessimistic about the country's future under Biden.  Republican leaders are viewed more adversely however. Two-thirds of Americans view GOP leaders in Congress as doing too little to compromise with Biden. Just over 1 in 5 Americans (22%) believe Republicans are doing about the right amount to compromise and only 10% think they are doing too much.
