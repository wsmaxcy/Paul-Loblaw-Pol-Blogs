L, WE NEED TWO AMERICAN PARTIES, SteveCickay, 2021-05-10, WE NEED TWO AMERICAN PARTIES In 1861 General Grant wrote this to his father as he decided where to place his allegiance: “There are but two parties now: traitors and patriots. And I want hereafter to be ranked with the latter and I trust the stronger party.” The Republican Party today is not the Party of Lincoln; it is the Party of Trump who continues to promote the Big Lie that he won the 2020 presidential election. This Big Lie led to the horrific January 6 2021 insurrection against the Capitol Building where Americans were injured and died and our democracy was almost shattered.   I agree with President Biden that we must unite this divided country and work in a bipartisan manner to address the critical problems this nation faces. Bitter partisanship will lead to continued strife obstruction and failure to  move our country forward. As a Democrat I sincerely want to reach across the aisle and find common American ground with respect to national state and local issues. I understand that heated partisanship is an impediment to our common progress but I also understand that in 2021 the Republican Party is still adhering to the Big Lie that is destroying the very foundation of our democracy. I admire Congresswoman Liz Cheney with whom I disagree strongly on almost every policy issue for her political courage in defending our democracy. But so many other Republican leaders and many Republican voters are either blindly following the Trumpian conspiracy theories or are cynically adhering to these known falsehoods for political gain. I am therefore led to question the integrity and patriotism of Republican candidates who in this toxic Republican environment continue to call themselves Republicans if they do not speak out like Congresswoman Cheney has against this anti-democratic Big Lie. I therefore urge Democratic voters to vote in the May 18th primary for only Democratic candidates running for such local positions as judges and school board directors where cross-filing is allowed because I feel those words of General Grant ring true today. Until the leaders and most members of the Republican Party denounce its Big Lie we must at all costs elect only Democrats to help preserve the very existence of our democracy.
