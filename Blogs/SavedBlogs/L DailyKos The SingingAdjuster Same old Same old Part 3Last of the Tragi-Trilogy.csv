L, Same old Same old Part 3Last of the Tragi-Trilogy, The SingingAdjuster, 2021-04-28, I promise this will be the last of these.  BUT….when Trump won by losing by 3000000 votes I got this sickening feeling which persisted for months.  Eventually I dealt as best I could but didn’t sleep well until Biden won and Georgia got two Democratic Senators.  That was four difficult years that only ended when Biden was sworn in.     But how could all these Americans vote for a man so pre-exposed as being a criminal liar cheater and gross individual?  Clearly this election WAS rigged. Putin and the Russian Bots had played our people like the proverbial fiddles.  And now we know more about what Mueller had found to prove this out. I got to work and put my rage into a song.  Again someone putting it in our faces even worse than Bush.  No morals no high ground just dirt and more Swamp.  The song had to identify the problems give them context and in the end had to imply ‘don’t give up hope’. I realized that this would prove to be a catalyst for us to get active as never before.  “We are the giant you woke us”.  Over the months and years Americans did get active as seen in the midterm elections when we took back the House.  God only knows what it would be like now if they didn’t.  I don’t know about you but my knowledge of the Russian vocabulary is quite limited.  The song’s closing words “This is the age of resistance” is the realization that even with Trump gone we still have a huge amount of work to do.  The bad people are entrenched.  They are only going to go out kicking and screaming and way worse.  This is an age.  It will take years.  We must endure.  We must prevail.  To quote Joe Biden “failure is not an option”. Enough politics.  I’m going to write about baseball or race cars or Butterflies. We Are The Giant — johncannonmusic.com/music Out in the street people bringing the heat Can’t stop it with a tweet That’s not freedom that’s not freedom  We are defiant get used to us We are the Giant you woke us  Empowering “tools” now they’re breaking all the rules And they’re playing us for fools That’s not freedom that’s not freedom  We are defiant get used to us We are the Giant you woke us  Misinformation manipulation False accusations That’s not freedom that’s not freedom No…. This is the age of resistance This is the age of resistance This is the age of resistance  We are defiant get used to us We are the Giant you woke us  There’s a crack in a bell where many brave souls fell We must drink deep from that well Of freedom that bell set the tone Of freedom you can feel it in your bones Of freedom rising up from the mud Of freedom yes it’s running through our blood Yeah… This is the age of resistance This is the age of resistance This is the age of resistance
