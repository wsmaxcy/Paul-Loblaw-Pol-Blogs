L, Rep. Plaskett: Where Was Liz Cheney Before Jan. 6?, NewsHound Ellen, 2021-05-15, House Impeachment Manager Stacey Plaskett (D-VI) has no patience for Rep. Liz Cheney’s sudden acknowledgment that Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy.  Plaskett an impeachment manager during Trump’s second impeachment for inciting the January 6th insurrection said the violence on that day “did not happen in a vacuum.” Yet Cheney was silent during the “smoke” before the Trump dumpster fire broke out at the Capitol. Liz Cheney and others did not say anything when the president was attacking regular Americans when he banned Muslims coming into this country caged children was part of the birther movement and said the most heinous things after Charlottesville.  Where was Liz Cheney and other members of the GOP who now are crying fire when there was smoke previously going on in the Capitol and throughout this country? In other words Republicans enabled Trump and Trumpism for years and now it’s just getting worse. For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
