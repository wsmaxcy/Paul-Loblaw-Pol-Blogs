L, Whitmer kidnap plot suspects face new charges: Weapons of mass destruction, Hank Z, 2021-04-29, A federal grand jury has added weapons of mass destruction charges against three suspects accused of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in an alleged plan that involved blowing up a bridge to slow down the cops. They were added Wednesday in what is known as a superseding — or new — indictment against the accused ringleader Adam Fox 40 of Wyoming and two of his alleged cohorts: Barry Croft Jr. 45 of Bear Delaware and Daniel Joseph Harris 23 of Lake Orion. The new charges come six months after undercover informants and federal agents helped foil an alleged plot to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home and leave her stranded in a boat in Lake Michigan. The undercover informants and agents had embedded themselves in the group which allegedly met and schemed in the basement of a vacuum shop in the Grand Rapids area and held training exercises at various locations across the state.
