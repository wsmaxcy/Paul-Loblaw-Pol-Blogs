L, Stephen Miller's Fascist Mouth Tries To Take On Joy Reid Jane Fonda, Frances Langum, 2021-06-10, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  No one will actually hire Stephen Miller for an actual job but Fox will toss him some bucks to sh*t on @JoyAnnReid and Jane Fonda.  Absurd.   The former Trump immigration Nazi told "propaganda hostess" Tammy Bruce that Jane Fonda is guilty of treason for her anti-war activities in VietNam.  You know Stephen that war was 50 years ago and since that time there have been other treasons committed inside that White House where you got your last W2 ever.   Then Miller made the case that because Joy Ann Reid has locks on her front door and car we must defend the border with Mexico.  Or something.   Hey Stephen did Joy Ann Reid ever use her car to separate migrants with clear legal refugee status from their parents?  Did she put babies in cages?  Your "logic" is absurd as is your desperation to be on television.   But Fox will kick you some dimes to spew white nationalism in their efforts to win back the Newsmax audience.  Congratulations.  Stephen Miller is still unemployed as the job market for architects of xenophobic child torturing is pretty dry right now. ‚Äî Bleeding Heart Liberal Marine (@BleedingMarine) June 10 2021 Stephen Miller Accuses Jane Fonda of treason ? lol. Stephen Miller isn‚Äôt fit to speak her name.   the creepy creep guy who gleefully cheered for separating children from their parents and locking them in barbaric cages at the border without medical care. ‚Äî ‚úåüèºrosanna arquette (@RoArquette) June 10 2021 And one more thing while I‚Äôm at it please know it was Stephen Miller aka #SatansSnotRag writer of all cruel policy and carnage speeches who convinced his boss that masks are a cultural wedge issue. Weaponizing masks in a pandemic has led to weaponizing vaccines. INSANITY. ‚Äî Barbara Malmet (@B52Malmet) June 6 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
