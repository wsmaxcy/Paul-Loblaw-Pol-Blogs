L, It's not morning in America any more., Milret2, 2021-05-04, I am just going to rant here for awhile. I do not have the ability to communicate as effectively as most others here and I am just an old man who has always been a liberal (even as a career military officer) and a Democrat since I first got to vote many many years ago.First it is my opinion that the Republican party is no longer the Republican party or any thing like the many men and a great many women who have supported it. I suspect that many who still support it have been shammed into supporting it and maybe the scales will drop from their eyes as more and more comes out about how badly this country has been damaged by the totally mendacious  crazy treasonous man (and I use that loaded word exactly as I meant it to be used … a person who works for and with a national state and I know that is only proper to use if your country is at war with the other country … those who think we are not at war with Putin fail to realize fully my fears) that would want to see America crippled by  the crazed reign of trump.Second I know that party is showing it’s true colors at this time by it’s actions. Now … that could be from craziness fear of the ballot box with it’s potential to vote out people who fail the racism that still is a part of America culture or ignorance or blindness to reality or fear of JUSTICE but it has reached the point where it is interfering with management of a plague has corrupted the DOJ severely  damaged many other important agencies and has fed lies to the American public … and now wants to eat it’s own who offer wise counsel to other “Republicans” at the Federal level.I hope and think it would be wise to possibly offer shelter to Republicans like Romney or Cheney as INDEPENDENTS. They have stood up and have shown significant courage. it may be that we will all have to stand up and use other ways besides politics but that is unlikely to be a success but just a greater and more painful end. Fascism have placed it roots deeply in other countries already. America NEEDS to stay independent and free. America has to make sure we win this fight with a virus that MUST be driven into control and that simply will not happen if we do not get enough people vaccinated and defeat the propaganda. The lies spread by that previous “president” will keep interfering with that and may worsen. Getting herd immunity where this virus is contained may not happen because of the last administration that could be fatal for our country. What do others think of my analysis? I think we have a very  big lift.
