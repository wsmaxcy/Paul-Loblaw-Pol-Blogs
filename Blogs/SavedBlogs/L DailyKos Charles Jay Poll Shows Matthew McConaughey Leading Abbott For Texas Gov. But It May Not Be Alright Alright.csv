L, Poll Shows Matthew McConaughey Leading Abbott For Texas Gov. But It May Not Be Alright Alright, Charles Jay, 2021-04-19,     We’ve had Governors Reagan Ventura and Schwarzenegger. And a new poll shows actor Matthew McConaughey may be a viable candidate against incumbent Greg Abbott in 2022.       The poll released Sunday by The Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas-at Tyler’s Center for Opinion Research shows the Texas-native who won an Oscar for “Dallas Buyers Club” with a double-digit lead over Abbott.        Forty-five percent of the respondents said that they would vote for McConaughey while 33 percent supported  the two-term incumbent. Another 22 percent said that at this early stage they would prefer someone else.        The survey was conducted from April 6-13 among 1126 registered Texas voters using a mixed-mode approach that included live phone interviews as well as online polling. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.       But there are big caveats . Any poll so far ahead of any actual campaigning — especially one with a well-known celebrity — is highly unreliable.        And a McConaughey candidacy would not necessarily be alright alright for anyone thinking of turning Texas blue especially when there are much more qualified and progressive potential Democratic candidates like Beto O’Rourke or Julian Castro.      McConaughey has described himself as “an aggressive centrist.” If he actually entered the race it’s not known whether he would run as a Democrat Republican or an independent. He has no known history of voting in any primary or donating to any political candidate.        In an interview last month with his hometown newspaper The Longview News McConaughey said:      "I’ve said this analogy a few time before but someone told me 'There ain’t nothing in the middle but dead armadillos and yellow lines.' I said 'Well I’m walking right down the yellow lines right in the middle of the highway right now. And the armadillos are free having a great time because right now both sides are so far to the right or the left there aren’t even tires on the pavement.'      “So I think going in to think Democrat or Republican or one of the other is small thinking now and even becoming unconstitutional because you’re supposed to serve the American people or the people of your state."        The Dallas Morning News poll indicated that McConaughey would face problems winning either the Democratic or Republican primary.      In a direct contest against Abbott the Democrats surveyed  went 66% to 8% for McConaughey and independents 44% to 28%. But  more than twice as many Democratic primary voters — 51% — said they wanted a progressive candidate for governor than wanted a centrist — 25%.      And among GOP voters only 20% preferred a more centrist candidate while 18 percent wanted someone like Donald Trump and 14 percent favored someone more conservative than Abbott.       And who knows what would happen if McConaughey ran as an independent. It might end up helping the Republican candidate whether it’s Abbott or someone else.      The only comparison might be the 2006 gubernatorial race when songwriter and humorist Kinky Friedman ran as an independent. At one point Friedman was polling better than the Democratic candidate Chris Bell but his support fizzled down the stretch and he ended up with only 12% of the vote.      In the end Republican Rick Perry won with 39% to Bell’s 30% with Friedman and  a Republican-leaning independent Carole Keeton Strayhorn combinging for 30% of the vote.      The Dallas News poll came out a month after McConaughey again flirted with the idea of running for governor of Texas saying he was giving the idea “honest consideration.”     He said on a podcast:     ““I’m looking into now again what is my leadership role? Because I do think I have some things to teach and share and what is my role? What’s my category in my next chapter of life that I’m going into?”        He repeated similar remarks on morning TV talk shows on which he also was promoting his memoir “Greenlights” and publicizing a virtual benefit concert he and his wife Camila were organizing through their Just Keep Living Foundation to help Texans impacted by the big freeze.      Colin Strother a Democratic consultant in San Antonio told the Dallas Morning News that McConaughey should forgo any candidacy and instead campaign for Democrats especially in red districts.     “I don’t think he can be successful as a candidate” Strother said “but he can be tremendously successful as an ally and partner” for state Democrats.     Jason Stanford who managed Democrat Bell’s 2006 gubernatorial campaign told the newspaper that reality will set in with Texas voters once McConaughey identifies as a Democrat or Republican or begins taking stances on issues.     “He’s fun but once you put him in a political context things will change” Stanford said.     And the reaction in the Twitterverse was not alright for a McConaughey candidacy.  Matthew McConaughey is thinking of running for Governor! Finally a rich middle aged white guy with no history of holding public office is going to save a state with deep and historic racial and social justice problems.
