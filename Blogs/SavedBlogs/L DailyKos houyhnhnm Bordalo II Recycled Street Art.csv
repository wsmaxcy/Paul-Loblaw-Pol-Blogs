L, Bordalo II Recycled Street Art, houyhnhnm, 2021-05-01, I saw this feature story on BBC World’s Travel Show this week and I thought it was a pretty cool subject for the Saturday morning Village diary. When I searched for an appropriate image to use with the story I discovered that it had been diaried by ZenTrainer five years ago. I can’t find that diary though and it seems like something that rates another look anyway. Artur Bordalo who goes by the name Bordalo II is a Lisbon artist famous for using street garbage to create animal sculptures and warn people about pollution and endangered species. The excessive production of “things” or the exaggerated consumerism which results in the constant production of “trash” and consequently in the destruction of our Planet are the main themes of his artistic production. That “trash” becomes the singular and peculiar raw material which he uses in the construction of small or large scale pieces which he has spread throughout the world and which aim is above all to be a universal manifesto. www.beyond-walls.org/...
