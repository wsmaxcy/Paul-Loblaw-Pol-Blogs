L, The Daily Bucket.  Morning Action at Dellinger's Pond., funningforrestforBackyard Science, 2021-04-20, APRIL 19 2021.  DELLINGER’S POND QUINCY CA. The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge. We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below. Each note is a record that we can refer to in the future as we try to understand the phenological patterns that are quietly unwinding around us. To have the Daily Bucket in your Activity Stream visit Backyard Science’s profile page and click on Follow.           Just when I think there won’t be much more worth waiting around for I am graced with other wildlife doing something I have never before observed at the pond.  Now It’s Your Turn What have you noted happening in your area or travels?   As usual post your observations as well as their general location in the comments. Thank you.
