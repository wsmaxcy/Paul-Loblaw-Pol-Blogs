L, The Madness of Queen Greene: Dr. Fauci's a virology genius and an evil international criminal, HalBrown, 2021-05-11, Click to enlarge illustration Warning: More alliterations below. I was going to write about this RAWSTORY article and even had my illustration: Then I read “The far right’s conspiracy theory blaming Fauci for COVID-19 worms its way into mainstream” on Daily Kos and realized I had nothing new to say except to write about the Madness of Queen Greene. Her Royal Wretchedness has been demonstrating how off the rails she is ever since her election to The House of Representatives.  The fact that she can appear with the Sergeant of Sleaze Matt Gaetz to a cheering crowd at a Florida rally suggests that they may have a big future going on the road as the ultimate odd couple of politics. That is as long as Donald Trump doesn’t realize that he doesn’t want them as cheerleaders because they are too toxic for his brand and decides to piss on their parade It is clear that this conspiracy or call it a fever dream didn’t come from the mind of Marjorie Taylor Greene. This would be giving her far too much credit for creativity. If she was actually this clever she’d have a career in stand-up comedy. She could write for InfoWars where a recent post is “Tucker Carlson Calls For Investigation Into Fauci Wuhan Lab Connection.” Excerpt because I know you probably won’t click the link:  “Tony Fauci is punishing the country — you us everyone. The question is: why is he doing that?” Carlson asked suggesting “Maybe he liked it that’s possible. But you’ve got to think that at least part of Fauci’s authoritarian germ hysterical is a cover for something else. Could it be that Tony Fauci is trying to divert attention from himself and his own role in the COVID-19 pandemic?” The host then pointed to an article by science writer Nicholas Wade that outlines how Fauci approved dangerous research at the Wuhan facility that many believe led directly to the coronavirus outbreak. “Tony Fauci had authorized payment for the research. For five years — from 2014 to 2019 — the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases which Fauci runs and has for decades pumped money to a group called the EcoHealth Alliance” Carlson continued. The Poll: The question I am asking myself is whether or not Marjorie Taylor Greene is a political one trick pony and if so that her act will soon wear thin. Considering the appetite for conspiracy theories among an unfortunately large minority of the population and having to begrudgingly admit she has a certain je ne sais quoi about her and lamentably she may still be a crowd-pleaser a year from now. What do you think?
