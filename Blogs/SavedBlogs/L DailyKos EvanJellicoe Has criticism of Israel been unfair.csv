L, Has criticism of Israel been unfair?, EvanJellicoe, 2021-05-11, I realize that “I’m just raising a question” has fallen into disrepute of late because of the many conservatives who have been using that line disingenuously. But the approach is still a legitimate part of a sincere discussion if it’s intended to raise actual questions and the questioner is genuinely interested in the answers as I am. So let’s talk about Israel.  Israel has been receiving a lot of criticism in recent years (well actually for a lot of years). It seems to me that the criticism has long been rather one-sided focusing mostly on the bad that is being done by Israel with insufficient consideration of the bad that has been done to Israel. So allow me to phrase my questions in the form of positive “talking points” (or “debate points” if you prefer). In doing so I am not stating positions that I will die to defend; I am merely asking “How do you respond to these points if they are presented in good faith?” I am fully aware (unlike say Tucker Carlson) that “raising a question” is not at all the same thing as actually proving something. There may be perfectly good responses to those questions. I also acknowledge that these are old points but I raise them here as fresh points because it seems from my perspective that they are being gradually forgotten and I just want to haul them out again blow the dust off and review things just to see where Kossacks stand on these points today.  So anyway here goes: 1) Given the 2000-year history of anti-Jewish sentiment beginning with their expulsion from their ancestral homeland by the Romans and culminating in the gas chambers of Nazi Germany it seems entirely right and proper for the Jews to finally regain a place that they can call “home.” But the Arab nations in the Middle East were staunchly opposed to the Jews coming to that territory and attempted on multiple occasions to destroy the Jewish state. Only with reluctance have Israel’s Arab neighbors come to accept Israel’s right to exist and even today not all of them are on board. 2) Some supporters of Israel maintain that Jordan—officially created as “Transjordan” only two years before Israel’s creation and dropping the “Trans-” in 1949—should be considered the “Palestinian State.” As early as the 1920s the rulers of the region that became Jordan had instituted policies discouraging Jews from immigrating into the country. Why could not we have encouraged non-Jewish Palestinians to settle in Jordan while allowing the Jews to have their own state? 3) The “occupied” West Bank was originally part of the new nation of Israel but it was captured by the Arab nations during the 1948 war. Had the Arabs not taken the West Bank by military conquest there might not be a “Palestinian problem” today. 4) Since 1948 Israel’s struggle has been merely for the right to exist. Four major wars were fought between 1948 and 1973 and in each war a victorious Israel gained only the ability to go on existing. Had any of those wars been lost there would be no Israel today. Given that level of threat to its very survival Israel’s actions to ensure that survival may have gone beyond what civilized people consider acceptable but their actions should at least be understandable and should be understood and criticized in the context of everything that happened. 4b) Many of Israel’s most-criticized actions have been in direct response to Arab hostile actions. Criticism of those hostile actions often seems to be less intense than the criticism of the Israeli response as though a double standard is in effect.  What think ye?  Postscript: A double standard if real could reflect either a pro-Arab or an anti-Arab mindset. I have long suspected that at least a few people think that Arabs are not quite civilized so “mindless terrorism” is simply what they do but we expect better than that from Israelis. I do not have any sympathy for that point of view.  Update: There are some interesting comments down below. As a teacher I always tried to follow the wisdom “There is no such thing as a dumb question.” (Although in the classroom I did add one exception that being the question that just got asked and answered but somebody wasn’t paying attention and asked it again. But I digress.) Anyway my questions above are asked in good faith. Some of the challenges below caused me to go back and Google some things and that added to my understanding. Yeah I know I could have just made this whole diary a private research project from the start but I meant for it to be a Kos open discussion. One frequent problem I see with Progressives is that when certain questions get asked the questioner gets blasted as a bad person for even asking the question on the assumption that any person who would ask such a question must have bad motives. This type of response does not gain converts or even better-informed people. It merely hardens the lines of separation. I will return later with some actual responses to some of the comments.
