L, Who knew? Previous Guy follows the path of Zeppo or Gummo, annieliformoranbetterDemocrats, 2021-04-18, Lauren Boebert (R-CO) has learned from the death of Bernie Madoff about Ponzi schemes because QAnon surely couldn’t be a cult of personality or a grift used by criminals in charge. Because the previous guy still says “the best is yet to come” having killed hundreds of thousands we also know he couldn’t be smart enough to be a fellow traveler in at least one form of Marxism. Instead he used the bankruptcy laws bribes and defamation counter-suits to avoid Ponzi prosecution for schemes like Trump University. Then there’s the Big Lie that keeps on giving. Alright y’all....A ponzi scheme promises success for everyone but defrauds everyone involved. The only ones who come out on top are the criminals in charge. That is Marxism. https://t.co/UsrYZAMhyN      https://t.co/FNNPEKOCMN  Donald Trump's eleventh-hour pardons in virtually his last act as president included the man behind a $300 million Ponzi scheme whom one of his 1400 victims once described in court documents as a "scumbag."  Also on the list: a former Google executive convicted of stealing trade secrets a real estate developer charged in the "Varsity Blues" college admissions scandal and a Las Vegas gambler imprisoned for his role in an insider-trading scandal. In all Trump pardoned 73 people and commuted the sentences of 70 others including his former political strategist Steve Bannon. Rumors had circulated that the "Tiger King" documentary star Joe Exotic would be pardoned. He wasn't. But among those receiving presidential mercy were people convicted of various financial and other white-collar crimes including three found guilty of defrauding investors in real estate deals. www.cbsnews.com/... @laurenboebert is also certain the “Italian” Marx Brother is named Ponzi. pic.twitter.com/W24d7RULpQ  The comparison of Ponzi to Marx is unfair. Charles Ponzi's capitalist if fraudulent schemes have nothing in common with Marxism  and Ponzi-ism has surely did less damage to humanity than Marxism. But Ponzi was a colorful con man. I recommend the wikipedia entry. https://t.co/khResjMR02 pic.twitter.com/LedZvjoVEK    This tweet from @charliekirk11 that incorrectly claims that @KamalaHarris is a Marxist is an excellent example of a common Twitter phenomenon: conservatives using the words "Marxist" "communist" and "socialist" as a rhetorical cudgel regardless of accuracy.cc: @ZellaQuixote pic.twitter.com/p3y8C5Q7mf
