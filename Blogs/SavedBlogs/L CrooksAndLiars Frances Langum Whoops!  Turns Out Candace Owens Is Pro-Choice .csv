[Above from 2019 Traitor Trump probably got his "Hitler did some good things" from Candace Owens going on Lou Dobbs because that's where Traitor Trump got everything in his dull head.] Candace Owens is pro-choice go figure.   In a tweet about the Covid-19 vaccine Owens insisted that no one in her family would go near the shot and it was her body her choice yadda yadda.  Multiple replies pointed out that pro-choice about medical decisions is just fine with Democrats.   Um Candace....This is what Democrats have been saying for years it's called "pro-choice". pic.twitter.com/EpnA1gRL8k â€” Amy LynnðŸ§¦ (@AmyAThatcher) July 8 2021 I did not have Candace Owens going pro-choice on my Deplorables bingo card. â€” DuckingPeachy (Nora) (@DuckingPeachy) July 8 2021 MAGA lunatic fraudster Candace Owens says people should be able to choose whether or not to take the Covid vaccine but she also believes women whoâ€™re raped should be forced to give birth if they become pregnant.The Hitler apologist is pro-choice when it suits her propaganda. â€” Ricky Davila (@TheRickyDavila) July 8 2021 First of all I do not - not even for one second - believe Candance that she and her family are not vaccinated. She is just like Tucker Carlson is and everybody at Fox and OANN are.Second Candace Owens comes out as pro-choice guys!!! pic.twitter.com/Kualfte7XR â€” Molotovsky ðŸ¥€ (@GriffTheImpaler) July 8 2021 Thank you for finally agreeing with the pro-choice movement. I'm sorry that you are risking death for it. 100% of the Covid-19 patients at my husband's hospital are unvaccinated â€” ðŸŒŠðŸ˜·Pfizer poweredðŸ˜·ðŸŒŠ (@dopey4grumpy) July 8 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
