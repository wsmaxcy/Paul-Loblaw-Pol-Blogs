C, Things Are Not Just Bad in Philadelphia They Are Getting Worse, Dana Pico, 2020-12-07, According to the Philadelphia Police Department there have been 463 homicides as of 11:59 PM EST on Sunday December 6 2020. That’s 1.358 per day. With 25 days remaining in the year if the average holds the city can expect another 40 bodies in the streets by the end of the year. 463 + 40 = 503. The all time record is 505 homicides set in 1990. 1989 stands in second place with 489 and now the City of Brotherly Love has just exceeded 1988’s previous third place finish of 460. But there’s more. I noted on October 22nd just a month and a half ago: The Current Crime Statistics released by the Philadelphia Police Department note that as of 11:59 PM EDT on October 21st 391 souls had been sent to their eternal rewards. That isn’t the record of course but 2007 is the base year on the Current Crime Statistics website and that was the number of people killed that year in Philly. This year has now matched that total . . . with 71 days left in the year. The math is simple: 391 people killed in 295 days so far equals 1.325 people killed every single day. With 71 days left in the year at that rate the city should see another 94 people sent to their deaths before the ball drops in New York City. 391 + 94 = 485. That would not be a new record; 1990 holds that dubious honor with 505 killings and 1989 comes in second with 489 but 485 would be solidly in third place! Think about that: in just 46 days Philly has crept up so that the projected homicide totals have increased by eighteen dead bodies; in just 46 days 72 corpses have littered the city’s streets . . . and that’s a rate of 1.565 per day. As the weather has turned cooler a time when homicides are expected to decrease the killing rate has increased in foul fetid fuming foggy filthy Philadelphia.  On October 22nd I noted that Philly was headed for a solid third place finish. As recently as August 18th the projected numbers were for ‘just’ 439 homicides.  Now it’ll take just a few ‘extra’ murders and Philadelphia could break the all time record. Go team go! You can do it Philly you can do it! I have previously noted that George Soros’ supported District Attorney Larry Krasner has done what he wanted to do. But Mayor Jim Kenney and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw deserve a lot of credit too. The hapless Commissioner Outlaw has at least criticized Mr Krasner’s soft-on-crime prosecutions but coming from Oakland California and later Portland Oregon she too is infused with at least some of the left coast attitude toward crime; if she hadn’t been Mayor Kenney would never have appointed her in the first place. This is the problem with liberalism! This is the problem with the boneheadedly stupid Social Justice Warriors! In their attempts to Do Good that are making things worse because their ideas are so wrongheaded so out of touch with reality.  Crime exists because people tolerate its existence and the left the oh-so-understanding-and-tolerant left always willing to show sympathy to those less fortunate are more tolerant of crime than normal people. That is the culture which allowed a city like Portland to tolerate the Mostly Peaceful Protests™ of last summer and which excuses crime because well just because the criminals have had life so tough. Rudy Giuliani showed the way. He didn’t tolerate crime and when he was mayor of New York City he had the police arrest for and the district attorneys prosecute the small petty crimes that people like Larry Krasner excuse and ignore and forgive. Mr Giuliani showed the punks what the inside of the penitentiary was like before they became more hardened criminals a lesson lost on Mr Krasner.
