C, The Democrats’ Weird January 6 Obsession, John Hinderaker, 2021-07-02, Democrats are determined to keep the memory of the mostly-peaceful demonstration in Washington last January 6 alive. It isn’t just a matter of investigatory commissions either. The obsession has spilled over into family holiday celebrations. Former senator Claire McCaskill came out of retirement to share this bizarre sentiment on MSNBC: Former Sen. Claire McCaskill:  "We’re going to start a new family tradition in my family: on the Fourth of July and every Fourth of July going forward we’re going to watch that video the New York Times put together of January 6.” pic.twitter.com/P8YZ9oTuzC — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 2 2021  
I guess we can all add not belonging to McCaskill’s family as something we can be grateful for. These people are nuts. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
