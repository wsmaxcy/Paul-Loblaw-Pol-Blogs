C, A 9-Year-Old Tells It Like It Is, John Hinderaker, 2021-06-22, Where I live the number one issue is exploding violent crime. The number two issue is Critical Race Theory in the schools which the overwhelming majority hate. I posted here a video that has gone viral of a 15-year-old boy addressing my own local school board on the evils of CRT which is deeply embedded in the public schools. Now here is another one: a nine-year-old girl in a suburb just South of mine calling her school board to account for reneging on its promise to ban political posters including BLM posters from the schools:  It is this kind of grass roots activism that will drive the scourge of racism from our public schools. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
