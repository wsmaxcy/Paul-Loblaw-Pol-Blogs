L, Lessons From the 2020 Election, Liberal ThinkingforAll Daily Kos Progressives, 2021-06-27, Right now Democrats are struggling to push any meaningful legislation through Congress in the face of threatened Senate filibusters. It is common to blame Sen. Joe Manchin (and a few other Democratic Senators) for blocking progress but the root causes of this stalemate go back to the 2020 campaign. The Democratic Party failed to propose a compelling future for the country. This was the result of nominating Joe Biden a known centrist as the presidential nominee and his strategy for being elected. The Biden campaign ran on getting rid of Donald Trump and fixing the covid pandemic a very limited message that didn’t help down-ballot Democrats get elected. Dumping Trump and fixing covid were noble and essential goals but they were never going to translate into large Democratic victories in Congress. We can trace the 50-50 Senate (and we should thank our lucky stars we even got that) to this lack of compelling Democratic vision and we can trace our weak control of the House to that same cause. I mentioned this lack of compelling message both during the campaign and more recently. The typical response is that I’m just wrong because Biden and the party ran on a very progressive platform. But this isn’t borne out by the facts. During the campaign and more recently I looked at the actual messaging from the Biden campaign specifically what the public was seeing as represented by Web search engines. For example here are the top ten topics the Biden campaign ran on during the general campaign for President: In summary he says that Trump is a bad person and that he will use the powers of the presidency to better handle covid. He says he’s considering a black woman for a running mate. None of these are topics which a congressional candidate could pick up and run on. An example of that would be “Biden backs Medicare for All”. Another example would be “Biden says a minimum wage of $15/hour is essential for workers”. These would provide the foundation for candidates to go get seats in Congress. Voters could see the concrete benefit for them voting for Democratic congressional and presidential candidates. The ten topics above represent the top Google search results between 7 April (when Sen. Bernie Sanders left the race) and 3 November (election day) 2020 for the phrase “Biden says”. (The Google search term for this is: “Biden says” before:2020-11-03 after:2020-04-06.) This is what the public was actually hearing from the campaign. [One topic that Biden would shut down the economy if scientists recommended it appeared twice in the top ten results so I’ve added the eleventh result as number 10 on the list above. The topics listed are in the order returned by Google meaning the first one is the one Google’s algorithm thinks is most likely you want to see.] Lest you think that I’m cherry picking topics from Google I also ran searches for the months of May through October 2020 and selected the top three for each month. All of the top results by month show more of Biden either attacking Trump or making claims he could handle the pandemic better or both and a few miscellaneous other items that wouldn’t help down-ballot Democrats. The lone exception is one article about how a Biden proposal to spend $700 billion would create American jobs. He also says he would be President for all Americans whether they voted for him or not which is really a reiteration of his plan to work with Republicans (in Congress meaning the Senate). To make sure this isn’t an artifact of using a Google search I compared results for the campaign period with the results of the same search on DuckDuckGo. There’s no material difference. DuckDuckGo turned up a slightly different list but that list included such things as: This list has more items where Biden is defending himself against various charges (like the Hunter Biden laptop story and his claim “stupid bastards” was made in jest). It has his Gettysburg speech call for unity (which is an excellent thing in a campaign but not actionable by down-ballot candidates). Perhaps candidates could have picked up on his call for unity his comment that we haven’t yet lived up to the American ideal (of treating everyone with dignity and respect let’s say) and his comment that George Floyd’s killing had a worldwide impact to call for police reforms and a more united country united across race and ethnic barriers. But that would have been them making campaign material on their own not a unified message from the party that they could run on. What we see here across the entire campaign is a strategy that has no unifying theme that any other candidate could run on. It notably lacks anything that puts the Republicans at a disadvantage. Look the Republican Party is the party of death and destruction. They are the party of exploiting the people. Surely there’s something we could run on that’s better than that. As for being “President for all Americans” this is another problem with the Biden campaign. He ran on working with Republicans. This was a misguided appeal for Republicans (the very people who hate him and want to keep him out of office) to vote for him. This set up the dynamic we see today. Now Biden has to contend with Sen. Joe Manchin who is promoting bipartisanship in the Senate. Biden’s campaign provided the exact talking point Manchin needed to launch his stubborn resistance to Democratic legislation passing Congress. Manchin says he will only support bills that have Republican support. How is this supposed to work in practical or political terms? In practical terms the Republican Party is not a legitimate political party. They don’t have the good of the country at heart. To the degree you “work with” them and have them provide any input to bills those bills will—by definition—be bad for the country. The worst thing for the country is to work with Republicans and let them be part of any resulting legislation. Their whole raison d’être is for people to look out for themselves. You can’t expect help from Republicans just “You’re on your own sucker!" Working with them is a recipe for weakening the country and allowing the very rich to extract more wealth and power from the politically weak. And in political terms getting Republican votes in the Senate means watering down legislation so much it is meaningless or not passing anything at all. Which brings us to today. Republicans refuse to spend another dime on new government programs. They refuse to raise taxes even though the Republican tax cuts over the last few decades have all proved to be unmitigated disasters. While not helping the U.S. economy in any way (see Recession Great) they have steadily moved money from the working class and the poor to gated communities where it is trapped outside the working part of the economy. A sensible response would be to get rid of all those tax cuts. But do you have a single Republican vote to do so? Sensible people think not. Why don’t Democrats operate the way Republicans do? Let’s take stock. It’s shocking when you compare Democrats to Republicans. Democrats are deficient in every category. Okay “deficient” may be too strong because you can see from this list we don’t want to be exactly like them. But look couldn’t we just be strong? What would it be like if Democrats fought political battles the way Republicans do? I’m not suggesting we raise armed militant groups or launch violent insurrections to put the threat of physical violence behind our positions but could we actually have some aggression from Democrats? For example Democrats have worked with Republicans on immigration reform. No! Don’t do that! Instead take the INS to court and demand they stop deporting minors brought here by their parents. Those minors were not breaking the law and deporting them is unconstitutional. Doing so penalizes them for the sins of their parents a clear case of attainder which is outlawed by the Constitution. Yes this is a novel theory. Yes opponents will vigorously oppose it. Yes the SCOTUS full of right-wing zealots is likely to rule against it. I don’t care. In taking this case to the Court we are making the case to the public that it is unfair to treat these minors as if they were criminals. If we do that we can take DACA off the table. We don’t have to negotiate it as part of immigration reform. This puts us in a stronger bargaining position on immigration reform to get the parts we want. This is an example how Democrats should think about and strategize political opposition to the Republicans. You take an offensive position. Defensive strategy is losing strategy. You can’t win every battle. To even stay even you must go on the offensive at some point. For example Democrats want abortions to be legal but rare. No! Don’t do that! Instead pass laws in New York California and Illinois that define “life” (rights as a person) to begin at birth. That’s an aggressive position. Now when you have a SCOTUS case on when “life” begins you argue that it doesn’t begin with a fetal heart beat it begins with sentience which happens at or near the moment of birth. You talk about how much the other side wants the rights of the mother to be compromised because people have religious beliefs about pregnancy that don’t stand up to scrutiny. Now you have an offensive position. You make them fight for every inch of position they want to take. Right now we are compromising on the terms of not allowing abortion at all. But if we are aggressive about setting rights at birth then any compromise will come from a position of strength. How much of her rights are they trying to take away? How do they justify that assault on her rights? Let’s just say I’m not criticizing the Biden Administration. I think of them as a far better alternative to a second Trump term. Each day we have revelations how Trump tried to create a dictatorship. If he’d been re-elected we’d have a full-on white supremacist dictator stomping out civil and human rights here and around the world. So was focusing almost solely on the downfall of Trump a good strategy for Biden? We will never know but I don’t think so. In the first place anyone running a competent campaign could have defeated Trump in 2020. He was destined to lose the moment SARS-CoV-2 entered the U.S. and probably from the moment it escaped into the human population (regardless of source). Republicans are incapable of handling this kind of threat. They don’t want government to act effectively and they don’t believe in science. But the only way to handle a worldwide pandemic is with strong effective government action based on science. Republicans think science is a rival political theory intended to defeat them. They are constitutionally incapable of embracing science or basing any decisions on it. Trump as the epitome of a Republican politician was never going to be able to handle covid and his failure was going to defeat him regardless of who ran as the Democratic nominee. Literally I could have defeated Trump having no political presence because he was history as soon as covid made history. (I would have flattened him too because Trump doesn’t know things. I know things.) So we could have run either Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren and won the White House either way IMHO. But because they were issues-based politicians it would have meant much wider wins in the House and Senate. That means they likely would have had working majorities in both houses making it much easier to pass legislation. It would have had a knock-on effect of improving Democratic presence in the states which would have had the follow-on effect of making it easier to redistrict without as much disadvantage and would have made it much easier to defeat Republican voter suppression and election stealing bills. Should we have done that? We didn’t even need to do that. All we needed was for Joe Biden to run on one (or more) progressive issues. That would have been sufficient for down-ballot Democrats to pick up that issue and run for their own seats. It is important to win elections. But it is vastly more important to convince the American people you are the political party best looking out for their interests because then they vote for you and you win elections. Right now we should be looking for the next progressive candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. We need to avoid the big mistake of 2020 our failure to nominate someone who would aggressively promote the Democratic (i.e. progressive) vision of the future. Who is going to run against the Republicans? We had someone Joe Biden who ran against a single Republican example but not someone who ran against the Republican Party. In fact he wanted to work with them. We should never run someone who wants to work with Republicans until the Republican Party is fully reformed. The proper strategy is to make your deals with the American people and then tell Republicans in office what they can do to support what the American people want. So in 2024 who is going to promote an attractive progressive future? Who is going to run on single-payer healthcare? Who is going to run on a full assault on climate change? Who is going to run on forcing the police to follow the law? Who is going to protect our communities from corruption and abuse? Who is going to get rid of the war on drug addicts and start protecting the health of the public? Who is going to redress the systemic injustices of the past like red-lining racist policing and voter suppression? Who is going to get rid of hidden money in politics? Who is going to reduce the size of the military and set up proper regional alliances so that we don’t bear the cost of the world’s security all on our own? Who is going to revise taxes to eliminate the wealth and income disparity? Who is going to raise minimum incomes and get more jobs for Americans? If you are following this you might be Kamala Harris VP and you might be thinking “That could have been me.” Indeed. If we’d run Harris in 2020 she might have run on at least one progressive issue. How would that have played out? Suppose she had run on Medicare for All. There’s a very clear message there: We would be much stronger dealing with this covid pandemic if we had a full-on public healthcare system. People would not hesitate to go get testing. The system itself would have developed and distributed testing making it difficult or impossible for that old guy to interfere with its development and deployment. That alone would have saved thousands of lives. Millions of people who lost their jobs would not have lost healthcare coverage to their great relief. Instead of being hit twice once by the disease and then again by the financial consequences they would only need to deal with the getting better. We would have had much better statistics to work from. This is a crushing message against the Republican DIY healthcare proposal. And of course it would be even stronger to run on Healthcare for All because it is an even stronger proposal against Republicans. So in 2024 it is entirely possible for Harris to be a progressive candidate. It only depends on what she runs on and what she wants to get done. What about challengers? I find it hard to think of good progressive challengers at the presidential level. We have good progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House but it is very difficult to go from the lower house to the White House. A more likely path is from governor which suggests Gov. Gavin Newsom (CA) as an example. But is Newsom actually a progressive? He could possibly position himself that way. Another contender would be Gov. Jay Inslee (WA). I like Inslee and I supported him in his run for governor. While a centrist in many ways Inslee has a long history of supporting action on climate change and he opposed George W. Bush in the war in Iraq. While I would have liked either Sen. Warren or Sen. Sanders to have been elected in 2020 I don’t think they should run again in 2024. They did their part for democracy. They are great Senators and I want them to continue to be Senators. The other presidential candidates from 2020 were not very progressive so it is hard to see how they run a progressive challenge campaign in 2024 especially if Harris runs with a progressive message. I’m open to seeing them prove they have it in them. But I need proof. What we see now is a hard slog for Biden to get any further legislation through Congress. This is partly because Congress is so politically divided. I think that goes back to a strategy too narrowly focused on defeating Donald Trump. In 2024 the Democratic Party needs to nominate a progressive to lead the ticket. They must have at least one major progressive issue under them and the entire party should pick up that issue and run with it. This would be a good time to run on actually fixing the healthcare system so that we don’t have another plague year like 2020. It would be a good time to run on a full fix to climate change. Or pick your topic. But have one candidate. If you want to win both the White House and the Capitol.
