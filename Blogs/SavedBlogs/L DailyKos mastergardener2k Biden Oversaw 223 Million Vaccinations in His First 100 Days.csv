L, Biden Oversaw 223 Million Vaccinations in His First 100 Days, mastergardener2k, 2021-05-01, Donald Trump kept saying “we have turned the corner” on Covid so many times one would think we were in an endless maze. Joe Biden saw it differently. His administration is conducting one of the greatest vaccination campaigns in history starting with bringing the vaccination level up now to 44% of all Americans receiving at least one dose. About 55.8% of adult Americans have received at least one injection. The percentage of senior Americans who received at least one jab is now at 82.6%.  Vaccinations in the US are continuing at 2.55 million per day on average. Now it is time to help the rest of the world as supplies of vaccine are more than meeting demands in the US. abcnews.go.com/… Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeated Friday that starting next week Canada will be receiving 2 million doses a week from Pfizer alone. Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada in recent months. Every adult in Quebec will be eligible to make a vaccine appointment on May 14 and in Ontario Canada’s largest province every adult can book an appointment starting May 24. Trade-dependent Canada previously lagged on vaccinating its population of 38 million because it lacks the facilities to manufacture the vaccine itself.  khn.org/… Mexico’s health ministry said it is receiving 2 million doses from Pfizer this week. It has received more than a million doses from Belgium since Wednesday and expects around another million this week. Reuters could not confirm if all the remaining Pfizer doses would come from Michigan.
