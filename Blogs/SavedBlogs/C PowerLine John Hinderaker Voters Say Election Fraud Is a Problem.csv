C, Voters Say: Election Fraud Is a Problem, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-15, America’s CEOs may believe that election integrity is unimportant but voters across the political spectrum disagree. Rasmussen finds that 51% of voters believe that voter fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election: A majority (51%) of voters believe it is likely that cheating affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election including 35% who say it’s Very Likely cheating affected the election. Seventy-four percent (74%) of Republicans believe it is likely last year’s presidential election was affected by cheating a view shared by 30% of Democrats and 51% of voters not affiliated with either major party. The question asked was: “How likely is it that cheating affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election?” Voters want election integrity and don’t buy the Democrats’ claim that it is somehow too hard to vote: Asked which is more important making it easier for everybody to vote or making sure there is no cheating in elections 60% of Likely Voters say it’s more important to prevent cheating while 37% said it’s more important to make it easier to vote. Only 22% of voters say it is currently too hard to vote while 34% said it’s too easy to vote and 41% say the level of difficulty in voting is about right. Majorities of all racial groups – 59% of whites 56% of Blacks and 63% of other minority voters – say it is more important to make sure there is no cheating in elections than to make it easier to vote. Likewise majorities of all racial groups – 64% of whites 59% of Blacks and 58% of other minority voters – reject the claim that voter ID laws discriminate against some voters. Here in Minnesota my organization found that 69% of registered voters want voter ID laws. America’s left-wing CEOs are badly out of step with mainstream Americans. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
