C, The Swamp's Warped Dictionary, Seton Motley, 2021-03-09, For a society to function and continue to exist – the same words have to mean the same things to everyone.  You can’t say “X” – and have a portion of a population take it to mean “Not X.” The Left – and the DC Deep State Swamp – have a very warped and perverted dictionary.  Where all sorts of words and phrases mean the exact opposite of what they actually mean. How The Left’s War on Words Manipulates Your Mind: “Words can now literally be defined with their antonym. We are a hair’s width and an ounce of stupidity away from ‘war is peace freedom is slavery.’” As referenced the godfather of grasping this totalitarian insanity – was George Orwell. The Corruption of Thoughts Language and Power: George Orwell’s View on Government-Controlled Language We the Antonyms are now WELL down this horrible rabbit hole. Liberal Doublespeak: Words That Don’t Mean What They Say What Liberals Say vs What They Mean The Seven Dumbest Things Democrats Demand You Believe Gaslighting Biden White House Calls COVID Bill with Zero GOP Support ‘Bipartisan Democrats’ Meaning of ‘Equity and Inclusion’ Is ‘Believe What We Say or Else’ Of course the Left and the DC Deep State Swamp do all this to get what they want.  When what they want is antithetical to what We the People want – and to the best interests of our country. To wit: Here is Britannica’s definition of “free trade”: “A policy by which a government does not discriminate against imports or interfere with exports by applying tariffs (to imports) or subsidies (to exports). A free-trade policy does not necessarily imply however that a country abandons all control and taxation of imports and exports.” All of which is the exact opposite of DC’s definition of “free trade.” DC and their Big Business cronies want to keep their First World executive compensation packages and stock market returns – while Third World-outsourcing their manufacturing and production. Which means closing millions of American businesses – and opening them elsewhere.  To be able to fire tens of millions of Americans – to instead hire cheaper Third World labor. For decades the world’s nations have made this screwing of the US ever more lucrative for Big Business.  By subsidizing the products Big Business relocates to make there and sell here.  And by limiting and tariffing what remaining US businesses make here and seek to export there. This has been the international status quo – for decades.  This is the exact opposite of “free trade.”  But it is precisely what the DC Deep State Swamp has been calling “free trade” – for decades. Donald Trump long saw this lie for what it was.  And addressed the heck out of it during his presidential term – by adhering nearly perfectly to the dictionary definition of “free trade.” Trump highlighted the very many limits and tariffs emplaced upon our stuff – and the very many subsidies pumped into their stuff. And emplaced strategic – and very tiny – tariffs to force these anti-free trade nations to behave better.  And it worked like a charm. Trump’s Measly ‘Trade War’ 2019: $21 Billion in Tariffs – and a $22 Trillion Economy Ten Reasons Trump Economy Is Best in Fifty Years Joe Biden Admits Trump’s USMCA Is ‘Better than NAFTA’ U.S. Farmers Get a Much-Needed Break under Trade Pact with Japan Lower Wage Americans LOVE Fair Trade and Rigid Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Americans Have Seen Their Best Wage Growth in Forty Years Manufacturers Added Six Times More Jobs Under Trump Than Under Obama’s Last Two Years Trump’s dictionary-definition free trade – was orders-of-magnitude better for America and Americans.  Which meant the DC Swamp and their Big Business cronies HATED it.  And again cracked open their Bizarro dictionary to mis-define it. Trump Trade Policy Gets Failing Grades Trump’s Trade War Is Bad and Everyone Is Losing Trump’s Trade War Is Bad for US Economy Trump’s China Trade War Risks Damaging US Economy Trump Signed the Worst Trade Deal Ever (USMCA) Trump’s Withdrawal from TPP Trade Deal is Hurting U.S. Exports to Japan And the DC Swamp and their Big Business cronies started working to reverse Trump Trade and restore DC’s fake trade – even before Trump….lost office. DC Globalists Are Already Trying to Reverse Trump’s Massively Successful Trade Policies And since Joe Biden…won office – the DC Swamp and their Big Business cronies have ramped up their efforts to restore the DC Swamp anti-free trade anti-America “free trade” status quo.  Which DC-careerist Status Quo Joe is more than happy to do. Biden Must Not Repeat Trump’s Trade Policy Mistakes Biden Must Reverse Trump’s Protectionism Joe Biden Can Reverse Trump’s Warpath with China Biden Starts Unwinding Trump’s Trade War Biden’s Trade Chief Tasked with Reset after Trump Tariff Chaos All of which is outstanding news.  If by “outstanding” – you mean terrible.
