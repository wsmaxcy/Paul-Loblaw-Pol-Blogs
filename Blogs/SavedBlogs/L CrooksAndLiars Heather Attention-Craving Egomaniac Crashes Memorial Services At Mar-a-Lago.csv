L, Attention-Craving Egomaniac Crashes Memorial Services At Mar-a-Lago, Heather, 2021-06-12, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  This has to be one of the most pathetic things I've read all week. Trump is apparently so starved for attention that he's crashing people's memorial services at Mar-a-Lago: Tossed from the White House banished from Facebook and Twitter Trump has never seemed more distant from public consciousness. But while  he can’t broadcast out those same platforms offer a surprisingly  intimate glimpse into his new life thanks to the prolific posting of  the club’s guests. At every moment of his day Trump is bathed in  adulation. When he enters the dining room people stand and applaud. When he returns from golf he’s met with squeals and selfie requests.  When he leaves Mar-a-Lago he often encounters flag-waving throngs  organized by Willy Guardiola a former professional harmonica player and  anti-abortion activist who runs weekly pro-Trump rallies in Palm Beach.  “Give me four hours and I can pull together 500 people” Guardiola  says. Trump recently invited the self-proclaimed “biggest Trump  supporter in the country” for a private consultation at his club.                    In this gilded Biosphere Trump encounters no one who isn’t  vocally gratified by his presence. When he speaks extemporaneously so  many guests post footage that you can watch the same weird scene unfold  from multiple vantage points like the Japanese film Rashomon. Trump seems so comfortable the journalist and Instagram sleuth Ashley Feinberg has noted that he’s taken to wearing the same outfit for days on end. Blue slacks white golf shirt and red MAGA cap  are to the former president what the black Mao suit is to his old  frenemy Kim Jong Un. Club members say his new lifestyle agrees with him.  “Presidents when they finish always look so much older” says Thomas Peterffy the billionaire founder of Interactive Brokers LLC who lives  three doors down from Mar-a-Lago. “Not true for Trump.” He’ll show up to anything. In recent weeks Trump has popped into engagement parties  and memorial services. A Mar-a-Lago member who recently attended a club  gathering for a deceased friend was surprised when Trump sauntered in to deliver remarks and then hung around apparently enjoying himself.  This insular feedback loop amplified by the worshipful validation he gets for doing Newsmax or OAN TV hits doesn’t appear likely to diminish  as he settles into his New Jersey golf club for the summer and prepares  to resume his trademark rallies. “Donald Trump needs the adulation of  the crowd the way you or I need oxygen to breathe” says Michael Cohen  his estranged former lawyer. By all accounts Trump’s life after the  White House doesn’t resemble that of a typical ex-president so much as a  foreign monarch cast into exile—like Napoleon at Elba but with golf  and a bigger buffet. You'd think the list of Republicans running down there to kiss his ring that the article also runs through would be enough to satisfy him but that doesn't seem to be the case if he's crashing memorial services and engagement parties.
