L, Trump Organization criminal charges coming because its lawyers are "outraged", annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-06-28, It begins...more likely prosecution of Trump corporate tax fraud coming first because it'll always be about strong cases. Trump Organization facing possible criminal charges sources say https://t.co/yfzrKV0jGu   Ron Fischetti said that "the corporate office will plead not guilty and we will make an immediate motion to dismiss the case against the corporation." Also potentially facing charges is the company's longtime CFO Allen Weisselberg The Times reported. [...] NBC News confirmed this week that investigators had also been probing Matthew Calamari the former Trump bodyguard who's now the company's chief operating officer. The Wall Street Journal which first reported on the focus on Calamari cited people close to the matter who said Calamari was being investigated over whether he received tax-free fringe benefits from the company. Vance has been investigating a variety of allegations of financial improprieties against Trump's company. Court documents show that Vance is probing "possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization" which could include falsifying business records insurance fraud and tax fraud. www.nbcnews.com/...  “Gaslighting is when you bullshit with other ridiculous rhetoric to take attention away from what's really happening like the Trump Organization being criminally charged for Tax Fraud and what will be revealed as money laundering.”  Folks leaks always come from the defense and allied parties never prosecutors. Donald's lawyers are openly talking so this is more creating his own reality nonsense. https://t.co/t1VGdGBT67  She thinks that this from 8/20 when we didn’t know what the Manhattan DA was investigating is somehow inconsistent with me saying today (as I have been lately) that it would be super-hard to get Trump on tax fraud for undeclared payments to underlings. https://t.co/LCEfoVJ7eD  For some reason news that Trump Organization lawyers tried to talk authorities into not charging the company with tax fraud reminded me of Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II https://t.co/TlsThtz8wP    Defeated ex-President closed tonight by saying we are “one people” but at least he didn’t say it in German.  EXCLUSIVE: We sent @waltermasterson to yesterday's Trump Rally in Ohio. MAGAs told him they left in the middle of the speech because they were bored and disappointed. pic.twitter.com/pTPsEZWeGs  To be sure Barr’s rectitude that day doesn’t excuse his earlier kowtowing to Trump or his politicization of the Justice Department. And what Barr had done to precipitate his confrontation with Trump — issuing a bombshell public statement that the Justice Department had found no significant electoral fraud — didn’t exactly arise from high-minded motive: Karl reports that then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had prevailed upon Barr to make the announcement fearing that Trump’s campaign to overturn the presidential election would cost their party the Senate. www.washingtonpost.com/... Barr helped boost Trump's election fraud narrative *before* the election.McConnell asked the Attorney General to help him win 2 senate races.Watch my #minirant tonight:pic.twitter.com/x6mfI7DoSK   🚨NEW: Supreme Court will release decisions tomorrow morning at 10am.

Agolf Twitler says his eventual and impending criminal judgment will be devastating for New York.Hey New York start preparations for celebrations.

If he flips he has to tell all not just the free tuition stuff.   Trump lawyer says Manhattan prosecutors told him they will not bring charges against Trump himself when the first indictment comes down. “They just said ‘When this indictment comes down he won’t be charged. Our investigation is ongoing.’” @woodruffbets https://t.co/CmKPFlmd9Q
