L, So Tucker Carlson is Scared that new information about him is about to come out., kashani, 2021-06-29, Tucker Carlson claims that the NSA is spying on him. He seems particularly concerned about his emails being revealed.   Of course anything coming out of TC’s mouth is to be taken with a generous pinch of salt. He does seem genuinely concerned though as if directing his audience to cast their disdain on the NSA and ignore anything TC may or may not have done. It is possible that he is just trying to stretch his lame story that the NSA were behind the January 6 insurrection.  Either way the guy seems to be unraveling and it’s about time.
