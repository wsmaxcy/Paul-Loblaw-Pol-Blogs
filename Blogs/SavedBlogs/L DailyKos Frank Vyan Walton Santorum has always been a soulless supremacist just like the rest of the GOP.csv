L, Santorum has always been a soulless supremacist just like the rest of the GOP, Frank Vyan Walton, 2021-04-27, So I have a hypothesis about Santorum and the Right-wing Christian Evangelicals he represents.  His recent screed where he proudly declared that America was “built on Judeo-Christian values” is exactly the distorted sense of entitlement and supremacy that has been driving the Republican party ever since the Racist Southern Dixiecrats left the Democratic Party in the late 40’s and eventually became Republicans. Let’s not mince words what he was spouting was core underlying ideology — of the Klan. They believe that they are morally superior that they are religiously superior and that they have the “God given right” to treat other “lesser” people in what ever manner they choose.  They truly do believe that this land was “empty” when they “found” it.  That they  and they alone — “tamed the west” and built this nation from literally nothing with their own bare hands. CNN's Rick Santorum: "We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean there was nothing here. I mean yes we have Native Americans but candidly there isn't much Native American culture in American culture" pic.twitter.com/EMxOEYDbg7 This is the core tenent of White/Christian/Western Cultural Entitlement.  The problem isn’t that Santorum openly expressed this view it’s the fact that this is the common shared view or nearly all modern day Republicans. Through his words we can truly discovery what is at the center of the black pitted Republican heart. Clearly Santorum didn’t learn these views in school or college.  In college they would have taught him about how the coalition of American states was built upon the previous example of the coalition of the Iroquois Confederation as noted by Aldous J. Pennyfarthing. PBS.org: The Iroquois Confederacy founded by the Great Peacemaker in 11421 is the oldest living participatory democracy on earth2. In 1988 the U.S. Senate paid tribute with a resolution3 that said "The confederation of the original 13 colonies into one republic was inﬂuenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the constitution itself. Let’s recall that the European Nations which he gives the most credit for the formation of our nation were all Monarchies.  England.  France Germany. None were Democracies.  We got that from the Native Americans. Aldous also points out that the Ten Commandments aren’t really reflected in the Constitution particularly since the first four Commandments demand the worship of One God and dissuade the worship of all other idols. For instance look at the Ten Commandments. The first four—don’t worship other gods don’t make graven images don’t use the Lord’s name in vain and keep the Sabbath—have basically zero to do with our system of government and are straight-up antithetical to “religious freedom.” If you can only worship Yahweh that kind of paints you into a corner. And Jesus Jumprope-Skipping Christ using the Lord’s name in vain is protected free speech you dunce. You can thank our First Amendment for that.  Again the First Amendment supports worship of choice.  It grants freedom of religion but also freedom from religion and blocks the ability of Congress from doing exactly what the first four Commandments request.  He ignores the irony that when Christians fled Europe after being religiously persecuted they did not establish American where that persecution could be recreated only with their version of Christianity “on top.”  That would be recreating the Religious Supremacy they had just escaped from. Santorum of course ignores the contributions and even the very existence of the Native American Nations — he ignores that perhaps the reason they have been mostly culturally stamped out was that after the genocide that was exactly the goal and agenda implemented by the U.S. Government using “Native American Boarding Schools' which sought for decades to “squeeze the Indian out of them.”  From the 1880s to the 1930s the policy of the United States government towards Native Americans was assimilation into white society. Native languages spiritual beliefs foods traditions and family life were considered “uncivilized” so missionaries and the government opened schools on and off reservations to force children to abandon their traditions. Army officer Richard Pratt founder of the first federal Indian boarding school Carlisle Indian Industrial School gave a speech in 1892 in which he summarized this philosophy as “kill the Indian…save the man.” In Wisconsin the U.S. government ran three boarding schools three day schools and contracted out three additional boarding schools to religious and other organizations. Most Native American children who went to the boarding schools were forcefully taken from their families. Subjects such as reading writing math and history were all taught from the white point of view and boys were taught to farm while girls were taught domestic work. Children were forced to cut their hair dress in uniforms and speak English. These schools emphasized conversion to Christianity and “citizenship training” in the foundations of U.S. society. Today we see this assault on Native cultural identity as cultural genocide. A culture cannot survive without its children to carry on its traditions. 50 years later when Kevin Costner was making the movie “Dances with Wolves” he found that the Oglala Sioux actors he had hired didn’t know the language of their own ancestors. He grew so frustrated he fired the lot of them but eventually rehired the group after they finally buckled-down on their lessons.  That’s cultural genocide. But then Santorum also ignores the contribution of the Chinese in building the Transcontinental Railway he ignores the contributions of African slaves in building the American bread basket.  No single ethnicity built this nation alone it was a combination of efforts. He ignores anything that is outside his myopic neo-Christian White focus. He always has. This is why the GOP generally opposes African-American studies Native-American studies Asian-American studies and Latinx-American studies — they all of this as being methods to “create grievance” against white people.  Perhaps that’s because in the history of this nation there are plenty of points for grievance to be built.  instead we have GOPers saying “We should teach the good things about Slavery.” That’s like saying the Civil War had a net positive effect. Everything “good” that came of the antebellum and Jim Crow era happened despite Slavery not because of it. And it’s not like this is the worst thing he’s ever said.  Not Hardly. He claimed that Muslims were responsible for the type of Anti-Semitism we saw at the Tree of Life massacre despite there being literally no evidence of this. Santorum’s response to the wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers across the country and the vandalization of dozens of Jewish tombstones in February 2017 was to accuse Muslims of anti-Semitism even though there was no evidence that Muslims were responsible for those incidents. “If you look at the fact of the people who are responsible for a lot of this anti-Semitism that we’re seeing a lot of it is coming from the pro-Palestinian or Muslim community” he told CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. As a point of fact the local Muslim community raised funds and support of the Tree of Life Synagogue after their tragedy. You see this vandalism and violence was likely implemented by neo-Christians so of course Santorum had to point the finger elsewhere. He went after the Parkland shooting kids arguing that they should stop trying to change gun policy stop “blaming others” by trying to prevent such shootings they should get in there and do something with there own hands — like learn “CPR” to they can try to clean up the mess after the next inevitable shooting. “How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that — where there is a violent shooter and actually respond to that” said Santorum who raked in $115942 from the National Rifle Association (NRA) during his 16 years in Congress according to Politico. Or telling Van Jones after he expressed concern for his own son’s safety in the hands of police that his son was in “greater danger in the neighborhoods.”  “The reality is that your son has unfortunately a better chance of being shot by someone in a neighborhood in a criminal event than he does by a police officer. And it’s not even close” he told Jones. So you’re assuming that Van Jones’ son is a criminal?  That he associates with criminals?  That he lives in a neighborhood rife with crime?  That it’s not possible for a young black man to be smart articulate clean and live in middle-class or even upper-class home? I used to live in the kind of “neighborhood” that Santorum is talking about and I can testify that in those areas the police were seriously more of a threat than anyone else.  But further I’ve lived in neighborhoods nearby — as I type this I’m barely more than a mile from Compton — and I can tell you the different can be wider than night and day.  This neighborhood is quiet calm and safe.  We’ve had more police shootings here in Gardena than we’ve had violent shootings and murders. This reminds me sadly of the death of Bill Cosby’s son.  He wasn’t “in the neighborhoods” — he was killed while changing his tire on the 405 freeway by members from a Ukranian Gang who were looking to rob him. On January 16 1997 disgraced comedian and TV star Bill Cosby’s 27-year-old son Ennis Cosby is murdered after he stops to fix a flat tire along California’s Interstate 405 in Los Angeles. The 405 which runs some 70 miles from Irvine to San Fernando is known as one of the planet’s busiest and most congested roadways. Construction began on Interstate 405 in the late 1950s with the first section opening in the early 1960s. At approximately 1 a.m. on January 16 1997 Ennis Cosby a graduate student in special education at Columbia University Teachers College who was on vacation in Los Angeles was driving a Mercedes-Benz convertible on Interstate 405 when he pulled off to Skirball Center Drive to change a flat tire. A Ukrainian-born teenager Mikhail Markhasev and two friends were at a nearby park-and-ride lot using the phone. Markhasev reportedly high on drugs approached Cosby to rob him but when Cosby took too long to hand over money he was shot and killed. Ennis Cosby was the third of Bill Cosby’s five children and said to be the inspiration for the character of Theo Huxtable on the hit TV sitcom “The Cosby Show” which originally aired from 1984 to 1992. I know that neighborhood well as I often used the 405 and Sepulveda Ave. which follows it to reach High School and to enter the San Fernando Valley.  There are million dollar homes in those hills it’s just south of Encino where many movie stars live it’s just north of Benedict Canyon where Kobe Bryant and Eddie Murphy used to live.  Is that the “neighborhood” Santorum was thinking of? Back on Nov 5th Santorum also argued that a significant amount of violence was coming “from Democrats” not Trump supporters. "They boarded up businesses in New York City not to keep Donald Trump supporters from looting OK?" Santorum a Republican former Pennsylvania senator said during a CNN panel Wednesday. The CNN commentator Van Jones replied saying the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden "is not stoking" that behavior and said he thought Trump was egging on his supporters." Where is the real threat here?" Santorum responded. "I don't see any Republicans I don't see any people storming around burning buildings and crashing through storefronts." Yeah well in January that changed now didn’t it? in all these cases the myopia lack of facts and understanding is bank vault thick.  Being in his own neo-Religious neo-Supremacist anti-fact anti-Science bubble for his entire life Santorum has no reason not to believe exactly the stereotypical nonsense that he believes. This is naked blatant White/Christian Supremacy. And still as bad as he is he’s still not as bad as Gym Jordan Lauren Boebert and Marjorie TayloGreen.  These people believe that Biden is trying to steel people’s beef for climate change. There was a point in time when both Corey Lewandoski and Kayleigh McEnany had active contracts with CNN.  Now both of them are fair too extreme and far too nutty. Santorum used to be on the extreme right of the spectrum but those days are over.  He’s now very much at the center of the Republican mainstream.  I think there’s some value in understanding this perspective.  I think it’s fine to call for him to be ousted from CNN but the simple fact is that he hasn't been on the network for the past six months. Perhaps even longer because they usually bring him in for Elections coverage. From my perspective it’s a moot point.  Suspending him for awhile is essentially redundant he’s already essentially suspended. One of the problems that CNN has is that they are just as much walled off within a bubble as Fox News is.  I watch CNN almost constantly and can tell you they have a horrible habit of basically repeating and re-arguing the same points and stories all day long.  Each host basically trods the same ground.  It doesn't matter if it’s Erin Burnett Alyson Camerota Kate Bolduan or Don Lemon.  Chris Cuomo is the lone exception as he will sometimes bring on hard right guests to debate with although it often proves fruitless and pointless because they can’t make coherent cogent arguments. Except for him It’s the same voices making the same arguments over and over and then over again.  Like the sound of one hand clapping. People like Santorum break that up. He brings a different perspective and he can be very exasperating to the regular hosts and guest but he gives as good as he gets.  He’s used to being the underdog in the argument — as he should be — and he keeps coming without getting bent out of shape by the discussion.  His views and arguments may be abhorrent and frankly racist but then most of the arguments of the Republican party are virulently racist by definition so that’s a given in any attempted discussion with them.  He provides a window into that side of the GOP ideology.  He lets us see just how fucked up they are in so many ways and does it without being argumentative or blatantly dismissive. He’s polite most of the time.  I mean he’s a fucking asshole but he’s a polite asshole.  The arguments he brings up are bullshit but it’s important that they be shown to be bullshit by being challenged debunked and dismantled in real time.  Most of the ideas he brings up wouldn’t even be imagined by the other hosts.  CNN frankly doesn’t act enough as a debunking machine that they should.  This crap needs to be called out and it needs to by systematically destroyed piece by piece. Inch by Inch. Besides compared to him the rest of the GOP are a pack of raving screaming rioting lunatics. They won’t even come on CNN and if you look at examples like Rudy Giuliani’s appearances on Cuomo it would be nothing more than a crazed shit show.   There’s no rational or reasonable conversation to be had with them.  None. Santorum is still valuable because he can fill that function.  He can absolutely be infuriating but without people like him who do they talk to? John Kasich?  Here are his statements as observed by Sam Seder:
