C, Shapes of things, Scott Johnson, 2021-01-09, With the Democratic takeover of the executive and legislative branches a few days away Big Tech has swung into action in a big way to suppress conservative speech. The treatment of President Trump is of course the leading indicator. Here is a compilation of the developing stories as of this morning:  • Ebony Bowden New York Post: “Trump permanently suspended from Twitter account” • Salvador Rodriguez CNBC: “Trump tweets from POTUS handle account says looking ‘at the possibilities of building out our own platform’” Key points: President Donald Trump continued tweeting Friday evening using the government-owned @POTUS account despite having his @realDonaldTrump account permanently suspended by Twitter earlier in the day. The tweets were removed from the service almost immediately. It’s unclear what steps Twitter took in the handling of the @POTUS account. • Kelly Tyko USA Today: “President Trump blocked from posting to Facebook Instagram ‘indefinitely’ at least through end of term” • Ahiza Garcia-Hodges MSN: “Google Play suspends Parler until app develops moderation policies” • Elizabeth Culliford & Stephen Nellis Reuters: “Google suspends Parler social networking app from Play Store; Apple gives 24-hour warning” • Rachel Sharp Daily Mail: “Steve Bannon’s podcast is REMOVED from YouTube hours after Rudy Giuliani’s appearance where he blamed deadly MAGA riot at Congress on the DEMOCRATS for ‘censoring and suppressing’ Trump supporters” • Andrew Mark Miller Washington Examiner: “Conservative #WalkAway Facebook page removed along with hundreds of thousands of videos and followers” 🚨🚨🚨FACEBOOK has removed the #WalkAway Campaign and has BANNED ME and EVERY MEMBER of my team!!! Over half a million people in #WalkAway with hundreds of thousands of testimonial videos and stories is GONE. Facebook has banned everything related to #WalkAway. pic.twitter.com/WxoKu1HpSb — Brandon Straka (@BrandonStraka) January 8 2021   • Nick Arama RedState: “The Purge Is Here: Twitter Banning Influencers on Right Removing Followers” • Andrea Widburg American Thinker “The tech monopolies have swung into action” • Tucker Carlson FOX News: “From Twitter to CNN the left is coming for your speech” • Caroline Glick “Trump rings in the era of ‘total political correctness'” • Brendan O’Neill Spiked: “The woke purge” And a blast from the past for mood music:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
