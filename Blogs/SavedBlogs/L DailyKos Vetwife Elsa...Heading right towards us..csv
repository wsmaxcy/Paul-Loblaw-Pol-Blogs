L, Elsa...Heading right towards us., Vetwife, 2021-07-06, Well we knew this year would be a bad storm year.   I am not on any pity party but honestly between the Pandemic the death of our daughter/granddaughter the stress of the custody battle going on in Ga with our great granddaughter the overwhelming heat and now this Tropical Storm which is predicted now to be upgraded to Cat I hurricane and Tornadoes I have to say it is a bit much.   I don’t think DeSantis will handle this as well as previous governors.  We’ll see.  At first they thought that it would be Tampa that would be impacted but now the  power crews are heading to Leesburg Ocala Crystal River and a little more north. If you folks don’t hear from some of us in the Ocala Crystal River and Tampa area know we are weathering storm surges high winds tornadoes and  lousy weather conditions with extreme heat. We do have a generator and we have never tried it out.  It will power a window unit and refrigerator and we are good but we need to resupply up on drinking water and I think we have enough gas.  We have started putting thing up or laying them down on the lanai.  We left for Irma and we won’t do that again.  We may get lucky and it won’t be too bad and supposed to be gone by Thursday here in this area but who knows?   Oddly enough the thing I am concerned about is the ground is SOOOOOOO saturated the trees concern me. Well wish us well and keep us in your thoughts.    Here is the latest.  The conditions in southern Florida have begun to deteriorate as Tropical Storm Elsa took aim at the Florida Keys early Tuesday prompting a hurricane watch for portions of the west coast of state according to the National Hurricane Center. In addition to damaging winds and heavy rains the Miami-based center said the peninsula was in danger of life-threatening storm surges flooding and isolated tornadoes. A hurricane watch was issued for the west-central and Big Bend coast of Florida from Egmont Key to the Steinhatchee River.

Here is the latest advisory for #Elsa from the National Hurricane Center. pic.twitter.com/LFDHF0asPL Scott yelled Wolf a lot Desantis seems like he just doesn’t care one way or the other but this much has been accomplished.    Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday expanded an existing state of emergency to cover a dozen counties that span an area of Florida where Elsa is expected to make a swift passage on Wednesday and President Joe Biden approved an Emergency Declaration for the state ahead of the storm.
