L, Overnight News Digest: How Extremists Use Irony to Spread Hate, maggiejeanforOvernight News Digest, 2021-04-26, Stories covered in tonight’s post: Here's How The 1st 2020 Census Results Changed Electoral College House Seats U.S. to probe Louisville Kentucky police after Breonna Taylor death  This is an open thread where everyone is welcome especially night owls and early birds. NPR On a recent episode of his livestreamed show the 22-year-old extremist Nick Fuentes repeated a formula that has won him a following with some of the youngest members of the far right. He went on an extended violent and misogynistic rant only to turn to the camera and add with a smirk "Just joking!" In this case from the April 22 edition of Fuentes' show America First a viewer wrote in to ask Fuentes for advice on how to "punish" his wife for "getting out of line." Fuentes responded "Why don't you smack her across the face?" The rant continued for minutes. "Why don't you give her a vicious and forceful backhanded slap with your knuckles right across her face — disrespectfully — and make it hurt?" Fuentes went on. At one point he pantomimed punching a woman in the face. He then added "No I'm kidding of course. Just kidding. Just a joke." Fuentes was following a playbook popular among domestic extremists: using irony and claims of "just joking" to spread their message while deflecting criticism. The Guardian The nation’s top PFAS manufacturers executed a lobbying and campaign donation blitz in recent years as the federal government attempted to regulate the toxic compounds. A Guardian analysis of campaign finance records found spending on PFAS issues jumped as lawmakers introduced over 100 new pieces of legislation in 2019 and 2020 and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed strong new restrictions. Observers say the results are clear: industry’s congressional allies defeated nearly all PFAS legislation while the Trump EPA killed watered down or slowalked new rules that never went into effect. Spending is expected to remain high this legislative cycle as the Biden EPA has already advanced industry-opposed restrictions and Democrats have promised to re-introduce failed legislation and billions in revenue are at stake. Chemours one top PFAS manufacturer in fiscal year 2020 reported about $5bn in earnings of which fluorinated chemicals represented about $2.2bn. The Guardian During an unusual Oscars ceremony on-the-road drama Nomadland triumphed with a win for best picture best actress and a historic victory for Chloé Zhao becoming the first woman of colour to be named best director and only the second woman ever.

C/NET The first craft to fly on another world hit a jogging pace for the first time on Sunday its fastest speed yet. In its third flight on Mars NASA's tiny helicopter dubbed Ingenuity flew about the length of a football field and hit a top speed of around 4.5 miles per hour (2 meters per second) which is roughly the average pace at which humans jog.   "Today's flight was what we planned for and yet it was nothing short  of amazing" said Dave Lavery the NASA program executive for Ingenuity in a statement.

Anshu Priya could not get a hospital bed in Delhi or its suburb of Noida for her father-in-law and as his condition continued to deteriorate. She spent most of Sunday looking for an oxygen cylinder but her search was futile. So she finally turned to the black market. She paid a hefty amount - 50000 rupees ($670; £480) - to procure a cylinder that normally costs 6000 rupees. With her mother-in-law also struggling to breathe Anshu knew she may not be able to find or afford another cylinder on the black market. This is a familiar story not just in Delhi but also in Noida Lucknow Allahabad Indore and so many other cities where families are desperately cobbling together makeshift arrangements at home.

Al Jazeera Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to another year in an Iranian jail a development that prompted an instant backlash from the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson. An Iranian Revolutionary Court sentenced the 43-year-old British Iranian woman on Monday to a one-year jail term after finding her guilty of propaganda activities against the Iranian government her lawyer said. She has already served a five-year prison sentence in Iran having spent four years in a jail in the capital Tehran before being released into house arrest in March 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic. “Nazanin Zaghari was sentenced to one year in prison and a one-year ban from leaving the country on charges of propaganda against the Islamic Republic” her lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the Emtedad news website. Al Jazeera At least 22 people have been sentenced to death by military courts in eastern Libya since 2018 in what Amnesty International described as “shame torture-tainted” trials aimed at stifling dissent in the war-torn country. The international rights watchdog on Monday said military courts “convicted hundreds of civilians in eastern Libya in secret and grossly unfair military trials”. The trials were “aimed at punishing real or perceived opponents and critics” of forces loyal to eastern-based renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar. Those convicted include journalists peaceful protesters and individuals who criticised Haftar’s forces on social media. Oil-rich Libya has been torn by conflict since the toppling and killing of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising a decade ago. DW News Germany will be doing away with vaccine prioritization by age group by June Chancellor Angela Merkel said after discussing the vaccination drive with the heads of Germany's 16 states on Monday. "This does not mean that everyone can then be vaccinated immediately" Merkel said. "But then everyone can apply for a vaccination appointment and they will then be given one according to the supply" the chancellor added. Merkel also cautioned that Germany could expect a difficult social debate if only part of the population is vaccinated as those who get the jabs could ultimately crave more freedoms.  "We will enter a transition phase that will not be easy" she warned. "We have to deal with this question very sensitively." Moves to relax measures for vaccine recipients The chancellor said the German government was looking at relaxing curbs for people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. DW News Germany's Green Party is more popular than German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc according to a new opinion poll published on Sunday. The Greens polled at 28% up 6 percentage points according to the Kantar research group's Sunday trend poll carried out on behalf of tabloid Bild am Sonntag. The newspaper reported that this was the Green's highest-ever poll rating in the history of the Sunday trend polls. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) fell two percentage points to 27%. The Social Democrats (SPD) who share power in a coalition government with the conservatives also lost two points slipping to 13%. This was their lowest result since August 2019. NPR Texas has gained two more votes in Congress and the Electoral College for the next decade while Colorado Florida Montana North Carolina and Oregon each gained one seat based on the first set of results from the 2020 census released Monday. The seven states losing one vote each are California Illinois Michigan New York Ohio Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The U.S. Census Bureau's acting director Ron Jarmin reported the new state population counts at a virtual news conference. The long-awaited announcement has reset the balance of power for the next decade in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College where each state's share of votes is tied to its census numbers. The scramble for the last of the 435 seats for voting members in the House was remarkably close. "If New York had had 89 more people they would have received one more seat" said Kristin Koslap during the press conference. Koslap senior technical expert on 2020 census congressional apportionment in the Census Bureau's Population Division said instead that last seat went to Minnesota. The results had been held up for months due to delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration's interference last year. Under current federal law these state population numbers were due by the end of 2020. But the bureau had been warning since April 2020 that census results would be delivered later than originally planned. A bipartisan group of lawmakers recently renewed a push in Congress to extend legal reporting deadlines formally for the 2020 count. NPR The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Monday it is preparing to restore California's right to set its own vehicle emissions standards in a widely anticipated reversal of Trump-era policies. The decision which will take several months to be finalized reaffirms the Golden State's powerful position as an environmental regulator after the Trump administration had in 2019 sought to remove California's powers to set its own emissions standards. It also sets the stage for negotiations over how strict federal vehicle standards will be under President Biden. "I am a firm believer in California's long-standing statutory authority to lead" EPA administration Michael Regan said in a statement. Reuters The U.S. Justice Department on Monday launched a civil probe of the Louisville Kentucky police department whose officers last year fatally shot Breonna Taylor an unarmed Black woman in a botched raid sparking street protests against police violence. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the probe which will focus on the police department and the Louisville-Jefferson County government will evaluate whether the police routinely use unreasonable force including on protesters as well as if they routinely conduct unconstitutional searches. The move came five days after the department began a similar review of the Minneapolis Police Department after its former officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd a Black man last year. Reuters British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday denied a newspaper report that he had said he would rather bodies piled “high in their thousands” than order a third COVID-19 lockdown. Johnson is facing a stream of allegations in newspapers - all of them denied - about everything from his muddled initial handling of the COVID-19 crisis to questions over who financed the redecoration of his official apartment.  read more  The Daily Mail newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying that in October shortly after agreeing to a second lockdown Johnson told a meeting in Downing Street: "No more fucking lockdowns - let the bodies pile high in their thousands."

Washington Post If you haven’t already you’ll see a surprising message pop up on your iPhone from Facebook in the next few weeks: Do you give it permission to track you? To make your iPhone more private tap “Ask App not to Track.” Do not tap “Allow” unless you love creepy online ads. To prevent this same pop-up from appearing for lots of different apps — and to limit some of the other digital tracking in your life — you also should change two settings right now. I have instructions below. What’s going on? With a software update that arrived this week called iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 Apple is finally forcing apps to come clean about a kind of surveillance they’ve been conducting on us for the past decade. Behind the scenes apps can probe your phone for personal information that helps them target you with ads or even sell data about you to others. Now marketers and data brokers can’t access a valuable way to identify your phone unless you explicitly say it’s okay. New York Times WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will undergo an internal review to root out white supremacy and extremism in its ranks as part of a larger effort to combat extremist ideology in the federal government officials said on Monday. The task of identifying extremists throughout the United States and specifically in government agencies has come to the top of President Biden’s agenda since Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. Many of the rioters were found to be members of extremist groups. “We recognize that domestic violent extremism and the ideology the extremist ideologies that spew it are prevalent” said Alejandro N. Mayorkas the homeland security secretary. “We have a responsibility given what we do to ensure that that pernicious influence does not exist in our department.” CNBC: Biden's 100-day stock market performance is better than any of his predecessors going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower https://t.co/VDrsSlkcV5  The crew of the Overnight News Digest consists of founder Magnifico regular editors side pocket maggiejean Chitown Kev eeff Magnifico annetteboardman Rise above the swamp Besame and jck.
