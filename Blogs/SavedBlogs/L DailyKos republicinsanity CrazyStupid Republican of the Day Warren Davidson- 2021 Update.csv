L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Warren Davidson- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-07-06, On this date in both 2018 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” had its first profile of the sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio’s 8th District Warren Davidson who was first elected to office in June of 2016 shortly after former Speaker of the House John Boehner said “F*** this s***” and peaced out of of Congress. As part of the GOP gerrymandering of House districts after the 2010 elections Boehner made sure that his own home district was galvanized to protect him from being booted by any Democratic challenger making it the reddest district in all of Ohio. So when he retired no less than fifteen…. Yes FIFTEEN Republicans battled it out like it was the goddamned Hunger Games to take his place in Ohio’s 6th for the remainder of his term which Davidson then coasted to victory in the general special election to establish himself as the incumbent. A short time later the vote was practically just done over again for the November election this time with a SIXTEENTH Republican in the primary and again breezed to victory against a Democrat because of the +17 Republican lean for the district in the Cook Partisan Voting Index.Almost immediately after arriving in Washington D.C. Davidson issued what could be interpreted as a final “F*** you” to Boehner as he left office immediately joining the Republican House Freedom Caucus that constantly was trying to bring about his downfall and ultimately made Boehner resign in frustration to go work for the medical marijuana lobby.  Now our fair readers might be wondering… how the heck did a guy who’s only been in office for just about two years earn himself a place in CSGOPOTD?Well that’s easy enough to answer. Warren Davidson seems to REALLY hate poor people.This series of posts never hesitates to thank Republicans who served in our armed forces for that service. However we still reserve the right to call out those veterans for bulls*** unrelated to it when necessary. And while we’ll salute Warren Davidson for his time as a U.S. Army Ranger without hesitation we still think it’s truly f***ed up that he went to a gathering of veterans to gripe about “moochers” who were within the V.A. Medical system and kick them out of it. For someone well off like Davidson maybe having your medical care paid for by the Department of Veteran’s Affairs isn’t a choice he has to make… but for every blue-collar veteran with injuries endured in the service without a six-figure salary to pay for physical or mental health treatments to be turned away? That… is some bulls***. And it’s frankly outrageous that someone would begin playing the “welfare queens” card on fellow service members like that. When people enlist part of the agreement with the government that a service member gets is after your service is over the government helps you take care of your medical needs. That’s it. And there’s no whining about the cost because men put their lives on the line.Sorry if we got up on a soapbox there but that’s a topic near and dear to CSGOPOTD’s heart.Anyway that one-off comment wasn’t the only time that Rep. Davidson popped off about who actually “deserves” medical coverage. At his first town hall as a Congressman in early 2017 Davidson was hammered with questions about the GOP’s wishes to repeal the Affordable Care Act even if there was no replacement for it. Thus the following exchange occurred resulting in gasps and boos from those assembled: Constiuent: “My son did not have health insurance for four years until the ACA when Medicaid was accepted. He didn’t have health insurance because he’s in the service industry. And that industry pays minimum wage and they keep their employees below a certain number of hours so that they cannot – so that they don’t have to pay health insurance. So many of the people that are on Medicaid are working and they are the working poor. Under Trumpcare one of the major ways to make health insurance affordable is to bring back catastrophic insurance which is basically no insurance at all. Given that given that preventative health care is the number one way to keep people healthy in our society can you explain why my son and millions of others in his situation are not deserving of affordable decent healthcare that has essential benefits so that he can stay healthy and continue working?”  Warren Davidson: “OK I don’t know anything about your son but as you described him his skills are focused in an industry that doesn’t have the kind of options that you want him to have for health care. So I don’t believe that these taxpayers here are entitled [sic] to give that to him. I believe he’s got the opportunity to go earn those health benefits.”       Yes he pretty much just told a woman that her son deserved to die because he wasn’t “skilled” enough and that he has to “earn” the right to keep living. Great work Warren. Making the GOP look real sympathetic out there. And if you’re wondering if he just misspoke no he doubled down on his statement.  As Republican control of the House was lost in the 2018 Blue Wave election in the last days of the 115TH Congress were winding down Warren Davidson sponsored the “Buy a Brick Build the Wall Act” that would have tried to secure funding for Donald Trump’s stupid f***ing xenophobic and impractically useless idea for a physical wall on the U.S./Mexico border by allowing public donations made (not “Mexico will pay for it”) and even proposed outside of the bill that the United States could use “Wall Coins” accepting donations via Bitcoin to be accepted to fund the project. “(The bill) lets the American people or whomever should choose to donate – Mexicans or otherwise – to donate to the program. You could do with this sort of like crowdfunding site. Or you could even do blockchain and you could have wall coins. But you could raise the money. And frankly if we get it right at the Treasury you could even accept Mexican pesos.”       That… is insane. In more ways than we can count. Including the complete improbability that there are private citizens in Mexico who might want to chip in.      Davidson is also a climate change denier thinks Sharia Law is a threat to the United States and our Constitution (even though the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment would defend against it quite nicely but hey why not be an Islamophobe?) would like to redefine marriage as only between one man and one woman while allowing businesses the “religious freedom” to discriminate against the LGBTQ community and is a supporter of Personhood. If you’re thinking the above two stories might be an indicator that Warren Davidson’s voting record has a mile-wide streak of being uncaring for his fellow Americans you might be right: Now we’ve pointed out that Warren Davidson’s seat in the House was gerrymandered to be one of the safest in the entire state by his predecessor former Speaker John Boehner so unless he gets knocked out of office via a primary challenge  he isn’t going anywhere. However in a sign that the GOP/GQP is still clearly at war with itself he has been feuding publicly with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine whose modest measures to help stop the spread of Covid-19 like mask mandates or closing public venues irked Davidson enough to call DeWine’s moves “Orwellian”. This has caused many to speculate that at some point in the very near future there could be an announcement from Davidson that he’s going to challenge DeWine for the governor’s mansion and leave Washington D.C. Whatever office Davidson runs for we hope he loses and shuffles off into obscurity before he bumblef***s into any ill-conceived ideas he’s got.
