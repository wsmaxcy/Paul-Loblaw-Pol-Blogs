L, GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik Dragged Over 'Cringeworthy' Boast About Trump Support, Lee Moran, 2021-05-11, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) drew scorn on Twitter Monday after she boasted that ex-President Donald Trump has endorsed her as the next House Republican Conference chair. Stefanik wrote she was “honored to earn the support” of Trump whose acolytes are seeking to purge Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) from the House GOP leadership position for her refusal to bow to Trump’s election lies. 🚨🚨🚨 Honored to earn the support for House GOP Conference Chair from President Donald J. Trump 🚨🚨🚨Read his statement from today: pic.twitter.com/C7S3ibOfJl Critics accused Stefanik — who openly backs Trump’s election conspiracies — of selling her soul. They also asked her to define the term “honor.” “Beyond embarrassing. Actually cringe-worthy” said one. So no principles beyond ambition. Got it. What’s the price of selling your soul and integrity What's your definition of "honor"? Beyond embarrassing. Actually cringe-worthy. That ain't no honor.   It's a disgrace. This isn’t something to be proud of. An endorsement by a failed businessman wannabe dictator genocidal psychopath and a presidential loser is not an honor. https://t.co/YYmtibrb8K What good is it for someone to gain the whole world yet forfeit their soul? Mt 8:36 It’s FORMER President Trump! You rarely see anyone who brandishes her lack of character quite so proudly as Elise here. https://t.co/MsgHUantsc I'm not sure that's something to be proud of. 🤮 Gag! Only a giant trashbag full of traitorous trash would be proud to have Trump endorse them--oh wait it's #TrashyStefanik she can't help being the trash that she is. Do you hear me Elise? I said you're a giant bag of traitorous trash who voted to overturn the election trashbag https://t.co/Tn67gXxsfn
