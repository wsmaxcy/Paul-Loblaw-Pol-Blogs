L, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez laid waste to reasons Sinema gives for policy-killing filibuster support, Egberto Willies, 2021-06-27, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) laid waste to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's rationale for her steadfast filibuster support. See full episodes here. In the most cogent fashion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explained in detail why the filibuster deserves absolutely no support. It must go. Chuck Todd read a portion of Senator Kyrsten Sinema’s op-ed defending her support for the filibuster. Would it be good for our country if we did only to see that legislation rescinded a few years from now and replaced by a nationwide voter-ID law or restrictions on voting by mail in federal elections over the objections of the minority? ”Is that a good enough defense” Chuck Todd asked. “for the filibuster?” AOC’s answer was unequivocal. ”No!” AOC replied. “It is essentially an argument of saying why do anything at all in case something in the future may change it. Political systems all across the world pass legislation with majorities and they are fine. And frankly here is the thing. Democratic legislation once enacted is popular.” She pointed out that Republicans have tried to and have been unable to gut Social Security the Affordable Care Act and tried to kill legislation passed by simple majorities and has consistently been unsuccessful. "Democratic policies are popular" AOC said. “And once they are enacted they are difficult to undo.” AOC said she does not believe in defeatism or that good policy would be reversed because one may lose in the future. “Our job is to legislate” AOC said. “Our job is to help people. Our job is to do as much as we can.” The Congresswoman made a prescient statement. She said even if some of their policies are reversed doesn’t having 3 years of policies help better than none? She also called out the unfairness of the Senate as it stands. She pointed out that the 50 Democratic Senators represent many more Americans than the 50 Republican Senators which is a built-in filibuster.
