L, When Will Rep. Conor Lamb Launch His Campaign for U.S. Senate?, Frank RL, 2021-07-04, At this point it’s a waiting game. For at least a month Pennsylvania’s politicos have expressed a near-consensus that the three-term congressman was all but assured to jump into the crowded Democratic primary to replace the retiring Sen. Pat Toomey. Pennsylvania is widely considered one the few Democratic pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. Lamb’s entrance would have national implications for a closely divided Senate. While making no outwardly decisive moves Lamb’s voting record has veered slightly to the left as of late. One factor that may push Lamb into making an announcement soon: Taking full advantage of this quarter to raise funds. With the third quarter having just begun every day Lamb waits to announce is a day of fundraising he loses to Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. Given the fundraising powerhouse that Fetterman has become Lamb needs as much of this quarter as possible to build a war chest that favorably compares to Fetterman who would likely be his chief rival. The most recent public poll that included both Lamb and Fetterman was conducted in May. Among likely Democratic primary voters it showed Fetterman with 40% and Lamb with 21%. That was good enough for second place in that poll but still put Lamb will behind a well-financed frontrunner.  If Lamb intends to announce for U.S. Senate time is now a key factor.
