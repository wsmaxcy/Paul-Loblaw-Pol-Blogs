L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 5/8/21: A child buried long long long ago, DartagnanforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-05-08, Seventy-eight thousand years ago a child died in an area of Africa we now call Kenya. We don’t know the child’s gender or origins. In fact we don’t know much at all about what caused the child’s death. It may have been disease; it may have been a small cut or insect bite that later became infected. It may have been a fall. Or something they ate or drank. Or it may have been none of these things. We don’t know if this child died during the dark of night in the blazing afternoon sunlight or the cool early morning. We don’t know anything about this child’s last meal or whether he/she had any friends protectors or enemies. We don’t know what if any clothing the child wore or anything about how what they saw heard tasted smelled or experienced up until the point of death.   We do know the child was about two and a half to three years old and that someone cared about them.  We can infer from one small bit of forensic knowledge that in fact someone cared for this child quite a lot.  From ArsTechnica: Archaeological evidence suggests that survivors wrapped the small body tightly before laying it curled on one side with the tiny head resting on a pillow in a carefully dug pit in Panga ya Saidi cave. The child’s grave is now the oldest known example of people in Middle Stone Age Africa burying their dead. We don’t know the child’s name but from this point forward she will always be known as Mtoto which is a Swahili word for “child.”  A Spanish paleoanthropologist named Maria Martinon-Torres first located Mtoto’s tiny fragile bone fragments in 2013.  The child’s burial pit was unearthed four years later ten feet below the cave’s floor where the more fulsome remains of the skeleton were found. They found the small grave pit dug into several older layers of sediment in the cave with the pit filled in with a mix of sediment scooped up from the cave floor. Inside a few “fragile and degraded” pieces of bone were all that remained: the base of the skull and part of the lower jaw part of the spine and ribs and some fragments of arm and leg bones. The remains were so fragile that archaeologists had to wrap the whole burial pit in plaster and bring the plaster-wrapped chunk of sediment back to a lab at the Museum of Kenya to excavate under better conditions. A virtual reconstruction of the position in which Mtoto’s remains were found can be viewed here. The archeologists believe that Mtoto was carefully wrapped in a shroud probably made of some animal hide and that the child’s head likely was resting on something presumably for comfort in death. However no shroud pillow or other tangible object buried along with Mtoto was unearthed; these would have decomposed a log time ago. It was only the child’s positioning that provide the clues as to the care taken with the burial: Mtoto lay on the right side with the legs curled up to the chest. The child’s right collarbone and upper ribs had been turned and pressed inward exactly the way archaeologists would expect if someone had wrapped the child’s upper body tightly perhaps with a cloth or hide before burial. Sometime after burial the head and neck had collapsed downward as if a support—maybe a cushion or a wooden block—had decayed away underneath it. A study of the child’s teeth clearly revealed that Mtoto was a member of homo sapiens. The child’s date of burial was determined through optical stimulated luminescence a technique which measures when the material under study was last exposed to sunlight. The discovery of Mtoto was unique because it provided clues about the origins of modern human behavior specifically when the ordinary act of disposing of a dead body gave way instead to showing some type of respect or reverence for the dead a now nearly universal trait of almost all human cultures.  As the ArsTechnica article notes it marks a moment in time when we moved from simply viewing corpses as “something smelly to be removed” and perhaps scavenged by animals to viewing the dead as something we should respect either for its journey to an afterlife or simply to provide some sense of peace or reverence to those left behind. But the discovery of this skeleton was not the first time such behavior had been determined to exist. As Arstechnica notes burial sites found in Europe and the Levant (an area in the Middle East encompassing modern Israel Jordan Syria and part of western Iraq) dated back even further to 120000 years ago. Both Mtoto’s burial site and the sites that predated it fell squarely within the age when modern human behavior such as creating art and jewelry had begun to develop. But the fact that such art and cultural markers had been found to exist far earlier on the African subcontinent make it seem odd that more — and earlier --examples of such burial sites were not found in Africa. One observation is that methods of “laying the dead to rest” vary wildly from culture to culture and many do not involve burying a body but exposing it to the elements or burning it in fire. And there is also a likely relationship to the general climate: [I]in tropical settings like coastal Kenya buried bones don’t always last millennia; even what was left of Mtoto’s skeleton was in a “fragile and degraded” state after all. It’s reasonably likely that for every burial like Mtoto’s there are others that have long since vanished without a trace—lives deaths and afterlives forever beyond knowing. In fact there is some controversial research that suggests a separate species known as homo naledi may have utilized tunnels to carry their dead for placement in what is known as the “Rising Star cave” in South Africa nearly 300000 years ago. As the ArsTechnica article describes this would have constituted a “funeral cache” where bodies were placed but not necessarily buried ceremoniously or otherwise.   Homo naledi were quite a bit different than homo sapiens in appearance and shared characteristics with the even earlier Australopithicus.  While fully capable of walking erect they were far more arboreal spending more time in trees than homo sapiens. They also had slightly smaller brains but were not necessarily less intelligent. Whether they were able to formulate conceptions of respect for the dead or an afterlife however is a matter of hot dispute as is the manner and cause of the placement of their dead in these tunnels. Clearly someone cared about the little homo sapiens child now known as Mtoto though. It seems probable that they were grieved perhaps even inconsolable. Emotions leave even less of a record throughout time so we are left to only imagine based on the little evidence available. But as the article points out one of the most unsettling aspects that has come to light in the discovery of these ancient burial sites is the fact that so many of them — nearly half in fact of all discovered Neanderthal and homo sapiens burial sites  from 120000 years ago to the end of the Pleistocene period (11700 years ago) --were those of children suggesting either high rates of child population child mortality or “likely a combination of both.” In other words the child lived in what we would describe as a cruel and merciless environment. But Mtoto’s methodical burial as revealed with these archeological finds was deliberate temperate and quiet seemingly suffused with some sense of awe perhaps at the mystery and power of a single life suddenly vanished. We will never ever know Mtoto’s story. But for the last few days after reading about what little we do know I can’t seem to stop imagining what it was like.
