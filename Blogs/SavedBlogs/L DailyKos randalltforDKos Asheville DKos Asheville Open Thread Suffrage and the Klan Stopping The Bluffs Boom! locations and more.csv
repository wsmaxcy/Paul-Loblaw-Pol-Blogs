DKos Asheville sharing local since 2011 Mountain Express July 1 2021 by Thomas Calder In early August 1920 the United States was on the verge of historic change. At the time 35 states had ratified the 19th Amendment; one additional state was needed to earn women the right to vote across the land. North Carolina was among the remaining 13 states yet to join the majority in approving the measure. For one Asheville resident resistance was an appropriate stance. In an Aug. 14 1920  letter to the editor a Charles H. Neal told The Asheville Citizen he disapproved of the amendment not because he was opposed to women’s rights but rather because he saw it as a threat to white supremacy. “Dear women of North Carolina the men of the south have gone through fire and blood to protect you against domination by an inferior race of people” Neal wrote. The letter writer went on to quote from N.C. Gov. Thomas Bickett’s Aug. 12 address to the state legislature. Ignoring Bickett’s call to accept “the inevitable” passage of the 19th Amendment Neal highlighted one of the governor’s lingering concerns about the women’s movement — the Black vote. “I greatly fear that woman suffrage would reopen these old questions and force us to fight again the battle for a white government” Bickett declared. Mountain Express June 30 2021 by Letters One of my neighbors on Richmond Hill told me how 25 years ago concerned citizens joined forces to fight off an asphalt plant that was proposed for Riverside Drive. Can you imagine? Not far from where so many good things are happening now. Others tell how downtown Asheville was nearly leveled in 1980 and replaced with a massive shopping mall that would now be an obsolete eyesore and not at all who we are. These stories remind me how mitigation and careful planning are so much less costly than retrofitting. What if those who came before us had allowed such atrocities? These stories remind me that we do not simply live here; we are caretakers of this special place. Where (and for what) do you stand? In all the discussions surrounding The Bluffs megadevelopment being proposed to wipe out a pristine forest next to Asheville’s Richmond Hill Park I have not heard one intelligent/forward-thinking person voice support for this project or explain how dumping thousands of renters along with congested traffic guns and toilets at the end Richmond Hill Drive — a heavily traveled road that has been denied speed humps due to fire safety concerns and sloping toward the third-oldest river in the world — will improve our city or quality of life. Traffic and environmental issues along with living wages infrastructure public safety generational wealth and our very existence are all intertwined. Stop The Bluffs At River Bend Mountain True STOP THE BLUFFS AT RIVER BEND: ACTION NEEDED Sierra Club NC Stop the Bluffs at Riverbend in Woodfin Indivisible Asheville-WNC  WLOS Kimberly King July 2nd 2021 MADISON COUNTY N.C. (WLOS) — Thirty-two miles outside Asheville in rural Madison County there’s a brewery gaining popularity for the very reason that it’s not jammed with Asheville tourists who know about it. Some might call it a best-kept secret. Longtime Ashevillians Chris Donochod and his wife Amy Rubin have long dreamt about opening a place in Hot Springs. The two would often visit the small town that takes a 40-minute drive from Asheville. After years thinking about it the two took the plunge with upwards of $1 million in investment at the site. This July 4 weekend the brewery will have live music for the holiday weekend crowd. In Burnsville in Yancey County John Silver has opened Homeplace Beer Company with a huge two-story space to attract hundreds to relax on a large lawn. MARSHALL - Madison County Sheriff Buddy Harwood's hiring of Det. Anthony Sorangelo provoked a strong reaction from residents throughout the region from people speaking out against the hiring at a county commissioners meeting to the formation of a Back the Blue group to a resolution by commissioners supporting law enforcement. Sorangelo was terminated Sept. 24 by the Asheville Police Department after knocking unconscious a handcuffed man Feb. 11 2020. Sorangelo was charged with simple assault in June 2020. On Feb. 12 this year his case was dismissed. Asheville Police Chief David Zack said that while Sorangelo no longer faces a criminal charge he violated APD's use of force policy. Sorangelo spoke publicly June 29 during an appearance with Harwood on WART's radio show "Community Radio with Liz Gullum." "I remember complaining to my mother 'How could this have happened? What's going on?'" Sorangelo said about his termination. "She said 'You think you've got it bad then remember what they did to Jesus.' WASHINGTON - Here's a look at how area members of Congress voted over the previous week. There were no key votes in the Senate this week. House Vote 1: REGULATING OIL AND NATURAL GAS: The House has passed a resolution (S.J. Res. 14) sponsored by Sen. Martin Heinrich D-N.M. to disapprove of and nullify a September 2020 Environmental Protection Agency rule concerning methane emissions and oil and natural gas production. A supporter Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. D-N.J. said the rule by removing direct limits on the emissions would exacerbate the climate crisis. An opponent Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers R-Wash. said cancelling the rule would do little to protect the environment or reduce methane emissions but would harm American energy security by discouraging natural gas and oil production. The vote on June 25 was 229 yeas to 191 nays. NAYS: Cawthorn R-NC (11th). House Vote 2: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION: The House has passed the National Science Foundation for the Future Act (H.R. 2225) sponsored by Rep.

The bill would change policies regarding the federal government's inspectors general (IG) including requiring the president to notify Congress of removals of inspectors and setting out specific causes including malfeasance that justify removal. Maloney said the bill was a "package of critical reforms to protect IGs from political retaliation and obstruction." An opponent Rep. James Comer R-Ky. said the bill would wrongly hamper the president's ability to get rid of bad inspectors general. The vote on June 29 was 221 yeas to 182 nays. NAYS: Cawthorn R-NC (11th). House Vote 8: CAPITOL BUILDING STATUES: The House has passed a bill (H.R. 3005) sponsored by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer D-Md. that would replace the bust of Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney in the Capitol building with a bust of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and remove statues of people who were in the Confederacy from display. Hoyer said the actions would uphold the principle that "we are a special exceptional country because we lift up the individual and we protect the 1 against the 99 if the 1 is right." An opponent Rep. Barry Loudermilk R-Ga. said the bill failed to adequately account for the input of state legislatures on which statues should replace the statues that the bill would remove.

Michelle Fischbach R-Minn. said the Capitol riot had already been thoroughly investigated and Fischbach called the bill a move by House Democrats to place "partisan divisive politics ahead of the interests of the American people."

DeFazio called it "a transformative bill that will improve mobility economic competitiveness and the quality of life in communities across the country." An opponent Rep. Guy Reschenthaler R-Pa. said it "prioritizes Green New Deal mandates above actual transportation needs." The vote on July 1 was 221 yeas to 201 nays. NAYS: Cawthorn R-NC (11th).
