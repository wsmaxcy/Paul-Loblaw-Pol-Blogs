L, The Inoculation Project 6.27.2021: Circuits seasonal weather and lots of other fun science kits, nomandatesforThe Inoculation Project, 2021-06-27, This week we're helping to provide hands-on materials for science lessons at elementary schools in Morrow Georgia and Alberta Alabama. We hope that readers who support quality public school education will help by sharing or supporting our featured projects.  The Inoculation Project is an ongoing volunteer effort to crowdfund science and math projects for red-state public schools in low-income neighborhoods. As always our conduit is DonorsChoose a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that facilitates tax-deductible donations to specific vetted projects in public schools. This never-before-funded teacher’s elementary school classroom needs a circuit kit starter set and a salinity meter. Resources:  Help me give my students to explore STEM grade-level standards-based experiences in several content areas. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  Tara Elementary School Morrow Georgia Total:  $264.19 Still Needed:  $264.19  $145.66 Teacher’s Comments from Ms. Staples: My Students:  My school is equipped with highly inspiring educators who build a culture of the love of learning and instill that our students can be truly successful and great. In my classroom I provide learning experiences and opportunities that inspire my scholars to lead learn grow academically and persevere. Many of my students learn new aspects of our world that they have not been previously exposed to. My students love to learn and aspire to pursue their dreams. Also according to the U.S. Census 17% of the members of this community have received a bachelor's degree. We need your help to help afford our scholars opportunities to broaden their scope innovative learning experiences and to become prepared to become college and career ready. Our mission is to provide a globally competitive education that empowers students to achieve academic and personal goals and to become college and career ready productive responsible citizens. Thank you in advance for helping our scholars with the necessary educational supplies to facilitate quality activities that will catapult our scholars to be able to reach their true and highest potential. My Project:  These tools will help students have hands-on interactive activities in science concepts related to electricity and more powered by STEM. My students thrive with hands-on activities in a small group setting. My scholars will gain a great understanding of their grade level concepts involving electricity physical and chemical changes and more. Students will build and test various types of circuits explore mixtures containing salt and the engineering design process in STEM with the Lego Build Kit. We will beam with excitement as they apply skills that they have learned in lessons. Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!  Our friend Eastern Bluebird found TIP’s new long-term project. Her preliminary research turned up the following: “According to the Great Schools website ABC Elementary in Alberta AL serves students of a population that is 90% low-income and 99% black.” Resources:  Help me give my students science materials to add to our science center. Economic need:  Nearly all students from low‑income households Location:  ABC Elementary School Alberta Alabama Total:  $592.47 Still Needed:  $492.47  $343.94 Teacher’s Comments from Mrs. Jenorice Hudson-Kennedy: My Students:  I have a group of energetic learners. They are excited about reading and writing. In my kindergarten class we do a lot of hands-on activities. My students learn by doing and working cooperatively. They enjoy playing and working with materials such as magnifying glasses puzzles magnets and more. It may look as if students are just having fun but they are actually learning valuable lessons. My students are constantly moving and growing. They are eager to share new information with their friends. My Project:  There are multiple reasons for science to be a core part of elementary school learning. It can support: (a) development of a knowledgeable citizenry (b) meaningful learning of language and mathematics (c) wonderment about how the natural world works and (d) preparation for STEM-related careers. These materials will allow them to independently use the science center to learn more about the skills we are working on. These materials will help them to have a love of science and nature. Requested materials: Donations of ANY size can make a BIG difference!   With lots of assistance from our generous readers both of last week’s projects were completed! Pre-schoolers in a Head Start classroom in Muncie Indiana will receive materials to use during Outside Exploration. And all grade levels at an elementary school in Harlingen Texas will have opportunities to use the science kits provided through their new Mobile Science Lab. ​Founded in 2009 The Inoculation Project combats the anti-science push in conservative America by funding science and math projects in traditionally red-state classrooms and libraries. Our conduit is DonorsChoose a crowdfunding charity founded in 2000 and highly rated by both Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau among others. Every Sunday we focus on helping to fund science or math projects preferably in neighborhood public schools where the overwhelming majority of students come from low-income households. We welcome everyone who supports public school education — no money is required! Finally here’s our list of successfully funded projects — our series total is 905! The success-list diary also contains links and additional information about DonorsChoose.
