C, Podcast: The 3WHH on The Two Thomases and Natural Law, Steven Hayward, 2021-02-06, Another week another dismal article in The New Republic (a former magazine) to beat up. We promise not to make a habit of this lest TNR get an anti-stalking injunction but this week’s TNR howler “Originalism Is Dead; Long Live Catholic Natural Law” is so stupid that we had to smack it around as another stepping stone to our ongoing conversation about constitutional originalism. Key question: if Thomas Aquinas and Thomas Jefferson were placed in the same room together would they understand and agree with each other? The left mired in historicism thinks not. Harry Jaffa knew better. But along the way we also get in a pillow fight take in some reviews of Kosher whisky (!!) wonder why Iranians are illegally crossing over our southern border and the wonky and obscure clue this week that demonstrates how radical the Biden Administration intends to be. So in other words something for everybody! Speaking of Harry I did look up the quote I paraphrased (badly) in last week’s episode on his 1991 warning that the end of the Cold War was going to make the left more dangerous. The full article is here and here’s the concluding paragraph: The defeat of communism in the USSR and its satellite empires by no means assures its defeat in the world. Indeed the release of the West from its conflict with the East emancipates utopian communism at home from the suspicion of it affinity with an external enemy. The struggle for the preservation of western civilization has entered a new—and perhaps far more deadly and dangerous—phase. But even better is the next to last paragraph which (again written in 1991) describes our current moment with frightening accuracy. Have you happened to notice that the Left goes nuts if you call their current frame of mind “Cultural Marxism”? Well as this passage makes clear they hate the term because it is dead on: “Diversity” is demanded by those who will tolerate no deviation from the “politically correct.” And what is “political correctness” but another name for “the party line”. It is Leninism/Stalinism without Lenin or Stalin. “Racism” is the generic term for any kind of “false (formerly bourgeois) consciousness” that is to say for any opinions not considered politically correct. It has nothing to do with what once was called race prejudice—an unreasonable depreciation of other human beings because of their race color or ethnic origin. The charge of “racism” is made by the very people demanding racial quotas race norming and segregated racial and ethnic centers. To point out the contradiction in these demands—or indeed of any demands made by the politically correct—is to bring on the accusations of “logism” which means the use of reason a vice held characteristic of “Eurocentrism”. The contempt for “Eurocentrism” as an endemic vice corresponds closely to Marx’s contempt for the false consciousness engendered in the ruling classes of all societies founded upon private property. “Racism” itself is then nothing but the endemic quality of human consciousness prior to the transformation of human egotism into human altruism. “Political correctness” is nothing less than the blind and willful insistence upon the fulfillment of the goals of revolutionary Marxism/Leninism without any reference to that failed enterprise itself or to any rational political analysis. Indeed the new political correctness differs from its predecessor only in its insistence that no reason needs to be given as to why it is correct. It is a synthesis of the goals of Marxism with the philosophical (or anti-philosophical) horizon of nihilism. Anyway here’s the sound file to listen here or download from our indulgent hosts over at Ricochet. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
