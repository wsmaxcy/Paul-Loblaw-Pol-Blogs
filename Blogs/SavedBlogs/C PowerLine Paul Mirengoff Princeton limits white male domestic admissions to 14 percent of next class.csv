C, Princeton limits white male domestic admissions to 14 percent of next class*, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-04-07, Princeton has offered admission to its class of 2025 to 1498 applicants. According to  numbers provided by the University around fourteen percent of them are white American males.  14 percent of the admitted applicants identify as international students. 68 percent of the admitted applicants from the U.S. identify as “persons of color.” 52 percent are female. 48 percent are male.  Putting these numbers together we see that only around 28 percent of admittees are white Americans. Less than half of that relatively small group are male.  Whites make up  much more than one-third of American students. Thus whites are severely underrepresented in the group of American students Princeton has admitted to the class of 2025. Princeton’s class of domestic students won’t “look like America” as the saying goes. In its announcement Princeton lumps Asian-American together with Blacks and other minority group members as “persons of color.” Thus we don’t yet know what percentage of those offered admission belong to which minority group.  We also don’t know how many of the small group of white American males whom Princeton admitted denounced their white maleness in their “personal statement.” Even if that’s not a prerequisite it’s probably a good strategy.  Princeton assures us that in the admissions process “the University remained committed to a holistic review process.” In the hope that Princeton is sued for what looks like racial discrimination I say “tell it to the judge.”  * As explained  here the original version of this article mistakenly put the percentage of white male Americans admitted at around 9 percent.
