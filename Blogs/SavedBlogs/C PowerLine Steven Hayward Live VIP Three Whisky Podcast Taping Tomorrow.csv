C, Live VIP Three Whisky Podcast Taping Tomorrow, Steven Hayward, 2021-01-07, All right by what should perhaps be described as “unpopular” demand we’re arranging a last-minute VIP webcast tomorrow afternoon at 6 pm Eastern (3 pm Pacific) with a twist: It will be a modified form of the Three Whisky Happy Hour podcast taping in which I’ve invited Charles Lipson of the University of Chicago to team up with me. (His latest article on the state of things is in The Spectator.) This way we’ll only be outnumbered by “Lucretia” instead of being merely overmatched. It might almost be a fair fight. John Hinderaker will join us too mostly to keep order I suspect and give a standing eight-count with each thrashing Lucretia delivers. We’ll also try to respond to audience questions and comments. Lucretia tells me she’s hearing from a lot of Power Line readers and listeners who say “I’m DONE with Power Line but would like to hear what you have to say about what’s the matter with those guys!” So now you—and she—will get their chance as we kick around what to make of this week’s events in Washington and beyond. Great time to sign up to be a VIP if you’re not already and even better if you’re mad at us: think of it as a the virtual/digital equivalent of the dunk tank at the carnival. If you’re a VIP member you’ll get an email with the link tomorrow around mid-day. Speaking of which after Scott’s post a couple weeks ago about being a “noodle” over the election fraud controversy a reader with time on his hands sent along the following photoshop:  As it happens I’ve been wanting to do something like this with the Abbey Road album cover photo but I’m not handy enough with Photoshop. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
