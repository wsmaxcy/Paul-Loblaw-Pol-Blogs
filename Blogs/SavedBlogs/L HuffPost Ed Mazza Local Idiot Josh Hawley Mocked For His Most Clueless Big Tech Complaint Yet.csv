L, 'Local Idiot' Josh Hawley Mocked For His Most Clueless Big Tech Complaint Yet, Ed Mazza, 2021-04-28, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) promoted his new book railing against “big tech” in the most awkward way possible: via big tech.  Hawley one of the ringleaders of the Jan. 6 attempt in Congress to overturn the election results based on lies and conspiracy theories complained on Tuesday about a vague conspiracy against his anti-tech book by “corporate media and the woke mob.”  Just one problem: He made that gripe on Twitter... via an iPhone... with a link promoting the book on Amazon.com: The corporate media and the woke mob don’t want you to read this book. They tried to cancel it. They failed. One week until publication - order here https://t.co/Qw1Bovt4Xh On Jan. 6 Hawley raised a fist of support to a crowd of pro-Trump protesters in Washington D.C. just hours before many of those same people attacked the U.S. Capitol. Afterward he continued to object to certifying the election results in two states in an attempt to cancel out millions of American votes.   Hawley’s actions cost him donors as well as his initial book deal although he quickly found a new publisher. He has since complained ceaselessly about being censored and has done so unironically via numerous national TV appearances a front-page editorial in The New York Post and presumably in his forthcoming book.  Hawley’s latest tweet ― using big tech to complain about big tech while promoting his book on big tech for sale via big tech ― caused his name to trend on Twitter as critics called him out for one of his most clueless comments yet: To market his book Josh Hawley used an iPhone Twitter and Amazon. More censorSHOP than censorship. https://t.co/BnaHMtftL8 “Amazon is oppressing me. Buy my book on Amazon.” - Local Idiot https://t.co/AYRrwTo395 You’re hawking this on big tech you traitorous rube. https://t.co/pSfIc90WKk Josh Hawley: FUCK YOU BIG TECH AND WOKE MOBAlso Josh Hawley: Tweets Amazon link to book that is readily available presumably from a device owned by a major tech company. https://t.co/ncgaYubghZ This is actually impressive. The Tyranny of Big Tech purchasable on Amazon advertised on Twitter tweeted from an Apple iPhone. https://t.co/SuSCIEAADn Is the Amazon link a troll or a mark of genuine cognitive limitations? https://t.co/0h2azdHtxL Hey I see what you did there! You used big tech to promote your book on the tyranny of big tech! Can’t wait to crack open a meat beer and not read it. https://t.co/EB1ZtPR4pc “Read about the tyranny of big tech” he tweeted with his iPhone. “Order on Amazon.” https://t.co/5TKW7JHb0i No Josh. You lost the first contract because you tried to "cancel" American constitutional democracy to promote your insatiable personal ambition. Outside of MAGA-world the rest of us remember. https://t.co/Q8qhHZoRZS I wonder how many the @GOPChairwoman and the @GOP will buy with donor funds. https://t.co/p32iEVbqiK
