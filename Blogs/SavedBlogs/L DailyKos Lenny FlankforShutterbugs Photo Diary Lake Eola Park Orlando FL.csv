L, Photo Diary: Lake Eola Park Orlando FL, Lenny FlankforShutterbugs, 2021-07-03, This is one of my favorite spots to hang out in whenever I am in Orlando. There’s always lots of birdies and turtles to look at. Some photos from a walk at Lake Eola Park. For those who don't know I live in a converted campervan and travel around the country posting photo diaries of places that I visit.  :)
