L, In 4th Grade After School I Would Go Looking For Change In Pay Phones-So We Could Eat., Rule of Claw, 2021-07-03, Poverty is misery in all facets of existence.  One of the things is robs you of is self-esteem.  As a kid you are measured by other kids kids who wear Nikes or Bugle Boy or Girbaud.  Kids who have all the toys and none of the respect.  If you are poor especially in Texas something is wrong with you.  Not society.  Not the economy.  You.  Particularly in the 1980’s. Poverty is punishment we are taught by my teachers neighbors and of course fellow classmates.  But when we needed more cash because the air conditioning or the car needed repairs we didn’t have title loans or credit cards to fall back on.  We didn’t have home equities at the drop of a hat. My Grandpa until he got sick collected aluminum cans plus worked 40 hours.  My Mom mowed lawns and worked full-time too.  In Reagan’s America as is frequently the case now two full time jobs was just enough to need more. My Grandma mostly yelled a lot but I still love and miss her.  Thursday was a tough day.  Payday was Friday so if we came up short that would be the gap day.  For those of you that read my tonsilitis saga you might remember how hard it was to sit there for days until the paycheck came.  So mostly on Wednesdays my Mom would pick me up from school and take me to local retail and such to find vending machines payphones newspaper machines to take my fingers and look for change. Literally.  She would go inside the store while I did it because if a little boy does it it is cute but if a Mom does it she looks desperate and might get security called on her.  We would hit local Bryan TX retail and strip malls groceries anywhere we knew there could bequa change.  Sometimes I would find a good amount over the evening four or five dollars bought a bit of food back then.  Sometimes not and on those days I would feel like a failure making a bad situation even worse. Most times though I did ok.  But I would be out until dusk a lot of times and come back tired.  I often was too tried to finish my homework so I would do it at breakfast or get to my homeroom early.  I might have been impoverished but I was not lacking ability.  I could breeze through the assignment as long as I could stay awake to do it. I look back on this with no joy.  But also no shame.  My experiences developed my empathetic side but I also feel they embittered me even more to my dad.  See my Mom was young.  At 17 she was capable of being a model.  But having a kid ate up her youth.  I saw her age and wear down and it made me feel guilty for being born though she promised to hand me my hiney if she ever heard me say it. Not having a partner having a husband abandon her and her son is something she never got over.  It is something that cut deeply and wounded her emotionally.  She got old internally before it was her time.  So no I don’t look back at that era with shame.  Sadness yes.  But I was not some kind of hooligan.  I was good in school I listened to instruction and generally stayed on the right side of parental law.  I think in some respect I just saw this young woman struggle into middle then senior age having known her at what should have been the peak of her youth and wonder if she ever felt let down.  Or if she ever felt beaten down.   As I write this I am now home.  My ulcer is flaring my head is pounding and my belly is swollen.  I don’t sense much time left for me.  At one point in my life I would think about the long term now I just try to maximize each day.   Society may have let a child and his family down-but for the most part they didn’t humor me.  They let me know at an early age they thought I was worthless.  And you know what?  I go on Facebook sometimes to see what they are up to.  After all this time they still are mostly the same vapid superficial narcissists they always were.  I would love to report back a different result.  I would love to tell you that they did not graduate from bragging about designer jeans to custom trucks but that would be a lie. The thing is about cancer I can’t shake is if I don’t get further along win an election pass a law expand my newsletter into TV or radio build a real foundation for change would I really have been worth all she gave up?  Her health her youth would I really expect her to take it all into account and say “Yes this worked out.”   I stuck my fingers into machines to find change so we could eat.  Wasn’t I supposed to be more by 44?  Wasn’t I supposed to be that kid who rose above it all and showed ‘em?”   But then I think maybe I have.  I write I create I have built a couple of different organizations from scratch-but no that is not it. I worked on elections I helped fight for Obamacare but no that is not it either. No in the end I achieved victory over those classmates not because of wealth or power but because I grew up to be the kind of person that does not post pictures of his car or his man cave or his gun. I post pictures of my family the family I stand by that I help support that I love.  I post pics of my brother and my mom and of course my wife.  I overcame and outperformed them because I understand what is important-the people you love.  They are what matters not some truck or leather jacket or pair of sunglasses.   It took me 34 years to realize I did not put my fingers in payphones just because I had to.  I did it because I wanted to.  I wanted to help the family I wanted to see us through.   You can buy a mansion.  Without love it is just a house.   Love is going to Wal-Mart then Jewel then Skagg’s and on and on in phone after phone in soda machine after soda machine until you are exhausted but have enough for some hot dogs.  Love is two fingers in a pay phone fishing for some change because you came this far let’s spring for buns! Love is a home even if it isn’t fancy.   See someone out there someday is going to read this that needs to.  Maybe today maybe years from this day in a random search for retro cool who knows?  But someone is going to find it that needs to know they are not lesser for being less well-heeled.  That they are every bit equal to the braggarts wasting the earth’s resources on grandiosity.  The waitress with a sore back the nurse with blisters on their foot the trucker who has to miss birthdays to not miss the mortgage payment. And when you read this it will trigger your own “did what ya had to” memory.  Don’t cry.  Smile.  Smile because you are tough.  Smile because you are valuable.  Smile because you are worth every second or your life and every breath of air you took in.  Don’t let anyone I mean anybody place a negative value on you-especially those that can’t properly define what constitutes value in the first place. We are worth it.  We have purpose.  And all I ask is that when you do collect enough of life’s quarters to show off-you don’t.  That when you sit in someone’s man cave and they start showing off their toys you respond like me:  “Let me show you my family.  This is my mom.  She used to get up at 3 a.m. to make donuts and then would mow lawns in Texas summers all so I could eat and have shelter.  This is my wife.  She does more on 25 percent of her kidney function than most could do with 100.  This is my baby brother-he is on the spectrum but still taught himself video editing. You were saying something about a truck?” -ROC Hey friends my cancer fight has turned more serious and has forced me to urgently change careers!  And-huge news!  My newsletter is live! Sign up here to subscribe!  It publishes every Wednesday and will be full of original reporting laughs and fun!
