The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021 authorizes about $35 billion over five years to improve leaky pipes and upgrade facilities and is widely supported by lawmakers and their states back home. This time though it could be so much more — a building block in Biden’s broader $2.3 trillion proposal to invest in roads bridges and other infrastructure. Senators overwhelmingly approved the measure 89-2 in what Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. called “a great example” of what’s possible in Congress. Dozens injured in stampede at big Israeli religious festival More than 100 people were injured dozens critically in a stampede at a Jewish religious gathering in northern Israel attended by tens of thousands of people Israel’s main rescue service said early Friday. Magen David Adom tweeted that it was treating 103 people including 38 in critical condition. Israeli media had earlier reported that a grandstand collapsed but the rescue service said all the injuries happened in a stampede. Israeli media reported that up to 38 people were killed but the rescue service did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. The Ynet news website was among those reporting the figure and published a photo appearing to show several bodies. 5 arrested in violent robbery of Lady Gaga’s dogs The woman who returned Lady Gaga’s stolen French bulldogs was among five people arrested in connection with the theft and shooting of the music superstar’s dog walker Los Angeles police said Thursday. Detectives do not believe that the thieves initially knew the dogs belonged to the pop star the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. The motive for the Feb. 24 robbery investigators believe was the value of the French bulldogs — which can run into the thousands of dollars. The dog walker Ryan Fischer is recovering from a gunshot wound and has called the violence “a very close call with death” in social media posts. He was walking Lady Gaga’s three dogs — named Asia Koji and Gustav — in Hollywood just off the famed Sunset Boulevard when he was attacked. Video from the doorbell camera of a nearby home shows a white sedan pulling up and two men jumping out. They struggled with Fischer and one pulled a gun and fired a single shot before fleeing with two of the dogs Koji and Gustav. US vows again to ban menthol flavor in cigarettes cigars U.S. health regulators pledged again Thursday to try to ban menthol cigarettes this time under pressure from African American groups to remove the mint flavor popular among Black smokers. The Food and Drug Administration has attempted several times to get rid of menthol but faced pushback from Big Tobacco members of Congress and competing political interests in both the Obama and Trump administrations. Any menthol ban will take years to implement and will likely face legal challenges from tobacco companies. Thursday’s announcement is the result of a lawsuit filed by anti-smoking and medical groups last summer to force the FDA to finally make a decision on menthol alleging that regulators had “unreasonably delayed” responding to a 2013 petition seeking to ban the flavor. Al Jazeera News India sees new record COVID cases and deaths as crisis deepens India’s total COVID-19 cases have passed 18 million after another world record number of daily infections as gravediggers worked around the clock to bury victims and hundreds more were cremated in makeshift pyres in parks and parking lots. India reported 379257 new infections and 3645 new deaths on Thursday health ministry data showed the highest number of fatalities in a single day since the start of the pandemic. However medical experts believe India’s true COVID-19 numbers may be five to 10 times greater than the official tally. The world’s second-most populous nation is in deep crisis with its hospitals and morgues overwhelmed. Each day thousands of Indians search frantically for hospital beds and life-saving oxygen for sick relatives using social media apps and personal contacts. Hospital beds that become available especially in intensive care units (ICUs) are snapped up in minutes. Families mourn as Brazil hits 400000 COVID deaths Nicole Martins had hoped her mother hospitalised with COVID-19 last month was on the mend. But when the 24-year-old arrived at the hospital the look on her father’s face confirmed her worst fears. “I thought she was getting out” Martins told Al Jazeera. “But then I got there and saw my dad in tears.” The Martins are one of hundreds of thousands of Brazilian families who have lost a loved one to COVID-19 since the coronavirus first began spreading across the country like wildfire. On Thursday the South American nation surpassed 400000 coronavirus-related deaths the second-highest total in the world after the United States. More than half of those were recorded in 2021 while April has been the deadliest month since the start of the pandemic. ‘I’m a horrible skeleton’: Navalny in court after hunger strike In his first public appearance since ending a weeks-long hunger strike jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny looked visibly thinner in a court hearing which he attended via video link. Thursday’s hearing was linked to Navalny’s appeal against a defamation conviction handed to him in February for allegedly insulting a World War II veteran. He was ordered to pay a fine of 850000 rubles ($11500) over the case. During the hearing he addressed his wife Yulia who was in the courtroom. “I was taken to a bania [Russian sauna] yesterday to look good today. I looked at myself – I’m a horrible skeleton. I’m in a horrible shape as if I’m in seventh grade” he said. US Supreme Court hands victory to immigrants facing deportation The United States Supreme Court on Thursday offered new hope to thousands of long-term immigrants seeking to avoid deportation in a ruling that faulted the US government for improperly notifying a man who had come illegally from Guatemala to appear for a removal hearing. In a 6-3 decision that divided the high court’s conservative bloc the justices overturned a lower court’s decision that had prevented Agusto Niz-Chavez from pursuing his request to cancel the attempted expulsion based on the length of time he has lived in the United States. Niz-Chavez lives in Michigan with his family after entering the US irregularly in 2005. The justices decided that federal immigration law requires authorities to include all relevant details for a notice to appear for a hearing in one document rather than sending the information across multiple documents. The ruling could affect hundreds of thousands of immigration cases. Need a tissue?

Destination Dubai: Jets in demand to escape India’s COVID horror Indians from the millions-strong expat community in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stranded in their homeland during a catastrophic coronavirus surge are swamping private jet operators with requests to whisk them back to safety. Fearing a prolonged flight ban between India and the Gulf state they aim to use an exemption for private business planes that was in effect last year during the first wave of the global crisis. An estimated 3.5 million Indians live and work in the UAE. The latest suspension of flights that came into force on Sunday has shut down some 300 commercial flights that operated weekly on one of the world’s busiest air corridors.

Good News Network Scientists Make Microplastics Breakthrough Devising Method to Trap And Remove Them Microbiologists have found a way to use bacteria to trap microplastics removing them from the environment and making them easier to recycle. The new technique developed by scientists at Hong Kong Polytechnic University uses bacterial biofilms—a sticky substance created by micro-organisms—to trap microplastic particles. The biofilm is then processed and dispersed releasing the microplastic particles for processing and recycling. Microplastics are hugely problematic and pose a major risk to food chains and human health according to Researcher Yang Liu: “They are not easily bio-degradable where they retain in the ecosystems for prolonged durations. This results in the uptake of microplastics by organisms leading to transfer and retention of microplastics down the food chain. “Due to their huge surface area and adsorption capacity microplastics can adsorb toxic pollutants such as pesticides heavy metals and drug residues at high concentrations.
