L, Hands-on science, OjibwaforStreet Prophets, 2021-06-29, Welcome to the Street Prophets Coffee Hour cleverly hidden at the intersection of religion and politics. This is an open thread where we can share our thoughts and comments about the day. While many people in the United States are anti-science and lacking in adequate science education I thought it might be interesting to look at some hands-on science today. Museums are not always place where people just look at “stuff.” Some museums emphasize a hands-on experience. At the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) in Portland Oregon the museum seeks to inspire curiosity through engaging science learning experiences foster experimentation and the exchange of ideas and stimulate informed action. Here children their parents adults teenagers and even respected elders can interact with learn from and be entertained by a number of science exhibits.              This is an open thread—all topics are welcome.
