L, School reopening and a major vaccination gap, DButch, 2021-07-06, The Seattle Times this morning has an article on “the other vaccination problem” that’s becoming evident as the start of the first school year since the lockdown has been (mostly) eased up.  A lot of children have not been receiving the vaccinations normally required to attend school.  It turns out telemedicine doesn’t do a good job at that.  (Who could have predicted etc.) A lot of vaccination boxes have gone unchecked and unless parents were willing to bring their kids in for an in-person visit many went without vaccinations.  So a lot of kids 18 and under are not vaccinated or up to date for common diseases such as chickenpox measles mumps and rubella. Now public health officials and clinicians are scrambling to catch up. The number of vaccines given to kids 18 and under in Washington has dropped by hundreds of thousands compared to prepandemic levels new state and federal data show. In April 2020 there was a decrease of 70% to 80% in doses administered to children 4-17 compared with the average from the past five years.  Rules have also tightened up for the upcoming school year (they were actually tightened last year but with a lot of remote schooling and part time schooling that was not generally enforced) and families are required to provide a copy of “medically verified immunization records” or a valid exemption before their children are allowed to attend school in person this year (at least in WA your mileage may vary). This is a problem across the US: The data from Washington state mirror the data that we’re seeing nationally... According to Dr. Dimitri Christakis pediatrician and director of the Center for Child Health Behavior and Development at Seattle Children’s. Gonna be a wild new school year if “we” don’t get cracking really fast — and the upsurge in anti-Vaccine nuttery is going to cause some troubles on top of the normal problems of having to rapidly accelerate vaccine delivery into arms.
