C, Is America failing the “Twitter test”?, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-02-12,  This essay by the great Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky (with Gil Troy) is as insightful and effective a takedown of the Soviet Union as can be written in a short-to-midlength essay. Sharansky’s father was a creative writer and journalist; Sharansky was a scientist. By describing how the totalitarian Soviet government oppressed artists journalists and scientists Sharanksy paints a truly chilling picture. The Soviets forced intelligent members of these professions and a great many other citizens to become what Sharansky calls “doublethinkers.”  
As the Party Line you follow publicly becomes increasingly disconnected from what you believe or see or experience privately your cynicism grows along with your mental agility—your skill in living and writing in two contradictory scripts at once. That’s how you become a doublethinker.
 At the end of the essay Sharansky applies the lessons he learned under Soviet communism to the United States. He writes: 
The feeling of release from the fear and giddy relief when crossing the line from doublethink to democratic dissent is also universal across cultures. This understanding prompted the Town Square Test I use to distinguish between free societies and fear societies: Can you express your individual views loudly in public without fear of being punished legally formally in any way? If yes you live in a free society; if not you’re in a fear society. In the West today the pressure to conform doesn’t come from the totalitarian top — our political leaders are not Stalinist dictators. Instead it comes from the fanatics around us in our neighborhoods at school at work often using the prospect of Twitter-shaming to bully people into silence—or a fake politically-correct compliance.  Recent polls suggest that nearly two-thirds of Americans report self-censoring about politics at least occasionally essentially becoming a nation of doublethinkers despite the magnificent constitutional protections for free thought and expression enshrined in the Bill of Rights To preserve our integrity and our souls the quality of our political debate and the creativity so essential to our cultural life we need a Twitter Test challenging bottom-up cultural totalitarianism that is spreading throughout free societies. That test asks: In the democratic society in which you live can you express your individual views loudly in public and in private on social media and at rallies without fear of being shamed excommunicated or cancelled?  Ultimately whether you will live as a democratic doublethinker doesn’t depend on the authorities or on the corporations that run social media platforms: it depends on you. Each of us individually decides whether we want to submit to the crippling indignity of doublethink or break the chains that keep us from expressing our own thoughts and becoming whole.
 (Emphasis added) Increasingly and to alarming degree America is failing the Twitter test. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
