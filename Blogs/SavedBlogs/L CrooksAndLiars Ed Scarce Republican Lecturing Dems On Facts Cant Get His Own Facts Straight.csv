L, Republican Lecturing Dems On 'Facts' Can't Get His Own Facts Straight, Ed Scarce, 2021-06-25, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  This sort of basic stupidity happens so often with Cawthorn Greene Boebert etc that it makes one think it's all deliberate that they do this intentionally so as to gain even more attention than their otherwise banal barely literate comments would command. That's my working theory anyway. I could be wrong. Source: Raw Story A Republican from North Carolina was ridiculed on Monday after making a hilarious blunder while attempting to lecture Democrats about facts. Rep. Madison Cawthorne (R-NC) was homeschooled as a child and then attended a single semester of college during which he "earned mostly D's." On Thursday Cawthorne demonstrated his intelligence during a speech on the House floor about facts. "It was Thomas Jefferson that said 'Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or the dictates of our passions they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.' Let's cast our eyes over the facts shall we" he said. The quote that Cawthorne misattributed to Jefferson is actually a famous quote by John Adams. As usual Twitter just amplified the attention that Cawthorn craves. That wasn’t Thomas Jefferson it was John Adams. What an ignorant posturing jackweasel. https://t.co/7Yx4LwEW5t — Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) June 24 2021 just one of the stupidest people in congress acyn i mean gohmert level stupidity — darth™ (@darth) June 24 2021 It's a fact that John Adams said that.It's a fact that Cawthorn doesn't factcheck. pic.twitter.com/BxMC8cl2jE — Stray Political Cat (@StrayPolitical) June 24 2021 Honestly his "communications" staff is not doing him any favors and might really dislike/hate him. Kind of like Meghan McCains hair stylist. — DebbieM NO FBR Lists!*Biden/Harris Senate/House!* (@MaukDebbie) June 24 2021 CNN notices a pattern. In the last 10 months Cawthorn has wrongly said in a speech that James Madison signed the Declaration of Independence wrongly said Congress voted to have Lincoln issue the Emancipation Proclamation and now in another speech attributed a famous John Adams line to Jefferson. https://t.co/zLTXcPOXZv — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) June 25 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
