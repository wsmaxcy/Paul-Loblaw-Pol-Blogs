L, Liveblog II:  Defense Closing and Rebuttal: Chauvin Murder Trial, gchaucer2forCommunity Live Bloggers, 2021-04-19, I figured we needed another diary prior to the lunch break.  The morning was consumed with the Prosecution’s closing.  It was brilliant and concise.  Attorney Schleicher put a human face on George Floyd while putting a demonic face on Chauvin.  He adeptly pre-demolished the defense’s closing.  He clarified the elements of the three counts — Second Degree Murder Third Degree Murder Negligent Homicide. Liveblog updates on the present trial session are found in the comment thread. Many thanks to the erudite commenters who add so much value to the discussion! The liveblog schedule has been two posts per day covering the morning and afternoon court sessions.
