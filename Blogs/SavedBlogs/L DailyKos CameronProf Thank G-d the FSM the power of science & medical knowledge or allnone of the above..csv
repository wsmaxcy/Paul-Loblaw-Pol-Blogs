L, Thank G-d the FSM the power of science & medical knowledge or all/none of the above., CameronProf, 2021-07-05, I have spent the last 3 weeks or so of the last 5 weeks in and out of the hospital.  I just got out tonight and I wanted to take the time for the folks who sent me a KosMail email or Facebook message making sure that I was OK.  I went in for chest pain and left sided weakness. I have a history of angina and a heart attack so whenever chest pain rears its ugly head off I go to the hospital.  The pain just turned out to be angina not a heart attack though it does not make the pain any better with that knowledge.  More concerning to me is the deadness in my left side most of the feeling has come back to the arm but the leg is a different story. I was born with mild CP so I have always had problems with my left leg. One of the reasons I am now in a nursing home is that with age and arthritis the strength of the leg has gotten a lot weaker and whenever I put pressure on it it buckles at the knee to where I can only stand for very short times or walk a few feet only with a walker before the pain and weakness kicks in.  Turns out I had another stroke so they kept me in the hospital for about a week running a battery or tests. It was either go to PT back at the hospital I was at (Of which I am no real fan of) or come “home” and have PT OT and ST here. I’d rather be where my “stuff is (Thanks George Carlin) so I opted to come home. Unlike before when the leg felt pain more than deadness now it feels a lto less of everything.  Anyway I am back replied to some emails but thought I’d write a diary and say it is good to be back.
