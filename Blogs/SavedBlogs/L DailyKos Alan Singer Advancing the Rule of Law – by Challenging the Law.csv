L, Advancing the Rule of Law – by Challenging the Law, Alan Singer, 2021-06-27, This is the text of a presentation I made for the Macon B. Allen Black Bar Association of Queens County New York at their Law Day/Juneteenth commemoration on June 17 2021. Macon Bolling Allen was the first practicing African American attorney in the United States. In 1844 Allen passed the bar exam in Maine. He became a Massachusetts Justice of the Peace in 1847. After the Civil War Allen moved to South Carolina where he established a law firm served as a judge and was part of the effort to challenge racist practices and create a more just legal system in the South. I ended the presentation as my alter-ego the rapper Reeces Pieces. Advancing the Rule of Law – by Challenging the Law Saturday June 19 is Juneteenth. It commemorates the day in 1865 that General Gordon Granger of the United States Army issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston Texas to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation. In some ways Juneteenth highlights a problem with law. The Emancipation Proclamation was an Executive Order declared by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1 1863 but at the time the national government had no ability to enforce the decree in the rebelling Confederate States. The 13th Amendment passed by Congress on January 31 1865 was not ratified by the required 3/4th of the states until December 6 1865. With the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9 1865 cotton planters in East Texas knew that the war was over and formerly enslaved Africans were now free but until the United States Army took control of Texas they simply evaded the law because they remained in power. Those in power frequently use misuse or ignore the law to their own benefit. I am a historian and an activist not a lawyer. I am also a white man and I appreciate you inviting me to speak today. I don’t study Black history. What I will talk about today is American history an American history where race and racism are often at its center. At City College in the 1960s I decided to become a teacher and not a lawyer because a lawyer is pledged to uphold the law.  In New York State every lawyer takes an oath of office. “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the State of New York and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of [attorney and counselor-at-law] according to the best of my ability.” I can’t take that pledge because the Constitution of the United States has so often in American history been used to deny fundamental rights to African Americans. In 1857 speaking for the Supreme Court majority in Dred Scott v. Sandford Chief Justice Roger Taney declared that people of African ancestry were “not included and were not intended to be included under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the contrary they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings who had been subjugated by the dominant race and whether emancipated or not yet remained subject to their authority and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them.” This remained the law of the land until after the Civil War and passage of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868 redefined citizenship to include “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.” Although it also promised “due process of law” that promise for African Americans was rarely kept in the past and is still frequently denied in the present. In 1852 Frederick Douglass a self-emancipated former slave was invited to deliver an Independence Day speech in Rochester New York. In the speech Douglass demanded to know “What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days of the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty an unholy license; your national greatness swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants brass-fronted impudence; our shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him mere bombast fraud deception impiety and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.”   The problem with law for me and I suspect for many of us is what to do when the law is fundamentally unjust and must be challenged either through legal or extra-legal means. In his Letter from a Birmingham Jail addressed to local white clergy while he was imprisoned during 1963 civil rights protests in that city the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about the reason for civil disobedience in violation of the law. “‘Why direct action? Why sit ins marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?’ You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.” Dr. King continued “You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ‘How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?’ The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws . . . An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself.” I see law as a tool that can be used to advance justice but justice must be the fundamental principle. Thurgood Marshall in Reflections on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution decried it as “defective from the start . . . when the unpleasant truth of the history of slavery in America is mentioned during this bicentennial year that the Constitution was a product of its times and embodied a compromise which under other circumstances would not have been made. But the effects of the framers’ compromise have remained for generations. They arose from the contradiction between guaranteeing liberty and justice to all and denying both to Negroes.” African Americans were “enslaved by law emancipated by law disenfranchised and segregated by law.”  Because he was a civil rights activist who tried to use the legal system as a weapon against unjust law after his Supreme Court confirmation hearing five Southern Senators voted not to recommend his nomination because “It is clearly a disservice to the Constitution and the country to appoint a judicial activist to the Supreme Court at any time.”  Despite being a legal activist as a judge Marshall understood the limits of law. In May 1981 he wrote: "Our central function is to act as neutral arbiters of disputes that arise under the law . . . We must not reach for a result that we in our arrogance believe will further some goal not related to the concrete case before us.” We were all heartened by the jury’s decision convicting Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. It remains to be clear if we witnessed a change in direction or a legal exception because the evidence against Chauvin was so overwhelming. On-duty police officers are rarely charged with a serious crime especially with murder or manslaughter when they kill an African-American man or woman. Even when they are charged only about a third are convicted. None of the Louisville Kentucky police officers responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor faced criminal charges. Criminal law permits police tremendous freedom to use deadly force based on their judgment and biases. After an incident police benevolent organizations and politicians rush to defend officers who kill unarmed Black civilians the legal system gives police the benefit of the doubt and juries especially white jurors believe their stories or the web of excuses presented by defense attorneys who transfer blame to the victim especially when it is a Black male victim. Since 2015 police officers have fatally shot at least 135 unarmed Black men and women. At least 75% of the officers were white. Many of these white police officers have been involved in two or more deadly shootings without facing any legal consequences. The police officer that killed Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri and the three police officers responsible for the death of Eric Garner in New York City were never placed on trial. The police officer that murdered 17-year old Laquan McDonald in Chicago was sentenced to only six years nine months in prison despite being convicted of second-degree murder. Right now with see Republican office holders in a number of states perverting justice by passing laws to prevent people from voting. These laws are specifically designed to deny the right to vote to Black and Latino American citizens but they are written in a way that pretends neutrality in order to skirt constitutional and legal prohibitions against racial discrimination. At the same time Republicans in the United States House of Representatives and Senate are mobilized to block a federal law guaranteeing the right to vote. They raise a false claim that the new state laws are intended to protect the sanctity of the ballot while in actuality they are intended to steal the 2024 Presidential election and return racists in power. If the Supreme Court with a six-to-three right-wing majority upholds the constitutionality of these anti-voting laws the insurrection of January 6 will be institutionalized in the United States. How can American lawyers with integrity and a commitment to justice abide by their pledge to “support the Constitution of the United States” once it has been seized and reinterpreted to deny fundamental democratic rights? As a New York City teacher you need to be able to rap to have street credibility. Young people know me as the rapper Reeces Pieces. They call me Reeces Pieces because I am better than Eminem. I want to end my presentation as Reeces Pieces sampling one of my favorite rock songs from the 1960s “Street Fighting Man” by the Rolling Stones.  Say Ev'rywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet. 'Cause summer's here and the time is right for marching in the street. Ask what should people like us doWith degrees and fancy jobsIn these sleepy COVID timesThere's just no place to stand on the side lines. Hey Think the time is right for a legal revolution'Cause where we live no games to play compromise is no solution Ask what should people like us doWith degrees and fancy jobsIn these sleepy COVID timesThere's just no place to stand on the side lines. Yo! They dis the young who call for disturbancePolice crack their heads for rights there’s no observanceAsk what should people like us doWith degrees and fancy jobsIn these sleepy COVID timesThere's just no place to stand on the side lines. So what should a lawyer do while people are marching in the street?  What can a lawyer do to defend justice whatever the law says?  What can a lawyer do to create new law that builds a more just society? Will we stand on the sidelines? These are questions that we all must answer.
