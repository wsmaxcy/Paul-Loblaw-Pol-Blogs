L, MSNBC Supercut Bashes Rudy Giuliani With His Most ‘Unhinged’ Election Rants, Lee Moran, 2021-04-29, MSNBC’s Ari Melber suggested Wednesday that Rudy Giuliani’s “bonkers” rants during and after the 2020 election now make “a tad more sense.” After federal agents raided Giuliani’s Manhattan home and office in an escalation of their investigation into his business dealings in Ukraine Melber reminded viewers how the former New York mayor ― as Donald Trump’s personal attorney ― assisted the then-president’s schemes to overturn the election result. “Donald Trump tried several different plots to cheat in the election and to go after Biden” recalled Melber. “He tried to cheat against Biden before there was any voting with Giuliani pushing this Ukraine probe which is now under investigation. And Trump tried to cheat after the vote ... with Giuliani going around the country trying to find people to change vote tallies.” Melber then aired a montage of Giuliani’s “increasingly desperate baroque and unhinged set of performances as those legal lines to contest the race closed up” following the election.

It would have been absurdly funny if it wasn’t so serious” said Melber. “But as bonkers as it was it also now makes a tad more sense tonight from Giuliani’s perspective because the desperate lawyer knew that with his prize client out of the White House he would lose his legal bulletproof vest.” “This time Donald Trump has no federal power no privileges no immunities to speak of” he added.
