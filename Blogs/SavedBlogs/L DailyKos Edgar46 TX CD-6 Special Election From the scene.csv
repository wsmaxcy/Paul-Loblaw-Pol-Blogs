L, TX CD-6 Special Election: From the scene, Edgar46, 2021-05-03, I voted Saturday May 1 in the special election held to advance in the race to fill the seat left vacant by the death of the not-to-be-missed Representative Ron Wright.  Seriously I don’t miss him at all.  It’s almost too bad they had to fill his seat.  He had been diagnosed with lung cancer won re-election signed on as one of the 126 GOP reps to the amicus curiae brief objecting to counting the votes voted against accepting the election results and then died of Covid-19 on February 7 two weeks after publicly announcing his diagnosis. The Republican candidates ranged the gamut from the wacky (watch Big Dan Rodimer ride a bull named “Pelosi”) through the credible (“Recruited by the Trump Administration” — Brian Harrison) all the way to the inevitable: Ten Democrats ran.  The main interests that you would expect divided their support among I voted for Ms. Lassiter whose energy enthusiasm background and leadership qualities are as one might say intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer.  Ms. Sanchez seems more like a budding career pol looking for that first electoral gig.  Ms. Bean has a thin biography although she did run and lose a race for the Texas House in 2020. GOPers Wright and Ellzey advanced to a runoff election date TBA.  I know whose eye I would prefer to poke.
