L, Indigenous New Zealand Lawmaker Censured For Haka Protest, Ed Scarce, 2021-05-14, The Māori party of New Zealand is a small but vocal group in New Zealand's parliament. Rawari Waititi is the male co-leader and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer the female co-leader. Source: The Guardian Māori party co-leader Rawiri Waititi has been thrown out of New Zealand’s parliament after denouncing rhetoric from the opposition as racist and performing a haka. Waititi said the opposition was inciting racism across New Zealand through its stance on Māori healthcare. The haka is a ceremonial dance for Māori the indigenous people of New Zealand – it can represent a challenge and is sometimes performed in moments of conflict....Waititi was ejected from the House by speaker Trevor Mallard after making a series of points of order. “Over the past two weeks there has been racist propaganda and rhetoric towards tangata whenua [indigenous people]. That not only is insulting to tangata whenua but diminishes the mana [dignity] of this House” Waititi said....When asked to sit down by Mallard he instead stepped into the centre of parliament to perform a haka and was subsequently thrown out. This was Waititi's second row with parliamentary rules this year. In February Waititi was ejected from the House for not wearing a tie. He said he had chosen to wear cultural dress in defiance of dress code: Waititi has dubbed ties a “colonial noose” and wore a pounamu or greenstone necklace in place of a necktie. House rules were subsequently revised to remove the necktie requirement.
