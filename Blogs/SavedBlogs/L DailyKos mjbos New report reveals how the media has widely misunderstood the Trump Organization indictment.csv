L, "New report reveals how the media has 'widely misunderstood' the Trump Organization indictment", mjbos, 2021-07-04, As it turns out not only have the two eldest spawn of the domestic terrorist that occupied the WH admitted guilt they specifically have admitted the 15 charges in the charging document including they kept double books. Those “fringe benefits” they claim were normal? The items noted are not “typical” according to Daniel Shavino in piece published in Just Security (justsecurity.org). Detailed explanation can be found in AlterNet article here: www.alternet.org/… It’s worth taking the time to read and then share with others. It’s clear most of the media have missed what is truly at stake and why the domestic terrorist who occupied the WH along with his three eldest spawn and Trump Organization executives are in deep trouble even if no other changes are filed which is unlikely. Enjoy reading I did!
