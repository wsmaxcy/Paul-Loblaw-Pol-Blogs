L, Group Auctioning Off Logo For Lauren Boebert's Gun-themed Restaurant , Ed Scarce, 2021-05-05, Lauren Boebert sued and failed to get a parody website shutdown. So now they're selling the logo to her gun-themed restaurant. The auction takes place on May 14. Source: Colorado Politics A group devoted to defeating U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert at the ballot box is auctioning off the logo used by Shooters Grill the Silt Republican's gun-themed restaurant in Rifle after a comedian said Boebert's congressional office demanded he take down a parody website filled with unflattering posts about the controversial lawmaker. Rural Colorado United a Pueblo-based independent expenditure group that has been campaigning against Boebert since last summer said it acquired the distinctive western-themed Shooters Grill logo after discovering earlier this year that Boebert had let the restaurant's state and federal trademarks lapse. "There are a lot of people out there more clever than us and we sure don't want to let this opportunity go to waste" the group tweeted Tuesday along with a link to the online auction. The logo is being sold as an NFT — short for "nonfungible token" unique data stored in a digital ledger known as a blockchain — with bidding open until noon May 14. The trademarked image is currently owned by an individual who has pledged to donate the proceeds to Rural Colorado United Bri Buentello a former Democratic state lawmaker and spokeswoman for the group told Colorado Politics.
