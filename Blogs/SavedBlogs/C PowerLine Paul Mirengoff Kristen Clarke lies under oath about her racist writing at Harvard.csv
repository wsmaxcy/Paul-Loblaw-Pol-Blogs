C, Kristen Clarke lies under oath about her racist writing at Harvard, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-04-15, During yesterday’s hearing on the nomination of Kristen Clarke to head the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division the nominee was asked about an article she wrote while a student at Harvard. In that article Clarke argued that Blacks are superior to Whites in numerous respects. We discussed Clarke’s racist claim  here. Clarke told Senators that the article was satire. But as  David Harsanyi points out there is no evidence to support this claim.  In fact all contemporary evidence is to the contrary. Around the same time she published her racist article Clarke invited a rabid anti-Semite Tony Martin to speak at Harvard.  The anti-Semite used the platform Clarke provided to  excoriate Jews. Clarke  praised him for his intelligence and the veracity of his work. Was her praise satirical? Harsanyi points out that the anti-Semite in question held some of the pseudo-scientific anti-White views Clarke peddled in her article — views that had currency among Black campus radicals at the time. If Clarke had presented these views as satire — to hold them up to ridicule — she would not have invited a blatant racist who promoted them to speak at Harvard and then praised him. Furthermore Clarke declined opportunities to say that her article was satire. Staffers at the Harvard Crimson in which Clarke published her piece denounced it and demanded a retraction. They noted correctly that there isn’t a hint of irony in her article. Clarke never responded that the article was an attempt at humor. Clearly it wasn’t.  At least Clarke was being honest back then. Yesterday she was dishonest — and  not just about her racist article.  Her unwillingness to tell the Senators the truth under oath is reason enough not to confirm her.
