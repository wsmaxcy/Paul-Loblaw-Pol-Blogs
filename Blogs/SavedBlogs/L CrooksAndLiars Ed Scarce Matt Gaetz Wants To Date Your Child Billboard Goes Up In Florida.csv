L, 'Matt Gaetz Wants To 'Date' Your Child' Billboard Goes Up In Florida, Ed Scarce, 2021-04-09, Probably the last thing you want to see when you're traveling State Road 85 informing you that your congressman is a sexual predator. Source: Northwest Florida News A billboard placed on heavily traveled State Road 85 near the Hub City center informs passers-by that "Matt Gaetz Wants to 'Date' Your Child." The sign paid for by an unabashedly anti-Trump political action committee known as Mad Dog PAC makes obvious reference to allegations that Rep. Gaetz a Fort Walton Beach resident traveled and had sex with a 17-year-old girl and that he paid for sex with other women. A website states Mad Dog PAC was founded in 2017 by former Bill Clinton White House staffer Clyde Taylor. Claude Taylor seems a tad unrepentant. Hello @mattgaetz any thoughts on the billboard?
