C, The man with the Biden laptop, Scott Johnson, 2021-01-20, I learn from Rowan Scarborough’s excellent Washington Times story that the man who turned over Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop to the FBI has a GoFundMe page to defray legal expenses and that he has posted tell-all videos with his story. The man’s name is John Paul Mac Isaac. If he were the protagonist in a political thriller he would be depicted as the average man whom circumstances serve up as a sacrificial hero. Although a brave newspaper credited his improbable story his victimization by the press at the behest of the powers that be would feature prominently. It would make for a compelling novel. Our hero trusted a government agency that betrayed him. Now he’s out in the cold. He opened the door to scandals that had to be killed with a presidential election imminent. He could not overcome the forces arrayed against him. In a realistic mode it would not have a happy ending. It would come to a bitter and disillusioned end. Scarborough’s account provides the raw material for the novel that is to be written. Isaac has posted a series of videos he calls The Truth. All are accessible here. Below is episode 5 of The Truth dated today.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
