L, Foiled Again! QAnon Conspiracy Dashed By Real Live Biden, Frances Langum, 03-18-21, Alas we live in a world where we have to "fact check" if Joe Biden is alive and walking towards reporters on the White House Lawn... ...or is it a lizard personor Trump in a maskor a deepfakeor a movie setor CGIor is the REAL Joe Biden dead since 1970?  All FALSE.   Since Biden was inaugurated QAnon supporters have pushed false claims of supposed proof that Biden hasn't really been president & his activities as president haven't been real. This may be the first time those claims have in some manner really spread elsewhere in the far-right. — Alex Kaplan (@AlKapDC) March 17 2021 A conspiracy theory TikTok account has gotten nearly 80000 views for this false conspiracy theory. pic.twitter.com/0HDLUpkB63 — Alex Kaplan (@AlKapDC) March 18 2021 On YouTube this false conspiracy theory has gotten tens of thousands of combined views. At least 2 of those videos have ads meaning YouTube has made money off of this false conspiracy theory. pic.twitter.com/kuM1ee8bTX — Alex Kaplan (@AlKapDC) March 18 2021 There appears to be a mental illness rampant in the United States that will not allow for a Democratic president to just exist.  And there are social media companies all too willing to make a buck off of this insanity.  So there are today in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty One FACT CHECKS when Joe Biden walks toward reporters with cameras outside the actual White House.  And those reporters have to tweet that yes he was there.  I was the one holding the lighter-colored fuzzy microphone and thus literally  in front of @POTUS on the South Lawn. It's all real. Who actually believes this 'faked moon landing' type nonsense and more importantly who is spreading it? https://t.co/9V3t0oqDz6 — Steve Herman (@W7VOA) March 17 2021 That large grey microphone is actually further to the right of Biden's hands not in front of them.There are multiple videos of the exchange taken from other angles as well as images. Obviously there's no green screen or CGI at play.And yes Biden is alive and real... pic.twitter.com/9pF3C9RF8d — Shayan Sardarizadeh (@Shayan86) March 17 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
