L, US health panel urges restarting J&J COVID-19 vaccinations, A Citizen, 2021-04-23, Star Tribune: US health panel urges restarting J&J COVID-19 vaccination  A U.S. health panel says it's time to resume use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine despite a very rare risk of blood clots. Out of nearly 8 million people vaccinated before the U.S. suspended J&J's shot health officials uncovered 15 cases of a highly unusual kind of blood clot three of them fatal. All were women most younger than 50. But advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday the vaccine's benefits outweigh that serious but small risk -- especially against a virus that's still infecting tens of thousands of Americans every day. The government will rapidly weigh that recommendation in deciding next steps.
