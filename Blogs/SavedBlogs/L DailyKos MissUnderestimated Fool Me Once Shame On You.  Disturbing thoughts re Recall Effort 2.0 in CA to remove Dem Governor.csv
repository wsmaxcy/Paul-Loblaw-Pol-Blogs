L, Fool Me Once Shame On You.  Disturbing thoughts re: Recall Effort 2.0 in CA to remove Dem Governor, MissUnderestimated, 2021-04-27, Californians will suffer as much as  a $400 million pilfering of the public coffers to fund a Republican Power-Grabbing recall election in 2022 that was enabled by a Trump Appointed Judge.   How did we get to this point especially considering the disastrous reign of Schwarzenegger who “won” in a recall effort against Gray Davis in 2003? According to an article in the Sacramento Bee March 15 2021 the Newsom recall led by former Yolo County law enforcement officer Orinn Heatlie was cleared by then Sec’y State Alex Padilla on June 10 2020. The petitioner had until Nov. 17 2020 (160 days) to gather 1.5 million signatures.   As of Oct. 2020 having collected only 675000 signatures  the petitioner filed a request with Sacramento Superior Court for an extension citing the pandemic as an impediment to signature gathering. Sec’y State Padilla was named as a respondent.   Padilla  argued against the extension saying the pandemic was not a good enough reason to extend the deadline — that the insufficient number was due to failed efforts of the petitioners. Judge James R. Arguelles a fresh Trump appointee took the recall petitioner’s side.** With all the dark money and antics who have the Republicans chosen as their candidate?  A person with no qualifications other than a huge presence in social media (similar to the last recall).    Let’s  NOT make this deja vu all over again!!!   So far corporate media seems to have NOT learned its lesson about handing exorbitant amounts of free coverage to a candidate simply due to celebrity status.  Let’s hope we don’t end up with a similar election result.  **Too bad Padilla never appealed the extension.  He was appointed U.S. Senator Dec. 22 2020 to fill Kamala Harris’s seat.
