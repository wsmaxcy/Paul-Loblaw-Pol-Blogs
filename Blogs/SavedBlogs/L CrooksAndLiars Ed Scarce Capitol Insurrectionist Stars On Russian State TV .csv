The YouTube of Russian TV interviewing Barnett is not viewable on other websites; you can watch it here. SURE there is no "collusion." But the white nationalist who put his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk is an American hero on Russian State TV.  "Barnett was introduced as a “colorful” individual—same expression Putin uses to describe Trump." That was deliberate too. Source: Daily Beast On Sunday Russian state TV aired an interview with insurrectionist Richard Barnett—notoriously pictured with his feet up on a desk in Nancy Pelosi’s office on Jan. 6—and his attorney Joseph McBride. Barnett a self-proclaimed white nationalist was introduced as a “colorful” individual the same expression Putin frequently uses to describe Trump. McBride welcomed Rossiya-1 special correspondent Valentin Bogdanov into his office and FaceTimed his client who appeared cheerful and at ease at his Arkansas ranch flashing a big smile and showing off his car collection. Bogdanov introduced Barnett who was arrested following the Capitol riot and subsequently released pending trial as “an American patriot” who protested against “the stolen election.” The network showcased clips from his exploits at the Capitol where he wielded a stun-gun stole mail from Pelosi’s office and left a threatening note for the House Speaker.

He was happy to talk to Russian state TV. Imagine what would have happened to any protester who broke into the Kremlin and propped his feet up on Putin's desk. pic.twitter.com/KqvuLdJXTm — Julia Davis (@JuliaDavisNews) June 13 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
