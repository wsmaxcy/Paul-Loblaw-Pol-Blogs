L, The guiding principles underlying fascism Trumpism and the religious and conservative right., Trenz Pruca, 2021-04-26, Let us not forget that there are at least ten guiding principles underlying fascism Trumpism and the religious and conservative right. They are: 1. “There are no facts only ideology.”(And when one scrapes away the pseudo-intellectual veneer what that ideology comes down to is “power” how to get it wield it and keep it.) 2. “There is no morality only religion.” 3. “There is no compassion only transaction.” 4. “There is no love only desire.” 5. “There is no peace only order.” 6. “There is no mercy only philanthropy.” 7 “There is no freedom only obedience.” 8. “There is no humanity only data assets consumers and laborers.” 9. “There is no truth only propaganda.” 10. “There are no principles only doctrines.”
