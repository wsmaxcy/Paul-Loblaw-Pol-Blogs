L, unhinged previous guy now tries to explain his anger at Bill Barr because circling the drain, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-06-27,  Jonathan Karl author of the Barr interview says this latest Trump screed “confirms Trump’s rage.” It begins the Trump revenge tour: Former President Donald Trump kicks off his revenge tour with his eyes on one Ohio Republican https://t.co/DHFvpOwGVB  You can figure out this trumpian Asimov Cascade of craziness because the squids are killing the decoys. And the strawberries pulled the ball bearings past the tow target. Actually this strange previous guy outburst may indicate that something might drop in terms of the NYC prosecution of the Trump Organization this week.    Last November @LeaderMcConnell pleaded with Barr to publicly shoot down Trump's claims of election fraud. “Look we need the president in Georgia” he told Barr “and so we cannot be frontally attacking him right now…You are really the only one who can do it.”   Losing failing and being unable to overturn failure are precursors to his worst nightmare - humiliation. It takes many forms. The hub for Trump is the exposure of his lifetime of secrets and lies. In his mind that impacts his following family legacy freedom ... everything.  Some will be tempted to respond - "it doesn't matter his followers are all too far gone." It's a mistake to lump them all together! The cult doesn't go away easily that's true. But it can shrink and it will. The discovery process during prosecution can and will influence this.  Fugitives will be hunted down: Police are currently trying to identify the mystery person who brought down almost the entire main peloton of riders after attempting to get themselves on camera with a large homemade sign that hit one of the leading cyclists setting off a disastrous chain reaction. The spectator disappeared as soon as the crash took place leading local gendarmes to begin a quest to track them down. A spokesperson for the local police force told L’Equipe that the incident was a ‘manifestly deliberate violation of an obligation of safety or prudence’. Organisers of Le Tour have threatened legal action to deter spectators from causing similar accidents in the future. ‘We are suing this woman who behaved so badly’ race deputy director Pierre-Yves Thouault said adding ‘We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this don’t spoil the show for everyone.’ www.unilad.co.uk/...
