L, PWB Peeps Open Thread: Open Doors, strawbaleforPWB Peeps, 2021-04-22,  Tagalong likes to use the automatic door opener.  He sits quietly by the door until a human notices him and opens it.  Then he might go out.  Or not. Manuel uses the voice-activated door opener.  He meows until a human opens the door.  Then he comes in.  Usually. Xena doesn’t believe in coming in.  She just meows for her meals served on the porch. If I leave the door open in nice weather while I go in and out to the garden Diana will cautiously creep out a little way and dart back in if anything startles her.  One day she got shut out for a while and was most annoyed! That same open door causes Thor to creep in with equal caution and dart back out as soon as he sees me move.  He will freak out if the door closes with him inside. But yesterday he found a catnip toy on one of his exploratory forays! PWBPeeps is a group that posts a daily diary and nightly open thread for animal lovers.
