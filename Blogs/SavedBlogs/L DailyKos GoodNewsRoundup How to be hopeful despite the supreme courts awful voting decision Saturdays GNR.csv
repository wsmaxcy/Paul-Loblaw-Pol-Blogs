L, How to be hopeful *despite* the supreme court's awful voting decision: Saturday's GNR, GoodNewsRoundup, 2021-07-03, If you are like me you were very upset (although not surprised) to see the Supreme Court decision on voting rights.  This group was handpicked to preserve the status quo and that is best preserved by keeping votes out of the hands of the disenfranchised. But despite my despair at the decision itself I remain hopeful.  First from Marc Elias: Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision on Brnovich v. DNC failed minority voters and the cause of democracy.   But if you think this means the fight for voting rights will stop you’re wrong — it's nowhere near over. Now is the time to step up our game and fight harder with every tool available to protect voters from suppressive laws.   While this decision upholds laws that disproportionately impact Arizona’s Native American Hispanic and African American citizens by unduly burdening their right to vote and limiting their access to the ballot box the Supreme Court did not take the drastic step of striking down Section 2 of the VRA. The ruling also has no impact on the vast majority of voting rights cases currently pending in the courts most of which bring challenges based on the constitutionality of the laws rather than the VRA. so that is good news.  And I also found this on Vox: Brnovich v. DNC is a bad opinion for voting rights. It’s also much better than could have been expected from a 6-3 conservative SCOTUS.  Around 10 am on Thursday many voting rights observers had a collective heart attack when they read the eight words that they had been most dreading: “JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.” And yet the opinion that followed Alito’s name is more measured than could have reasonably been expected from a Court where Republican appointees hold a 6-3 supermajority. It’s not by any means a good decision for democracy. Brnovich upholds both Arizona laws — a provision that disenfranchises voters for casting a ballot in the wrong precinct and another that prevents most third parties from delivering another voter’s absentee ballot to a polling place. But Alito’s opinion most likely preserves civil rights plaintiffs’ ability to challenge many of the most odious provisions of the voter suppression laws currently being pushed by Republican state lawmakers in other states. For starters the opinion is limited in scope. Brnovich does not apply to all Voting Rights Act cases or even to all cases involving the law’s “results test” — the specific provision of the Voting Rights Act at issue in the case. Rather the opinion limits its analysis to “cases involving neutral time place and manner rules” governing elections. Thus while Brnovich does shrink the Voting Rights Act considerably it primarily does so in this limited context. Second while Republican litigants proposed various interpretations of the Act that would have read a key prong of the Voting Rights Act so narrowly as to render it meaningless Alito’s opinion explicitly refuses to embrace those interpretations. “We decline in these cases to announce a test to govern all VRA §2 claims involving rules like those at issue here that specify the time place or manner for casting ballots” Alito writes. while Brnovich is a blow to liberal democracy it is not an apocalypse. Though two justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined an opinion suggesting that they would cut off all private suits enforcing the Voting Rights Act altogether — potentially neutralizing the law during Republican administrations — the other justices did not. The law survives albeit in a significantly weakened state. To be clear I am not claiming (and Vox is not claiming… and no reasonable person would be claiming) that voting rights are not under attack and that this is not a huge huge threat.  What I am saying is that we should heed this statement from Vox that this is not the apocalypse.  And we should listen to Elias when he says that we have a lot of fight left in us.  And we should remember that when we join together and fight like heck we tend to win. look at all Indivisible is doing (thanks CC for this info):  Across the country from 40 states plus Washington D.C. reports are rolling in of amazing events in our Deadline for Democracy campaign to get S.1 the For the People Act passed. Today we want to celebrate all your hard work and invite you to attend one or more of the 169+ events yet to come! Here’s some highlights: And that’s just a tiny sample! All across the country Indivisible and our allies have been showing up in droves. And we’re just getting started. What can we do?  Most important: DON'T LOSE HOPE.  This is a giant and important fight for us but win or lose we keep fighting and voting and organizing and spreading truth and light.  We never give up. I saw that Joni Mitchell’s album Blue turned 50 this year.  So I thought I’d share a song from that album and some other ones that also turned 50.  Turns out 1971 was a heck of a year for music! Voting rights activists on ‘Freedom Ride’ say their work will continue   It didn’t matter to LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright that Senate Republicans blocked debate on key voting rights legislation this week. Or that Democrats appear to be unwilling to end the filibuster to pass the election reform bill. The co-founders of Black Voters Matter continued their trek to Washington in a bus wrapped in the images and fueled by the spirit of the 1960s activists whose work they say is being threatened by a barrage of state laws restricting voting rights. Just as it took intense public pressure to force Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965 groups like Black Voters Matter have stepped up their efforts to push the federal government to again intervene to protect voting rights for people of color and young and low-income Americans. “Democracy is nonnegotiable for us” Brown said as she and Albright were in the midst of a week-long “Freedom Ride” through the South en route to the nation’s capital. “We’re still going to do everything in our power to push for this. One man or one session is not going to shut it down for us.” Progressive group launches $7 million effort to elect Democratic secretaries of state and attorneys general  A left-leaning group plans to spend $7 million to help elect Democratic secretaries of state and attorneys general in key battlegrounds -- a big investment in down-ballot races that loom large in voting rights battles around the country.  The remarkably unremarkable White House Pride ceremony  Standing at a lectern adorned with the presidential seal in the East Room of the White House a transgender activist announced his pronouns before introducing the president. President Biden started his remarks by wishing a belated happy birthday to the husband of Pete Buttigieg his transportation secretary. Later the commander in chief of the world’s most powerful military recognized a transgender lieutenant colonel who attended in full dress uniform saying to her “Thank you for your service to our nation.” Those acts were part of an event billed by the White House as a commemoration of LGBTQ+ Pride Month and each would have prompted headlines just a few years ago — and some just a few months ago. Yet on Friday none of it was particularly remarkable. Friday’s warm presidential embrace of the LGBTQ community was remarkable for not being all that remarkable because of how much and how quickly the country and the Democratic Party have changed. Public opinion among Democrats is overwhelmingly supportive of LGBTQ rights and Biden talks so frequently on the subject that it’s become routine another agenda item he ticks off in his public remarks. White House Unveils Strategy to Combat Domestic Extremism  The Biden administration on Tuesday unveiled a national strategy to combat domestic extremism calling for aggressive steps such as hiring more intelligence analysts and screening government employees for ties to hate groups. The 32-page plan highlights a shift in the government’s approach to counterterrorism which for decades has prioritized fighting foreign terrorists. But violent attacks by American extremists are growing a problem laid bare by the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6. “We cannot ignore this threat or wish it away” President Biden wrote in the strategy document. “Preventing domestic terrorism and reducing the factors that fuel it demand a multifaceted response across the federal government and beyond.” First rules to protect patients from unexpected medical bills issued by agencies  The Biden administration issued rules Thursday to shield Americans from large unexpected medical bills after patients wind up in emergency rooms or receive other care they did not realize lay outside their insurance networks. The rules to begin in January are the first in a series of coordinated steps that four federal agencies are required to take to set in motion a law Congress adopted last year to protect health-care consumers against a practice known as surprise billing. Biden unveils unprecedented government-wide strategy to encourage US citizenship  The Biden administration is introducing an unprecedented effort to encourage eligible immigrants to apply for US citizenship according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services official. Biden announces 5th wave of judicial nominees as Democrats aim to maintain quick pace of confirmations to federal bench President Joe Biden announced eight new federal judicial nominations on Wednesday as the White House seeks to maintain its rapid pace of nominations -- and confirmations -- to the federal bench. Biden Backs Removing Commanders from Military Sex Assault Cases President Biden endorsed a recommendation to remove the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault cases from the control of military commanders which officials had long resisted. Congress would have to act and a bill has the support of 70 senators. White House to raise federal firefighter pay to $15 an hour President Joe Biden is raising wages for federal firefighters to no less than $15 an hour as the White House seeks to put a spotlight on the growing threats of wildfires and heat waves exacerbated by climate change.  The US economy added 850000 jobs in June  The US economy added 850000 jobs in June when adjusted for seasonal changes. It was far more than economists had expected and a signal that American job growth is accelerating. One economic prediction I’m glad to have been wrong about Some economic predictions including some of my own turned out to be much too pessimistic as well. Among them: that the states were all about to go broke. Today many states are flush with cash with some even enjoying budget surpluses.  Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines Likely to Produce Lasting Immunity Study Finds Immune cells are still organizing to fight the coronavirus months after inoculation scientists reported. The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna set off a persistent immune reaction in the body that may protect against the coronavirus for years scientists reported on Monday. Why the Law Is Strong Enough to Take On Donald Trump  A 15-count indictment for tax fraud and other charges filed in New York on Thursday against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg has already stimulated as much hand-wringing as satisfaction from those who have called for accountability for Donald Trump. Some express concern that Mr. Trump himself was not charged and may never be. Others note that these are “only” state tax fraud counts against his business and an associate — rather than bold federal action against Mr. Trump himself by the Justice Department. As former federal and state prosecutors and government lawyers we believe that the charges support a different conclusion. Rather than betraying weakness they are a signal that our system of dual sovereignty in which multiple jurisdictions are empowered to address egregious wrongdoing can also address the difficulties that Mr. Trump has posed in his long-running battle with the rule of law. No-knock warrants officially banned in Lexington: Mayor signs new ordinance into law Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton has signed into law an ordinance which bans no-knock warrants in Fayette County she told the Herald-Leader Friday morning. The Catholic bishops’ anti-Biden project is backfiring   Whatever the bishops decide in the coming months Biden is unlikely to be denied communion as the USCCB’s subsequent statement effectively conceded — at least when he’s close to home. The Vatican may step in and the leaders of the dioceses where Biden typically attends Mass including Gregory have to their credit allowed the faithfully churchgoing president to receive.  Having pulled back ever so slightly the bishops should now drop this ill-conceived project altogether. It will only continue to undercut their capacity — already strained by scandal — to preach teach and persuade. They might take a moment to ponder the call to dialogue from Thomas Merton the Trappist monk and brilliant writer whom Pope Francis lifted up in his 2015 speech to Congress.  Lawyers find parents of 23 more migrant children separated under Trump  Pro bono lawyers tasked by a federal judge with identifying immigrant families separated by the Trump administration have successfully contacted the parents of 23 more children in the past six weeks according to a report filed in court Wednesday. That brings the number of known separated children whose parents have not yet been located down to 368.  Attorney General Merrick Garland suspends federal executions Thirteen people on federal death row were executed between July 2020 and January 2021 after then-Attorney General William Barr federal prison officials to carry them out.  In a memo to senior officials he said serious concerns have arisen about the arbitrariness of capital punishment its disparate impact on people of color and "the troubling number of exonerations" in death penalty cases. "The Department of Justice must ensure that everyone in the federal criminal justice system is not only afforded the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States but is also treated fairly and humanly" he said.                    That is it for today. I am so lucky and so proud to be in this with you ✊🏾✊🏻♥💙💚💛💜🧡✊🏽✊🏻
