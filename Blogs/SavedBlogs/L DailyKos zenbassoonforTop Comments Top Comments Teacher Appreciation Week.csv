L, Top Comments: Teacher Appreciation Week?, zenbassoonforTop Comments, 2021-05-09, So it’s Teacher Appreciation Week this week.  Of course it’s also Nurses Appreciation Week as well. Can you tell where this is going?  This is the week where we “appreciate” teachers for doing what we do. This week at my school we had lunch supplied by our PTSA. Monday was spaghetti Tuesday was fried chicken and yesterday was a taco truck for us. If you go to any teacher group on Facebook there are lots of stories about how administration “appreciates” teachers. Usually with superficial gestures and the occasional free meal but nothing worthwhile. Because why give extra benefits or pay raises or other such tangible means of expressing appreciation when you can give them a free meal or “flood their inboxes with good messages”? And think of this—as I mentioned it’s also Nurses Appreciation Week as well. Nurses Week culminates on May 12 Florence Nightingale’s Birthday. Teacher Appreciation Week is the first full week of May. Is it a coincidence that so often those two celebrations overlap? That’s an argument for another diary. For now join me over the fold for something CONCRETE that is being negotiated in my district for this year at least.   Here at Top Comments we welcome longtime as well as brand new Daily Kos readers to join us at 10pm Eastern. We strive to nourish community by rounding up some of the site's best funniest most mojo'd & most informative commentary and we depend on your help!! If you see a comment by another Kossack that deserves wider recognition please send it either to topcomments at gmail or to the Top Comments group mailbox by 9:30pm Eastern. Please please please include a few words about why you sent it in as well as your user name (even if you think we know it already :-)) so we can credit you with the find! I found out this week that my union and the district administration are in negotiations for a “COVID Stipend” to reward teachers for their efforts in 2020 and 2021 in dealing with all the stuff we’ve had to deal with. We’ve had to completely reinvent teaching to make virtual learning meaningful and growth oriented. Even now as we have kids back in the building the majority (about 73%) of students are still virtual so we have to teach to kids both in the room and on Google Meet at the same time. So we’re still having to reinvent teaching as we go. AND keep our kids still learning. As Diane Ravitch says “WHAT ‘learning loss?’” As one commenter on that article says The people who are saying there is a “learning loss” are the same ones who have said that schools need to “reopen.” Schools have been open this whole time. They were “open” last spring when the pandemic started and they are “open” now. Teachers are teaching and have been this whole time. And yet schools are doing things to combat this “learning loss”. There is standardized testing this year a flat out broken promise that President Biden LIED to us about. My kids are so DONE with this school year and to be honest so am I. Kids that I have spend years building relationships with are just SO disconnected from everything. Kids weren’t “homeschooled” this past year they had TEACHERS teaching them. All those parents whining about on line learning are learning EXACTLY how little they actually parent their kids. We are NOT parents to these kids. During these times it’s the PARENTS who are responsible for making sure their kids are on the Meet and are doing their assignments. And these parents are finding out how they have failed their children and are trying to blame it on teachers.  But I need to stop ranting now before I go WAY too far.  I am glad that my district is even thinking about rewarding us with a tangible acknowledgement of what we’ve been put through this past year or so. And I hope the union is able to give us a nice four figure check soon. Because even though I make close to my age (54) I still live paycheck to paycheck. But that’s also another diary.  So on to Tops! Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down.
