What planet is Louie Gohmert living on right now? pic.twitter.com/ia6exT4Sg7 â€” Frances Langum ðŸ§¶ (@bluegal) June 9 2021 During a Zoom hearing on Climate Change the so-called Congressman from Texas asked a witness if BLM by which we assume he meant the Bureau of Land Management but hey BLM can be taken other ways and far be it from me to assume what Louie Gohmert thinks Black Lives Matter is doing with the planetary orbits.  Gohmert asked Ms. Jennifer Eberlien Associate Deputy Chief of the National Forest System the following: "I understand from whatâ€™s been testified to the Forest Service and the BLM you want very much to work on the issue of climate change" Gohmert says.  "I was informed by the immediate past director of NASA that they found that the moonâ€™s orbit is changing slightly and so is the Earthâ€™s orbit around the sun. We know thereâ€™s been significant solar flare activities and so is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to change the course of the moonâ€™s orbit or the Earthâ€™s orbit around the sun? Obviously that would have profound effects on our climate." "YA THINK?" the very composed yet smiling Ms. Eberllen did not reply.  She should get an award for composure. "I would have to follow up with you on that one Mr. Gohmert."  she said.   I wouldn't bother.  He'll be off-planet by the time you call.   Taxing and regulating the fossil fuel industry just seems so unfair and hard. Can't we just you know goose the Earth's orbit a bit? â€” Peter Huestis (@RealSparklePony) June 9 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
