L, Remember The Insurrectionist In Nancy Pelosi's Office?  He Says "Biatch" Is A Term Of Endearment., Merlin196357, 2021-04-27, Old white misogynistic insurrectionist Richard Barnett of Arkansas has a million and one excuses for why he should be released from jail and the latest is that he didn’t call Speaker Nancy Pelosi a “bitch” in the note he left on her desk.  Oh no.  Barnett is now arguing that he spelled out “biatch” which according to his lawyers is a “term of endearment.”    His lawyer even provided a link to an online urban dictionary of “biatch.”  Therefore why is Barnett still sitting in jail? I don’t know.  Maybe it was the image of Barnett with his feet up on Nancy Pelosi’s desk for one?  Having feet on desks is a clear sign of disrespect.  Also HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN HER OFFICE IN THE FIRST DAMN PLACE!  Unless Pelosi invited him in it is against the law for Barnett to be wandering around the Capitol Building. Oh right.  Barnett claimed he was “looking for a bathroom” when he found Speaker Pelosi’s office open.  So he was going to take a piss in there?  That’s real respect for you. Then there is Barnett outside telling everyone that will listen how badly he “suffered” during the insurrection.  And if you listen near the end he distinctly calls Nancy Pelosi a “bitch.”   That’s Richard “Bigo” Barnett 60 from Gravette Ak. showing off the personalized envelope he took from Speaker Pelosi’s office. He insisted he didn’t steal it — “I left a quarter on her desk.” pic.twitter.com/aST7MCoRwP So this fucking idiot expects a judge to believe that he didn’t write the word “bitch” in the note he left for Pelosi.  Smacks head!  Oh I forgot!   Republicans do not believe in video as proof of anything!   And given Barnett has shown what an asshole he is with his court hijinks of sceaming at the judge during court appearances I can’t for the life of me think why any judge would doubt Barnett’s words. But there was a report on MSNBC that our sterling insurrectionist may be cracking under the strain of jail.  I can’t find a link now but it was reported that Barnett wants to cut a deal with the Feds.  I’m not sure he has anything to offer because of his continual lying about Jan 6th.  Also reported was Barnett’s claim that the stun gun he brought to zap Pelosi didn’t work.  He made this statement at the same time he lied about what he called Pelosi in his note. Keep his ass in jail.
