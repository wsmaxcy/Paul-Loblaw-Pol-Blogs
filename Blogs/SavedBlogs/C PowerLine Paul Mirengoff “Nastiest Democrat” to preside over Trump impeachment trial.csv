C, “Nastiest Democrat” to preside over Trump impeachment trial, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-01-25, As expected Chief Justice Roberts has  declined to preside at the Senate trial of President Trump. Roberts is not required to preside because Trump is not the president. Clearly he wants no part of the proceeding.  You might think that in Roberts’ absence Kamala Harris would preside. After all as vice president of the U.S. she is president of the Senate. However the “honor” will go instead to Sen. Patrick Leahy the president pro tempore of the Senate. Leahy is 80 years old. Without Roberts the trial will lack the solemnity and dignity his presence would have provided. With a Democrat in charge the proceeding will look like what it is — a vindictive partisan exercise (in futility to boot).  The Democrats may believe that Leahy will be a dignified presence. If so they are buying their own BS. Leahy might be more dignified than Kamala Harris but that’s a very low bar.  When Leahy ran the Senate Judiciary Committee I watched him run more hearings than I care to remember. He was always a nasty partisan operator — indeed Jay Nordlinger of National Review named Leahy  “the nastiest Democrat.”  Leahy couldn’t help being that way then and I doubt he can help it now at the advanced age of 80. He’s the perfect face for this trial.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
