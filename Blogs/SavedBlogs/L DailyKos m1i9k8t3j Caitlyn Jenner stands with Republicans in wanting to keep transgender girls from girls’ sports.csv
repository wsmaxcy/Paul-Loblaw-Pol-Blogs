L, Caitlyn Jenner stands with Republicans in wanting to keep transgender girls from girls’ sports, m1i9k8t3j, 2021-05-03, If evidence was needed that Caitlyn Jenner is no different from any other hateful bigoted Republican:  CNN: Jenner opposes transgender girls participating in girls' sports When a reporter asked Jenner during the impromptu interview for her opinion on the efforts by some Republican legislatures to ban transgender athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identities she replied that she does not support trans girls playing on girls' teams. "This is a question of fairness. That's why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls' sports in school" said Jenner a Republican who is one of the most high-profile transgender Americans in public life. "It just isn't fair. And we have to protect girls' sports in our schools." The main problem is that we do not know where Caitlyn Jenner’s “fairness” argument ends.  It smacks of hypocrisy:  it’s okay for her to be transgender but nobody else can enjoy any benefits.  It sounds like every other minority that still decides to remain in the Republican party.  This is the same jerk that used an assassination attempt of Republican members of the House of Representatives to make fun of liberals.  This is the same jerk that supported the compulsive liar and provocateur that is the previous executive officer all the way.  Now she wants to be governor of California in this partisan game Republicans want to play that is the upcoming recall.  Jenner you will NEVER get my vote.
