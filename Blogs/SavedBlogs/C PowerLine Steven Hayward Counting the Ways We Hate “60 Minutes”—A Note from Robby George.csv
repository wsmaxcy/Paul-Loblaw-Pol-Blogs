C, Counting the Ways We Hate “60 Minutes”—A Note from Robby George, Steven Hayward, 2021-05-01, Needless to say Power Line has a history with “60 Minutes.” Hence I thought it worth passing along a note from Robert P. George to “60 Minutes” this week. Prof. George—”Robby” to his friends—is the McCormick Professor at Princeton the chair originally created for Woodrow Wilson and subsequently filled by Edward Corwin and now by Robby. He is renowned for his genial nature (as you might expect from a proficient banjo player) and good relations with people on the left with whom he disagrees. He team-teaches a very popular course with the far-left Cornel West. Thus for Robby to send this note to “60 Minutes” is remarkable: Earlier this week I received an email message from a Producer at 60 Minutes requesting an interview for a segment they are working on concerning scientific developments in the area of embryo research. Here is my reply: Robert George Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
