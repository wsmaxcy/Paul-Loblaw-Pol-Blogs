L, Republicans Who Backed Trump‚Äôs Election Lies Called Out For False Patriotism On July 4, Lee Moran, 2021-07-05, Patriotic Fourth of July tweets from Republicans in Congress rang hollow for many people on Sunday. Critics called out lawmakers who celebrated Independence Day and freedom but conveniently forgot to mention they had promoted Donald Trump‚Äôs 2020 election lies that fueled the deadly U.S. Capitol riot earlier this year as well as their subsequent votes against a bipartisan investigation into the violence. See how officials ‚Äî including Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) ‚Äî and the Republican National Committee marked the holiday: Happy birthday today to the United States of America! Don‚Äôt listen to the haters - this is the greatest nation in the history of the world and our future is going to be incredible üá∫üá∏ #FourthofJuly #IndependenceDay I‚Äôm proud to be an American and I‚Äôm proud to be free.That‚Äôs why I will continue to fight each and every day to protect our God-given liberties.#HappyIndependenceDay pic.twitter.com/r29dpiQVpJ Happy Independence Day! Let freedom ring. pic.twitter.com/Dy9p0Vtsfa Happy 245th Birthday to America! pic.twitter.com/AeUSMRx0TA Happy birthday America! üá∫üá∏After the year we've all had this Independence Day should hold special meaning.  Despite the ill-fated efforts of the elites‚Äîwe are FREE. We can never take our freedom for granted. We have to treasure it‚Äîand defend it‚Äîeach and every day. pic.twitter.com/xl4uaIjgKN Today we celebrate our great nation and our freedom. Thank you to those who have fought and are fighting to make sure the United States remains the land of the free and home of the brave. I hope you and your family have a safe and Happy Independence Day! pic.twitter.com/IW8EfQv79w After the battle of Yorktown during the Revolutionary War French officer Marquis de Lafayette said ‚ÄúHumanity has won its battle liberty now has a country.‚Äù As we celebrate our freedom today remember those who sacrificed for our great nation.

Wishes you a happy #FourthofJuly. https://t.co/bsSI1Oph5X Happier this year than the last four. You are full of shit @SenTedCruz.  You will not defend rights of Americans to life like my daughter & to be free from gun violence. Americans know you will not defend our Democracy from an attack leaving many to wonder were those your friends? Texans know you will just leave. https://t.co/1okrmjfT0A #GOPEnemiesOfTheState So why you trying so hard to bring back a king/autocrat back...    Freedom for who?? In what world is the minority leader of the House of Representatives not an "elite"? Kevin McCarthy man of the people? I think not. Which your party conspired to end on Jan 6. Let‚Äôs try not to attack it today ok. Hypocrisy at it finest.
