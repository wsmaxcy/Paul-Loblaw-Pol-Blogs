L, Robotic Republican Tries To Stop Ohio's Vaccine Lottery, Frances Langum, 2021-05-25, As Tengrain at Mock Paper Scissors points out this Republican lawmaker "wins the Rubio Award For Excellence In Mindlessly Repeating A Talking Point." Rep. Jena Powell guess which party is introducing legislation to stop the wildly popular Ohio Vaccine Lottery because she claims it's a "waste of taxpayer money."   CNN's New Day host Brianna Keillar pointed out to her that the lottery costs 9 cents per Ohioan and may gain herd immunity for the state.   It's cheaper than ventilators death and economic shutdowns...JENA.   Ohio already has a regular lottery that has provided $26 billion to Ohio K-12 schools since its inception in 1974.  Newsweek reports that "The $5 million in prize money will come from federal COVID-19 relief funds that the state has already received."   Really Jena.  This is a poor excuse for getting on the national news.  Buh bye.  Ohio state Rep. Jena Powell says the state’s vaccine lottery program is “a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.”“It feels like a bribe to Ohioans ... [They] don’t want gimmicky programs.”https://t.co/5LJ7IlWpmh pic.twitter.com/VdX3w9JEqD — New Day (@NewDay) May 24 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
