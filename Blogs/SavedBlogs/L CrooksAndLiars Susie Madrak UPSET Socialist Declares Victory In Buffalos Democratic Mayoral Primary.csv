L, UPSET: Socialist Declares Victory In Buffalo's Democratic Mayoral Primary, Susie Madrak, 2021-06-23, We need your help now more than ever.

It's not official yet but it looks like a primary challenger endorsed by the Working Families Party and Democratic Socialists of America beat a four-term Democratic incumbent to become the Democratic nominee and likely next mayor of New York's second-largest city. Via the New York Times: A progressive challenger running her first campaign was poised on Tuesday to beat Buffalo’s four-term Democratic mayor in a primary upset that would upend the political landscape in New York’s second-biggest city and signal the strength of the party’s left wing. The challenger India B. Walton is a former nurse and community activist who ran with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party. She was leading Byron Brown a longtime member of the Democratic establishment by 7 percentage points or about 1500 votes as of midnight with all of the in-person ballots counted according to unofficial results. Should Ms. Walton 38 win the primary and then triumph in the general election November — a likely result in heavily Democratic Buffalo — she would be the first socialist mayor of a major American city since 1960 when Frank P. Zeidler stepped down as Milwaukee’s mayor. She would also be the first female mayor in Buffalo’s history. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
