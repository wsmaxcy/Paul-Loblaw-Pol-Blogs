L, 18th Century Japanese prints, OjibwaforStreet Prophets, 2021-07-06, Welcome to the Street Prophets Coffee Hour cleverly hidden at the intersection of religion and politics. This is an open thread where we can share our thoughts and comments about the day. I thought we might start today by looking at some 18th century Japanese prints. One of the most celebrated artists in the history of the Japanese print is Suzuki Harunobu (1725?-1770). The Portland Art Museum had display of his work. According to the museum display: “A painter and print designer his subject matter was the urban entertainments of the city of Edo or what was known in his day as ukiyo-e “pictures of the floating world.” Harunobu’s depictions of youthful beauties—women and men—often conveyed amusing subtexts but it was the vivid color of his prints that drove his rapid ascent to prominence at a critical moment in Japanese printmaking.”  Harunobu dominated the world of Japanese printmaking from 1765 until his death in 1770 and during this time he is estimated to have produced as many as 800 distinct print designs. According to the display: “The stylish scenes of everyday life young lovers and famous beauties portrayed in Harunobu’s prints illustrate the latest fashions of the day. The new technology of full-color printing made it possible for the first time to depict elaborately dyed and woven textile patterns. Even seemingly simply kimono might be embellished with blind-embossing a printing effect that gives a rich three-dimensional texture. Period viewers would have been intimately familiar with the fashions depicted in ukiyo-e and been able to decipher in clothing and hairstyles social codes about their wearers.”                            This is an open thread—all topics are welcome.
