L, a new Fed chair... maybe but probably not., annieliforDirt farming in the South by South West Wing of the White House, 2021-05-11, The usual handicapping for a new Fed Chair is happening but likely it’s too early. Lael Brainard and William Spriggs would be front-runners. Jay Powell's term is up next February when Biden can choose to extend his appointment. We’ll know so much more then what with a looming recession. Biden would be nuts not to reappoint Powell. His critics don't realize the huge shift in policy Powell has brought about at the Fed. A chair explicitly committed to full employment and with a wait and see attitude on inflation is worlds away from where we were 2 decades ago  But the Fed chief who joined the central bank's board of governors in 2012 after being nominated by then-President Barack Obama isn’t without progressive support. He achieved consensus at the central bank for a new framework in which the Fed has vowed to vigorously pursue full employment rather than prematurely slow economic activity with higher interest rates in anticipation of inflation a move that could spread greater prosperity to marginalized communities. That has earned him some prominent allies. “My hope would be that he would be reappointed” said William Spriggs a professor at Howard University and chief economist at the AFL-CIO a significant statement of support since Spriggs himself is often touted on the left as a potential pick to head the central bank. “I don’t think people should take lightly” how significant the Fed’s pro-worker shift has been under Powell said Spriggs adding that “we need a little stability at the Fed after having gone through four years of Trump.” The message from groups like the Action Center for Race and the Economy though is that the Fed chair’s actions have not been nearly enough. They point to the central bank’s emergency program for states and cities last year which ultimately gave out loans to only two borrowers — Illinois and New York City’s transit system. They argue that’s because the Fed didn’t make the terms as generous as a separate program for corporate borrowers. The group also cites Powell’s resistance to taking more responsibility for combating the wealth disparity between white people and other racial groups. Just last week he reiterated that he didn’t think it made sense for Congress to make that part of the Fed’s official mandate. www.politico.com/... "The Fed’s policies have helped generate jobs and reduce unemployment which was their goal. In the process however the Fed has accelerated the decades-long increase in economic inequality...".#wealthinequality #lawtwitter #AcademicTwitter https://t.co/XRY69BDxQj  I’ve pushed Chair Powell to focus on the unequal recovery for Black and Brown families and I appreciate his work. Congress should pass my bill with @RepMaxineWaters to make every Fed Chair report on these disparities and act to address systemic racism. https://t.co/bE4RdsYqMw  Fed Chair Jerome Powell says he wants to see a broad recovery that lifts all demographics. Here are the numbers he’s watching to judge that progress and how they fared in April's jobs report. https://t.co/0pFc17Zbgg via @bbgequality  I would side with the former Fed chair — one of the most respected economists in the country who has tons of data to back her up — over the party that falsely promised tax cuts would pay for themselves and permanently increase growth and jobs.https://t.co/OlaN2lXR4L “...  "Why exactly is the Fed still increasing its holdings of mortgage-backed securities by $40 billion a month when Chair Jerome Powell himself has said that `the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn'?"--@BChappatta @bopinion https://t.co/3VWoyskXLu  While Fed Chair Powell views supply-chain challenges as temporary companies say constraints will linger maybe into 2022. Wait times of factories for production materials grew to 79 days in April longest on record. https://t.co/yftkmf655Y via @DoubleTGolle @readep @economics pic.twitter.com/nflWhS3L4V  Biden claimed the last 5 leaders of the Fed spoke out to say his jobs plan will grow the economy.False. Only 3 past Fed chiefs are even alive. Biden was wrongly describing an op-ed from 5 former IRS chiefs who praised his plan but didn’t discuss growth: https://t.co/gqxRu6Crj1 Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden claimed last Wednesday that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had declared that his American Jobs Plan proposal will increase economic growth.
