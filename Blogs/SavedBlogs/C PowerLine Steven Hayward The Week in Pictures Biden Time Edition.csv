C, The Week in Pictures: Biden Time Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-26, After this week’s willow-the-whispering Joe Biden I’m moving up my sports book wager on how soon he’s going to be removed from office. It is hard to know right now which is the bigger farce: Joe the Whisperer or Kamala the Kackler? There isn’t an infrastructure bill big enough to prop up these two.                                           Headlines of the week starting with how much the New York Times must hate its readers to do this:                 These two columns both by Jen Rubin:                      And finally. . .  a slight change to format this week: Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
