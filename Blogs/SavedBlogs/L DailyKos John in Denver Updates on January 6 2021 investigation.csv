L, Updates on January 6 2021 investigation, John in Denver, 2021-04-23, There’s been a couple of news stories about progress with the DoJ investigation that I’ve not seen mentioned on DKos.  Still described as “one of the largest” investigations ever undertaken by the FBI the efforts are leaving me shaking my head — OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. The Department of Justice said last week that more than 410 defendants have been arrested since the attack and the government wrote in a Thursday court filing that in addition to the 400 people who have already been charged the government expects to charge at least 100 more…. [Last month FBI Director] Wray said "With [citzen’s] help we've identified hundreds of suspects and opened hundreds of investigations in all but one of our 56 field offices." The government said it has issued a combined total of over 900 search warrants and the investigation has included more than 15000 hours of surveillance and body-worn camera footage from multiple law enforcement agencies. The government has also gathered approximately 1600 electronic devices the results of hundreds of searches of electronic communication providers over 80000 reports and 93000 attachments related to law enforcement interviews and other investigative steps authorities said in a filing. The DoJ website on January 6 has 376 cases on its list which means there are at least 35 that remained sealed.  The article also has some details on the demographics of those arrested the charges brought and that “At least 158 people have been approved to go home after posting bail or agreeing to supervised release.”  Which means many have not.  The posts raise new questions about whether the FBI missed or failed to act on these threats and why federal prosecutors have so far said in court they have not determined whether anyone planned the attack in advance. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and the FBI did not respond to an NBC News request…. ...the FBI not the Capitol Police is ultimately responsible for detecting and thwarting terrorism attacks and FBI officials have continued to insist there was no intelligence failure. An investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General is ongoing. The story continued including a question by Rep. Adam Schiff to FBI Director Wray: what is the bureau's policy in terms of your ability to review social media when it's appropriate to do it when it's not appropriate to do it? Do you have a clear policy on that and are there legal constraints as well that preclude you from getting the intelligence that you need?" In his response Wray said that absent a tip or some other impetus the bureau was not free to hunt for threats of violence or domestic terror plots social media even if the posts are public. "We do not as the FBI simply patrol social media looking for problems" he said. So what sorts of things CAN be done by the FBI on social media?  I was amused as I read about the arrest of one insurrectionist. Because of facial recognition software and his girlfriend's Instagram photos he's now in custody — the 14th Kentuckian arrested for participation in the U.S. Capitol riots…. ...clearer photos and more videos of the same man were posted on Twitter by Sedition Hunters a group committed to "hunting and distributing clear face images" of rioters. Using the new photos and facial recognition software the FBI was able to identify Randolph through photos on his girlfriend's Instagram account according to the complaint. On March 3 after the FBI followed Randolph to work they took photos of him wearing the same gray Carhartt hat jacket and jeans seen in videos of the riots. On April 13 the FBI agents working undercover recorded a conversation they had with him at his "workplace" which appears to be a store. Randolph was apparently arrested on April 14.  As a reminder the FBI is still asking for assistance identifying people shown in photos and videos at U.S. Capitol Violence: MOST WANTED
