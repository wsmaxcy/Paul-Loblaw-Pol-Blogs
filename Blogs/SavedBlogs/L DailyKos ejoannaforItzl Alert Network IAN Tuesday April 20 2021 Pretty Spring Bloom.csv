L, IAN: Tuesday April 20 2021: Pretty Spring Bloom, ejoannaforItzl Alert Network, 2021-04-19,  Tuesday:  A day to: enjoy Spring bloom.       Monday: Crimson Quillfeather Tuesday: ejoanna Wednesday: Pam from Calif Thursday: art ah zen Friday: FloridaSNMOM Saturday: FloridaSNDad Sunday: loggersbrat Spring isn’t my favorite season; fall is.  But I’ll admit it: Spring brings its own kind of fresh beauty.  (I just wish it would bring us some rain too!) So here’s a sample.  Some of these are hard to get to bloom here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Some never will bloom here because our winters are too mild.  Some like tulips will bloom the first year but seldom again. And have to be coaxed the first try with several weeks in one’s refrigerator before putting the bulbs in the ground. On the other hand daffodils are great repeat performers hereabouts.  And deer resistant. Hyacinths will bloom but I haven’t yet gotten them to repeat. Camellias are a winter staple here.  Very successful!  And grow to tall garden shrubs.  As do azaleas at least most varieties.  Garden staples for me for decades. Hellebores seem to be spring bloomers in many other parts of the country.  Here they bloom around Xmas—and in fact are still in bloom for me. (They are also known as Christmas Rose.)  One CA native never fails to pop up here in early spring along roadsides marginal areas dry hillsides--sometimes in your garden if you sow the seeds.  Hard to transplant though—best to use seeds. Bloom last a few weeks and then poof!  Gone until next spring.   And what spring bloom thrives in your neck of the woods?
