C, Mob Rule In Minnesota, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-19, The murder trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin is wrapping up today with closing arguments and jury instructions. The National Guard is standing by to deal with the expected riots when the jury returns its verdict later this week along with law enforcement from several local agencies as well as other states. Downtown Minneapolis resembles a fortress only with fewer people. Both Scott and I have questioned whether Chauvin can possibly get a fair trial in the current atmosphere. Jurors cannot fail to understand the consequences of a “not guilty” verdict. It has been reported that Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman sold his Minneapolis home at a loss and moved out of the city after “protesters” besieged his house and his office received “millions of e-mails and thousands of phone calls” about the George Floyd case. I have it on good authority that he is not the only public official who has sold his house and moved out of Minneapolis for reasons of personal safety. Eric Nelson has been the sole in-court lawyer defending Chauvin for the last three weeks. When America’s biggest and best law firms lined up to represent Islamic terrorists at Guantanamo Bay for free they were applauded with the pious reflection that everyone deserves a legal defense. That principle does not apply however to police officers. I cannot imagine the abuse to which Mr. Nelson has been subjected over the past weeks or the legitimate fear for his own safety that he must feel. It happens that there is another Minneapolis lawyer named Eric Nelson. (That name is no doubt more common in Minnesota than most places.) This Eric Nelson is a family lawyer who has nothing at all to do with the Floyd case yet he has been bombarded with angry and threatening messages from leftists. While the “real” Eric Nelson was delivering his closing argument the second Eric Nelson received these emails: From: john sparo

24 seconds “Yeah this is Eric Nelson the one that’s on TV right now during the trial. Trying to get this call off that murder the guy piece of […]. You piece of […]. […]. Don’t let me run across you.” One can only imagine the volume of threats and abuse that the “right” Eric Nelson has received and will continue to receive especially if the jury fails to do the mob’s bidding. While I have been critical of some aspects of his handling of Chauvin’s defense I take my hat off to him for his courage.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
