L, No Biden isn't going to nuke insurrectionists., RobertEnders, 2021-06-27, So the latest right wing trope is that Biden has threatened to use nuclear weapons and F-15’s against those who would overthrow the government. Friends if you see people saying this in the wild go ahead and show them this article because I want to talk to them.Here is what Biden actually said:  Watch that as many times as you need to. Biden did NOT say he was going to nuke any of you. He said that if YOU are going to fight a war against the government YOU will need some very heavy firepower. You will need big weapons too heavy for the bed of your truck and too big to fit in your garage. All an AR-15 will do to an Abrams tank is scratch the paint.My own beliefs on guns are nuanced: I think most people should be allowed to have guns. I think some people who are prone to violence and self-harm should not be allowed to own guns. I understand that telling the difference between who should and who should not be allowed to bear arms creates a challenge. I think red flag laws are a step in the right direction. But saying “We need guns in case we need to overthrow the government” is not the compelling argument that you think it is. You can say that you need guns for self-defense against street criminals hunting or making Internet videos where you put holes in cans. You can just say that you just really really like guns and you promise not to use your precious guns on any people because you don’t want your babies to end up in an evidence locker for the next 75 years. Try saying things that make the rest of us feel safer.“But Robert if we can’t possibly overthrow the government with AR-15’s how did we come so close on January 6th?” First of all if you actually said that out loud you need to shut up and get a lawyer. Secondly the reason why you came so close is because you had President Trump’s help. He knew most of you would have nothing more than pepper spray zipties and whatever you picked up inside the Capitol. He helped keep the National Guard out of your way.  You won’t have President Biden’s help when you try that crap again.
