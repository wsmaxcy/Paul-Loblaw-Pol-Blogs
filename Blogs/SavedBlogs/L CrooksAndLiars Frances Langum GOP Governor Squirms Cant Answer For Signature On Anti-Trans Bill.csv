L, GOP Governor Squirms: Can't Answer For Signature On Anti-Trans Bill, Frances Langum, 2021-04-30, This week Republican Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia signed into law House Bill 3293 which the Human Rights Campaign calls "an anti-transgender bill that would ban transgender girls and women from participating in sports at the elementary secondary or post-secondary level consistent with their gender identity." Stephanie Ruhle asked the governor a simple question:   "Can you give me one example of a transgender child trying to get an unfair advantage? Just one in your state you signed a bill about it." Jim Justice: "No I can't really tell you one." These stupid discriminatory laws being passed or at least considered in 30 states is just culture war BS for the Republican Party.  It has nothing to do with sports.   I wish more journalists would do what Stephanie Ruhle David Crary of AP and others have done: ask Republican lawmakers directly what evidence they have to support their anti-trans policies + views. The available data on this clearly supports trans rights. Hold them accountable. ‚Äî Charlotte Clymer üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (@cmclymer) April 30 2021 This morning @MSNBC‚Äôs Stephanie Ruhle destroyed GQP bigoted Gov Jim Justice over the anti-Trans bill banning Trans children from sports and she did it by mentioning West Virginia ranks among the worst in Economy Education Healthcare and Infrastructure. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done. ‚Äî Ricky Davila (@TheRickyDavila) April 30 2021 Stephanie Ruhle just called out GOP WV Gov. Jim Justice for him signing a bill banning trans students from sports ... she highlighted WV‚Äôs low ratings in health education etc. as more pressing issues. He mumbled the bill was given to him to sign.#wtpBlue #DemVoice1 #ONEV1 üëáüèº https://t.co/f0lEN5w46n ‚Äî Samia Ali Salama ‚úçÔ∏è (@SamiaAliSalama) April 30 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
