"The Bagram exit was without pomp and ceremony" Poppy Harlow said. "It is seen as a symbolic victory for the Taliban who have been gaining significant ground in Afghanistan as the United States leaves. Our Anna Coren is there. It leaves question marks and danger for those on the ground in Afghanistan. I'm talking about Afghans." Coren said it's a "huge" vacuum and there's no guarantee Afghanistan won't once again become a safe haven for terrorists. "So much blood and treasure has been spent here in this country. $2 trillion. More than 2400 u.s. lives more than 100000 Afghan lives tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have died on the battlefield and continue to die. We know the security situation is deteriorating as the Taliban launches its offensive across the country particularly in the north gaining ground every day. But it had to come to an end. U.S. President Joe Biden he brought forward the date. It was September 11 and now you know as of today and overnight three planeloads flew out of U.S. and NATO forces.  "We know that General Scott Miller met with the president of Afghanistan to discuss America's ongoing assistance. And we know that America is not abandoning Afghanistan. They pledged $3.3 billion to provide security assistance in the coming year. And they are going to need it. We spoke to Dr. Abdullah Abdullah who is head of the peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban and he says if it was up to the Afghans the Americans would not have left. That now is not the right time because of the insurgency because of the gains the Taliban are making. It's time for Afghan forces to step up.  "Bagram Air Field was passed over to the Afghans today. There are 4000 Afghan security forces in place at Bagram Air Field. but there is no denying Poppy that America leaves Afghanistan you know not strong prosperous and stable but rather in a very precarious situation after 20 years in country." American troops have left Bagram Afghanistan’s largest air base officials said an outpost from which the U.S. waged war for nearly two decades.https://t.co/6mAG3W0iXV — The New York Times (@nytimes) July 2 2021 The White House is united in the decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.
