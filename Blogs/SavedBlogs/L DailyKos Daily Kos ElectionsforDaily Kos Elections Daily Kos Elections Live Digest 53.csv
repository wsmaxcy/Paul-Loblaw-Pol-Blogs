Ro Khanna over the weekend about his interest in waging an intra-party challenge to appointed Sen. Alex Padilla and she writes that Khanna “left the impression it is unlikely.” The congressman said “I’m happy where I am. I mean I haven’t ruled anything out in my future but I am chairing the environmental subcommittee [on the House Oversight Committee] and doing good work.” PA-Sen PA-17: Neither Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb nor his 2020 Republican opponent Sean Parnell have announced Senate bids yet but Politico reports that each man is “likely” to run. Lamb held off Parnell 51-49 last year as Joe Biden was carrying his suburban Pittsburgh seat 51-48. On Friday reporters Sarah Ferris and James Arkin wrote that Lamb “has begun telling some donors and supporters in recent days that he is likely to enter” the contest to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey though one unnamed source added that there were “no imminent plans” for him to announce. Lamb’s team said in response that while he was considering a bid “no decision has been made.” In a separate article published days later Arkin relayed that Parnell “is expected” to launch a Senate bid of his own. The former candidate’s spokesperson also publicly confirmed that Parnell was interested in this race though he also said that he was still making up his mind. The Washington Examiner said three months ago that Parnell was also thinking about another House campaign but there’s no indication that he’s still contemplating another run for the lower chamber. MN-Gov: Republican state Sen. Michelle Benson tells Axios’ Torey Van Oot that she’s considering taking on Democratic incumbent Tim Walz and will decide after the state budget is complete. Benson who is the chamber’s deputy majority leader has represented a safely red seat in the northern Twin Cities suburbs since 2011. Benson’s boss state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka has also been talking about running for a while and Van Oot says he’s “expected to make a public decision around the end of the [legislative] session.” No one knows exactly when the legislature will actually go home though as insiders tell the Minnesota Reformer they don’t expect it to finish its work before the scheduled May 17 adjournment date. One unnamed lobbyist adds “Watch to see how Gazelka’s governor ambitions play into an end of session deal. Gonna get messy.” NJ-Gov: Perennial candidate Hirsh Singh has publicized a poll conducted by Brad Parscale who was unceremoniously demoted as Trump’s first 2020 campaign manager that shows him leading former Assemblyman Jack Ciatterelli 22-20 in the June 8 Republican primary. Pretty much everyone has treated Ciatterelli who has the backing of the state's powerful county party leaders as the heavy frontrunner for months though this is the first survey we’ve seen of the primary.    RI-Gov: State Treasurer Seth Magaziner’s team has confirmed that he is thinking about taking on incumbent Dan McKee who was elevated from lieutenant governor to governor in March in next year’s Democratic primary. That statement came after Magaziner who is termed-out of his current post unveiled his largest quarterly-haul ever to which the Boston Globe’s Dan McGowan responded “If you didn’t know he’s almost certainly running for governor next year.” Magaziner outraised McKee $302000 to $284000 during the first three months of the year and the treasurer ended March with a huge $1.3 million to $451000 cash-on-hand edge. Two other Democrats who are eyeing this race Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza brought in smaller sums though they both still had larger war chests than McKee: Gorbea took in $159000 for the quarter and had $547000 in the bank while Elorza raised just $87000 but had $955000 on-hand. Physician Luis Daniel Muñoz who is McGee’s only declared foe entered the primary in April after the new quarter began. AZ-06: Democrat Jevin Hodge who lost a 2020 race for one of the five seats on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors by a tiny 50.05-49.95 margin announced Monday that he’d challenge Republican Rep. David Schweikert. Schweikert himself prevailed 52-48 as Trump was carrying his district by a similar 51-47 spread. FL-13: Sunshine State political observers anticipate that Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist will announce Tuesday that he’s giving up his House seat to wage another campaign for governor and several politicians from both parties have already expressed interest in running to succeed him. This St. Petersburg-based seat backed Joe Biden 51-47 but Republicans will be in a position to draw themselves more favorable lines. On the Democratic side the Tampa Bay Times’ William March writes that state Rep. Ben Diamond and former Department of Defense official Eric Lynn each “are considered almost certain to run” though neither would commit to anything publicly. Diamond said he would “certainly re-evaluate my options” if Crist gave up this seat while Lynn said he’d “take a serious look” at an open seat race. March also mentions St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman who will be termed-out of office early next year and state Rep. Michele Rayner as possibilities. A Diamond-Lynn primary would also be a rematch between the two. Lynn campaigned for the 13th District in the 2016 cycle and remained in the race several months after Crist got in. He eventually dropped out and sought an open state House seat but Diamond beat him 54-46. Lynn though still has $140000 in his federal campaign account that he could use for a new congressional race. On the Republican side Anna Paulina Luna and Amanda Makki each said they were thinking about a second campaign. Luna beat Makki who had the support of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy 36-28 in last year’s primary and she went on to lose the general election to Crist 53-47 in a contest that didn’t attract any serious outside spending. March also name-drops former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker though he notes that he comes up “when any high-profile political office in Pinellas [County] comes open.” He’s not kidding: Baker turned down Republican attempts to recruit him for Congress in 2014 2016 and 2020 and he’s been been talked about as a possible contender for the state Senate next year. NH-01: 2020 Republican nominee Matt Mowers tells WMUR that he’ll decide whether to seek a rematch with Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas after his child is born in June. Last year Pappas beat Mowers 51-46 as Joe Biden was carrying this swing seat by a similar 52-46 margin. Republican map-makers though will have the opportunity to make this constituency more conservative. OH-15: State Sen. Stephanie Kunze and state Rep. Jeff LaRe have each announced that they’ll compete in the August Republican primary to succeed GOP Rep. Steve Stivers who will officially resign from Congress later this month. They join a field that currently consists of state Sen. Bob Peterson state Rep. Brian Stewart and Fairfield County Commissioner Jeff Fix.  MT-01 MT-02: Former Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke announced on Friday that'd he run for Montana's new congressional seat a day after filing paperwork with the FEC. Zinke represented the state's at-large district from 2015 to 2017 before serving as Donald Trump's interior secretary a position he was reportedly forced out of after less than two years. During his tenure Zinke was the target of 18 different federal investigations—some of which were never publicly resolved—and aggressively sought to roll back environmental protections while promoting expanded fossil fuel extraction. That record could haunt Zinke back home where he long sought to cast himself as a modern-day Teddy Roosevelt concerned with protecting public lands and waterways while serving in the state legislature. Though Montana is a solidly red state the rights of hunters anglers and outdoor recreationists are often issues of great concern in local politics even among Republicans—as Zinke's own attempted branding shows. Meanwhile some Democrats are also eyeing the opportunity that Montana's new district will present. Businesswoman Whitney Williams who unsuccessfully sought her party's gubernatorial nomination last year tells Inside Elections’ Jacob Rubashkin she’s considering a bid for "the seat my Dad once proudly held." Williams' father Pat Williams represented Montana's 1st District from 1979 until it was eliminated in 1993 then held its at-large seat for two more terms after that making him the last Democrat to represent the state in the House. The elder Williams' old district covered the more liberal western slice of Montana and could be resuscitated under the next map. Another Democrat who ran for office in 2020 public health expert Cora Neumann is also reportedly considering a House bid. Neumann was a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for Senate last year but dropped out after former Gov. Steve Bullock was lured into the race at the filing deadline. OR-04: Republican Alek Skarlatos announced Sunday that he’d seek a rematch against incumbent Peter DeFazio a veteran Democrat who defeated him 52-46 after a surprisingly expensive race. Skarlatos made his declaration about two weeks after he learned that even though Oregon Democrats control the governorship and both chambers of the legislature the party will not be able to help DeFazio or anyone else during the new round of redistricting.  That’s because as we explained in the Voting Rights Roundup Democrats reached a deal with Republican lawmakers where Team Blue agreed to give up their majorities on the legislature's redistricting committees. In exchange for granting GOP veto power over any new congressional maps Democrats received assurances that Republicans would back off some of their unprecedented obstruction of routine legislative business. If Democrats don’t receive the requisite GOP support now needed to implement new congressional districts it would be up to a court to craft a new map. No one knows how that scenario would impact DeFazio’s 4th Congressional District especially now that the Beaver State is gaining a seat though he’s represented competitive turf under several previous maps. The current version of this constituency which includes the southern Willamette Valley and Oregon’s southern coast supported Joe Biden 51-47—a close showing though a veritable landslide compared to Hilary Clinton’s 46.1-46.0 victory four years before. DeFazio himself prevailed by double digits in every single campaign following his first victory in 1986 but Skarlatos had a much more prominent profile than any of his previous foes. The former Oregon National Guardsman had made global headlines when he helped stop a terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train in 2015 and he’d gone on to place third on "Dancing With The Stars" and play himself in a 2018 movie called "The 15:17 to Paris" that was directed by Clint Eastwood. Still Skarlatos initially struggled to bring in cash and he seemed destined to be on the wrong side of another DeFazio blowout. That impression began to change over the summer however when the incumbent began running negative ads against his opponent. Skarlatos also dramatically ramped up his financial efforts and while much of his haul was eaten up by fundraising services he still brought in more than enough to run a serious campaign.  National Republican groups deployed just $275000 and went off the air weeks before Election Day but their Democratic counterparts sensing trouble dropped close to $2.2 million to protect DeFazio. The incumbent ended up prevailing 52-46 which was easily his closest showing in any of his 17 re-election campaigns. TX-15: The Washington Post reports that Democrats are imploring Rep. Vicente González “to stay in Congress after his neighboring Democrat [Filemon] Vela decided to call it quits.” González who was elected to what has long been a safely blue Rio Grande Valley seat in 2016 has not publicly expressed interest in retiring though there’s little question he’d be in for a much tougher campaign than he’s ever experienced before. González prevailed last year 51-48 as Joe Biden won by a small 50-49 spread and Republicans will once again control redistricting. Cincinnati OH Mayor: The Queen City holds its open seat nonpartisan primary on Tuesday and while there’s little question that a pair of Democrats will advance to the November general election the Cincinnati Enquirer’s Jason Williams says that even close observers have little idea which two they’ll be. The contender with the most money by far is Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Aftab Pureval; Pureval who was the 2018 Democratic nominee against GOP Rep. Steve Chabot has hauled in $231000 since Jan. 1 which is $3000 more than his five rivals combined. Behind him with almost $100000 raised is businessman Gavi Begtrup a first-time contender.  Also in the mix are City Councilman David Mann who represented the area in the U.S. House for one term in the early 1990s; businessman Raffel Prophett; and state Sen. Cecil Thomas. The only non-Democrat in the contest is Herman Najoli an independent who brought up the rear with just over $1000 raised. Cleveland OH Mayor OH-11: Democratic state Sen. Sandra Williams announced Monday that she would compete in this year’s contest for mayor of Cleveland rather than run in the special election for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. Williams who represents the East Side in the legislature would be the second woman to serve as mayor as well as the first Black woman elected to lead the city. New York City NY Mayor: City Comptroller Scott Stringer has lost a number of high-profile endorsements in the days since a woman named Jane Kim accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2001. The Working Families Party Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Adriano Espaillat and several state legislators and members of the New York City Council have withdrawn their support from the comptroller who has repeatedly denied Kim’s allegations and vowed to remain in the June 22 Democratic primary. Meanwhile Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams received an endorsement on Monday from Donovan Richards his counterpart in Queens. Adams also earned the support of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. last week. Austin TX Ballot: On Saturday voters in Austin supported Prop. D which will move mayoral elections from midterm to presidential cycles by a 67-33 margin. In order to realign the calendar next year’s contest to succeed termed-out Mayor Steve Adler will be for an abbreviated two-year term while another election will take place in 2024 for a regular four-year term. Austinites also approved Prop. E which would institute instant-runoff voting for local elections 59-41. However state law as the Austin-American Statesman explains doesn’t currently allow this system of voting so the paper says that “the most this measure can do is get Austin ready to go in the event the state ever decides to allow it.” Voters though did decisively reject other referendums that would have changed how local elections and government would function. Prop. H which would have implemented a "democracy voucher" system of public campaign financing failed by a 57-43 margin. Prop. F which would have greatly strengthened the mayor’s powers went down by a punishing 86-14 a showing the paper says was “a margin wider than any in recent memory.” VA-AG: Del. Jay Jones new commercial features him with Gov. Ralph Northam his most prominent backer in the June 8 Democratic primary. Jones explains “This campaign is about leading the way on criminal justice reform and policing” to which the governor responds “My proudest day and you were standing right there beside me—was when we ended the death penalty.” The spot does not mention the man Jones is hoping to beat next month Attorney General Mark Herring. AZ-Sen: Republicans got their first noteworthy contender on Monday when Jim Lamon the chair of the solar energy and construction company Depcom Power announced that he would take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Lamon does not appear to have run for office before though local NBC reporter Brahm Resnik said last month that he founded a conservative voter registration group in the state and has spoken to a number of Arizona Republican organizations. IL-17: Politico reports that Peoria City Councilwoman Beth Jensen is considering running to succeed Rep. Cheri Bustos a fellow Democrat who unexpectedly announced her retirement on Friday from this competitive seat. Jensen doesn’t appear to have said anything publicly yet while Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara and state Rep. Maurice West each aren’t ruling anything out for themselves. Politico also name-drops two other Democrats state Reps. Jehan Gordon-Booth and Mike Halpin as possibilities. Mayors: Here’s a recap of the key mayoral elections that went down in Texas on Saturday. Two races where no candidate took a majority of the vote will head to an as-yet unscheduled runoff. Arlington TX Mayor: Former police officer Jim Ross and former City Councilman Michael Glaspie will square off once more after Ross who was endorsed by outgoing Republican Mayor Jeff Williams led the way with 47% while Glaspie who ran on a platform highlighting inequalities in the city took 21%. City Councilman Marvin Sutton rounded out the candidates who received double-digit support with 15%.  Fort Worth TX Mayor: Mattie Parker the former chief of staff to outgoing Republican Mayor Betsy Price and Tarrant County Democratic Party Chairwoman Deborah Peoples will meet again in a runoff. Peoples led Parker 34-31 while City Councilman Brian Byrd who was the second-best fundraiser in the field behind Parker finished third with 15%. According to The Dallas Morning News Parker would be the youngest mayor of a major city in the country while Peoples would be Fort Worth’s first Black mayor. Plano TX Mayor: Businessman John Muns defeated realtor former City Councilwoman Lily Bao 53-43 to win this seat outright a victory that represents a continued shift in this former Republican stronghold. According to one analysis Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Plano in living memory last year and Muns though a registered Republican had the endorsement of the Collin County Democratic Party. Housing and development was the dominant issue in this race. It’s been a hot-button in Plano as it’s grown from a northern suburb of Dallas into one of the biggest cities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Bao who was endorsed by Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton was a staunch opponent of housing complexes and mixed-use housing vowing to “Keep Plano Suburban”. Muns took a decidedly less hardline stance stressing a desire for balance between Plano’s residential character and the need for further mixed-use development of the city’s land.  San Antonio TX Mayor: Incumbent Ron Nirenberg defeated Greg Brockhouse 62-31 to win a third term a dominant showing compared to his narrow 51-49 win in the pair's first matchup in 2019. In that earlier contest the conservative Brockhouse had the support of the police and firefighter unions but both declined to endorse him this time around. Labor continued to be a major topic in this race though as Proposition B which would have repealed the right of the city’s police union to engage in collective bargaining was on the ballot alongside the mayoral race. Nirenberg a progressive independent declined to take a stand on the measure which narrowly failed 51-49.
