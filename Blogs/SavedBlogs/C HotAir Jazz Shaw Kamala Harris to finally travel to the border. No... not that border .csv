C, Kamala Harris to finally travel to the border. No... not that border , Jazz Shaw, 2021-04-14, After weeks on end of enduring headlines in the media asking why the Biden administrations point person on the border crisis Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t gone to the border an announcement was finally made today. Harris will indeed be heading south for talks about the border situation. Eventually. But the border she’s going to isn’t the one between the United States and Mexico. It’s the one between Mexico and Guatemala. And saying she’s going “to” the border is probably more than a little misleading as well. She’ll be flying over the border to visit officials in that country. But hey… it’s still at least something that looks more like her actual job than hanging out in a bakery in Chicago right? (Fox News) Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday that she will travel to Guatemala and Mexico as part of her role in tackling the “root causes” of the swirling migration crisis at the southern border — as she faces intense criticism for her alleged lack of action on the crisis… “I have been asked to lead the issue of dealing with root causes in the Northern Triangle similar to what the then-Vice President did many years ago” she said. “But I will tell you these are issues that aren’t going to be addressed overnight.”  On plans for travel Harris said “we have plans in the works to go to Guatemala as soon as possible” later saying she would also be stopping in Mexico. So let’s see if we have this straight. Harris is making a trip to Guatemala but we don’t know the date. It’s just going to be “as soon as possible.” And she’ll also be stopping in Mexico. Fair enough. We really do have to wonder if the reason there’s no set date for the Guatemala trip is that nobody told the Guatemalans about it yet. After all as you may have already heard Jen Psaki announced this week that the Biden administration had struck a deal with Guatemala to enhance their border security with Honduras. This caused the Guatemalan government to release a statement saying that they had no idea what she was talking about and there was no new deal and the border security measures she referenced had been put in place before Biden was even in office.  Has anyone bothered to tell President Alejandro Guimmattei that the American Vice President is planning to come to his country and discuss ways to stop migrants from heading north? (I’ve checked their Twitter feed and don’t see any announcements about it yet but we’ll keep an eye on it. They are however eradicating millions of marijuana plants this month.) This remains a rather surreal situation. The Biden White House continues to insist that Kamala Harris is the point person on the border situation but she has nothing to do with the actual situation on the border. The DHS chief was thrown under the bus for that chore. Harris is supposedly addressing “root causes” of migration in the Northern Triangle countries. While that’s an admirable goal nobody has had much luck with it over the past decade or two primarily because those countries always want pallets of American cash before making any sort of deal. And if you send them money it seems to mysteriously disappear. The reality here is that the Democrats are still desperately trying to groom Kamala Harris (or “the heiress” as she’s reportedly called by White House staffers) to take the big chair either in 2024 or before if it can be managed. Saying she’s “taking charge” of the border situation makes it look likes she’s doing presidential things. But allowing a picture to leak out of her near the actual southern border while it’s going to hell in a handbasket would be awful optics. So we’re being fed headlines instead with some of them being entirely fake as I mentioned above. Others like this one are vague and ambiguous. But there are still plenty of media outlets lapping them up. Personally I don’t care whether it turns out to be the DHS chief Harris Joe Biden or one of his bitey dogs. They need to find somebody to get this border situation under control and they need to start seriously working on it yesterday. Running a press-snippet presidency without any real action may make the NeverTrumpers feel better but it’s not holding our country together.
