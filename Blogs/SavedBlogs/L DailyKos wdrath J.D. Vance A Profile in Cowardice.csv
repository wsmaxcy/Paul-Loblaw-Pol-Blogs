L, J.D. Vance: A Profile in Cowardice, wdrath, 2021-07-06, J.D. Vance the venture capitalist who is running for the Republican nomination to succeed Rob Portman (R-OH) who is retiring from the U.S. Senate has shown everyone his true colors. And in case anyone thought that there were still a few Republicans of principle left in this world well sorry to disappoint you but Vance has demonstrated that he is right at home with the rest of the sniveling slimy unprincipled cowards who collectively make up today’s Republican Party.  www.politico.com/... Vance had some relatively mild criticism of Donald J. Trump a few years ago particularly with regards to Trump’s hate-filled positions and rehtoric regarding immigrants which Vance then described as being “reprehensible.” Vance who is also the author of the best-seller “Hillbilly Elegy” has now apologized for criticizing Trump after announcing his candidacy for Senate last week. In other words now that he’s running for the Republican nomination for Senate in a state that Trump easily won with overwhelming support from Republicans last year Vance has...well….lets call it “changed” his position. Or rather lets say he has….”conveniently changed his position to opportunisitically try to paper over the past in order to hoodwink people into thinking he has some kind of principles.” Vance’s tweets criticizing Trump have also conveniently disappeared from his Twitter account proving once again that among the main requisites for being an accepted member of the Republican Party is to be not only shamelessly unprincipled but shamelessly dishonest too trying to rewrite the past to suit ones current aspirations in hopes that voters won’t notice or care. The word “hypocrisy” hardly even begins to accurately describe him. But one thing he won’t ever have to worry about is being accused of being courageous for standing up for his principles. Snake oil salesman is a term that comes to mind.
