L, 2 Polls: Who Won the Week by BIPM - and - Your Sense of Direction ☼ Sunday Good News, 2thanksforGood News, 2021-06-27, Good News: We bring it we make it.  The Good Gnus group is a community of readers writers activists supporters community builders and patriots. We begin gathering every day at 7 a.m. ET to celebrate national good news. Our most active members are of course a subgroup of members of Daily Kos whose Front Pages celebrate “News Community Action.” However you don’t have to be a member of Daily Kos to be a Gnusie. We are realists not fools idiots or ostriches. We seek the truth. We know we live in a world where active nefarious and evil decision-makers do very bad things and create stress and anxiety in us our loved ones our friends our neighbors and our allies and destroy people and systems we hold dear. However we choose to focus on the good news that people create around the country. Sometimes we ourselves create Good News. Together we are strong and resilient. We return regularly to these pages to revitalize. In a Good News Roundup the weight of bearing good news is not borne by the author alone: Gnusies can be counted on to adorn the comment section with good news. Often commenters create three times as many comments as Recommendations! If you cannot linger with us for hours I recommend you return in the mid or late afternoon learn who your favorite commenters are and Find their names on return visits. We count on certain favorite Gnusies to bless us in the comments with humor hope history and analysis every day. We bring good news and we create good news.   Gnusie Bill in Portland Maine lets me repeat the results of his research. He arrayed the following items in his popular Who Won the Week? poll in Friday’s Cheers and Jeers. Many people already voted in that poll. Please enjoy Bill’s on-point analysis and wit vote in his poll Rec his diaries get on his bandwagon send him a donation and earn his blessing.   Cheers and Jeers archive and future editions here. Way way more than 2 thanks to The One our Wicked Wizard of Wit and writer of Who Won the Week Willhelm von kosland!  Bill’s Friday poll is here. Who won the week for you? Who made a winning move after Bill's deadline on Friday?  Science provides headlights to show us risks along our road. Certain recent findings may be troubling. However they give us hope because they show us how to fix things. Overnight News Science Digest by Besame 1. Unravelling the Enigma of Bird Magnetoreception (Nature) Eric J. Warrant: Arguably the greatest mystery in sensory biology is magnetoreception — how animals sense Earth’s magnetic field and use it as a compass to determine their spatial orientation … The identity of the biological tissue responsible for sensing the field’s direction and the sensory mechanism that underpins this type of navigation have remained an enigma. In migratory birds the main contenders are magnetically sensitive proteins called cryptochromes which are located in the retina2. However proof has been lacking that these proteins truly possess the magnetic sensitivity and physical properties needed to detect Earth’s extremely weak magnetic field. Writing in Nature Xu et al.3 provide this proof in vitro bringing us tantalizingly close to solving the mystery of magnetoreception.   There are currently two main hypotheses for how animals sense Earth’s magnetic field14 (as well as some alternative hypotheses put forward in the past few years56). One proposes that as an animal changes direction crystals of the oxidized-iron compound magnetite (Fe3O4) located in its body and aligned with the field exert a rotational force — called torque — on mechanoreceptors with which they are in physical contact. This might thereby signal changes in body alignment through the opening and closing of mechanoreceptor ion channels. The other main hypothesis (Fig. 1) proposes that when cryptochrome proteins absorb photons of light and become ‘photoexcited’ they form magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates known as radical pairs. Variations in the yield of their reaction product (the form of the cryptochrome that contains a radical molecule called FADH•) are thought to signal the animal’s direction with respect to Earth’s magnetic field78.

The researchers named the new species Homo longi and gave it the nickname “Dragon Man." https://t.co/ejyHHl5IGD  The skull belonged to a mature male who had a huge brain massive brow ridges deep set eyes and a bulbous nose. It had remained hidden in an abandoned well for 85 years after a laborer came across it at a construction site in China. The researchers named the new species Homo longi and gave it the nickname “Dragon Man” for the Dragon River region of northeast China where the skull was discovered. The team said that Homo longi and not the Neanderthals was the extinct human species mostly closely related to our own. If confirmed that would change how scientists envision the origin of Homo sapiens which has been built up over the years from fossil discoveries and the analysis of ancient DNA. But a number of experts disputed this conclusion published in three papers that provided the first detailed look at the fossil. Nevertheless many still thought that the find could help scientists reconstruct the human family tree and how modern humans emerged. All the experts who reviewed the data in the studies said it was a magnificent fossil.   Tortmaster: If you would like some brilliant Artworks before your fireworks on July 4th please stop by the KOS Art Expo and Memorial. A lot of talented Kossacks will exhibit for your pleasure. I've had the opportunity to take an early peek behind the curtains and it truly is a Museum of the Beautiful and the Curious. Here's a painting by Ralphdog from a previous Expo: Image: Painting of a country road stretching into the distance by Kosack Ralphdog.

Thank you Starhawk! This is a quite detailed sketch of a gnu drawn in brown green and black. A happy and dynamic gnu dances on its left hind leg in a classic rampant heraldric pose. Joyful letters prance above and behind the mane: “Happy Dance.” Signature: Nick Korolev 2021.  Thank you for fighting for truth and justice with all us Gnusies! 40% of our Readers don’t visit every day 50% of us do and 10% are here for the first time! We all do what we can. For 3-1/2 years we’ve shared positive news laughed organized resisted rebelled revolted without being revolting relied rested mentored created crossed rivers chewed our cud puffed methane out both ends and laughed. Here’s looking at you kid and standing upwind! As always please share more Good News than I can find or provide.  This is a group diary and by my power I declare this Good Gnus Salo(o)n open! Let the good-news sharing and community building begin! Power with not power over ❤️ ✊ ❤️ 2thanks (he him)     If you enjoy my work on Daily Kos I’d appreciate a Gnusie bump large or small via PayPal or CashApp ($ipaywill). Gifts from supportive Kosacks help me pay for my wife’s medicines. If you’ve sent me a gift recently I am 2thankful!
