L, PWB Peeps: Toosdai Evening: Srs Not-Srs for Today May 4 Illustrated!, elenacarlenaforPWB Peeps, 2021-05-04, Welcome back to the odd and whimsical poetery of the Peeps related to holidaze! Let’s investigate what today is because we need all the holidaze we can celebrate right? Furtunately our country is back to more or less normal government about which all critters are very happy! Still every day seems to be many holidays. Which is good because we all have our favorites. So I will pick out one or two and you can click the link above if you’re curious about the rest. This is an Open Thread so please feel free to add your favorite pomes and photoes and holidaze for today in the Comments! Renewal Day is an absolutely spectacular day. It's a day of new and old beginnings. Things get old and out of sorts. We lose touch with friends loved ones and relationships. For whatever reason we "let "it" go. Well whatever "it" is today is the day to renew it rejuvenate it and bring the spark back into it. -snip- Renewal Day is not limited to renewing relationships and social issues. You can also renew: Get the picture? Good. Now get into Renewal Day!  from Nine Poems of Renewal by Daniel Lichtenstein-Boris There will be a day that we will meetAnd brush our feet in soft sweet grassAnd brush aside those walls of thornsThat hide our past defend the self I had a dream that outside these wallsOur hidden hovels our cellphone screensWe’d dance in forests green and dampAnd to the leaves and bark would sing To unleash the spirit from its chainsAnd the mountains and sea would unveil a pathA place where one could breathe the rushing airThat no time clock brand or code constrains Free of measured time and egos spentIn some clear fresh place to love and reflect [Daniel Lichtenstein-Boris states that he has been engaged in struggles for social justice for 20 years including over 10 as a professional union and community organizer researcher and campaigner. “I see the world and want to change it.  I believe in a vision of a better society.  I believe in you and I believe that together we can be what we will to be. I am just another Human Being.”] Please to remember that Pootie Diaries post twice a day!

And Finally In Especially Loving Memory of Ginger the World’s Best Pootie (and maybe Oreo too!) UPDATE: We are currently having thunderstorms and our power and Internet went out for a short period of time. Everything is back but I don’t know for how long (but I now have a flashlight next to me which will certainly help us cope!). If I stop responding I’ll catch up tomorrow. Stay safe out there — I hear it’s much more stormy South of us (NY).
