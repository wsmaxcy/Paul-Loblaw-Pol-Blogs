L, Enzo and our Planetary Marathon, Irene Fowler, 2021-07-01,                         Foreword To honour our shared humanity and in a bid to highlight our pressing concerns for the condition of mankind and our planet Irene Fowler (Nigeria) and I (U.S.A.) collaborated on the publication of this article - Blair Gelbond Perhaps you have read the recent popular little novel The Art of Driving in the Rain. It features two characters - Denny a race-car driver and his dog Enzo. Denny treats Enzo as his best friend watching videos of car races with him talking with him about the fine points of winning races like declaring "Your car goes where your eyes go"; Enzo takes it all in. Denny senses his dog's acute intelligence but can't be sure exactly what Enzo comprehends. Funny thing though: in actuality Enzo has an extremely keen human-level mind and he is getting ready to be born in his next life as a human being. He can only bark but his thinking is crystal clear and his empathy is as deep a river. With a mix of sadness and acceptance Enzo tells the reader: "Gestures are all I have." One day Denny takes Enzo out on the race track for a treat. He checks out the territory taking his Bimmer out for some "hot laps" before his competitors arrive. Enzo loves it barking twice (as agreed beforehand with Denny) to say "Go Faster!" Denny instructs Enzo to have "Big eyes Far eyes." *** Enzo by Irene Fowler The cosmic marathon to choose life stave off earth's demise A race away from the cruel yawning abyss to an earth rebuilt Imperiled human and planetary life all mortgaged to the hilt Hazard signs aplenty blaring sirens red lights crazily blink Unprecedented! alarming! dangerous! buzzwords for Rodin's great 'Thinker' Multitudes numbed by denial distraction daily drudgery Misguided leaders glibly tout past and future worldly glory The oppressed somnolent and carefree buy every fabricated story Society upended by obscene wildly disparate income brackets Bare pantries of the work-a-day homeless scavenge garbage buckets Still trillion-dollar budgets fund savage unending war rackets Ascendant oligarchic-dictatorship steering ships of state Flailing democracy teetering on autocracy's soiled slippery slate The duo's horns locked in a macabre ugly dance of death Individual rights of the demos gasping for air with every laboured breath Mother Earth-Gaia-Bundu sacked hacked a mausoleum for manmade gunk On life support her precious fertile womb shredded rendered junk Earth aborts future life poisoned air chokes sullied oceans wail In 'hair on fire' messaging to the planet she rents her mystical sacred veil Mankind's cash-cow skirting ruination dastardly marred Nuclear arsenals readied absent exit route to Sirius Vega or Achernar Loving kind compassionate Enzo barks in eager anticipation Heart yearning bursting with pride to join the human experimentation Big far eyes see distant possibilities turbocharge his race to earth For now he tells us 'gestures are all I have before rebirth' Enzo gazes adoringly at humanity; licking rolling snuggling wagging his bushy tail Gentle trusting dog eyes full of love and all that love entails. *** Planetary Marathon - Some Sustenance for the Long-run by Blair Gelbond We hope in these pieces to look forward to the daunting marathon ahead. As a species we face a nearly overwhelming and frankly frightening cluster of conundrums. While our attention may be given to the politics and catastrophes of the day we will not be thinking much about the upcoming decades. But the problems we are facing are not going away and if we proceed with business as usual are likely to worsen. Although Donald Trump has left the White House he and many other neofascists continue their destructive trajectory. He has evoked the demons in the most character-disordered among us. He has also given cover to influential sociopathic personality disorders and those harboring the desire to abuse power. Many of us understand that the American experiment in democracy is teetering on the edge and during the next election cycles may well be damaged beyond repair. Such an outcome will invariably speed up other deadly threats that are already present: the collapse of world civilization and the destruction of much of the Biosphere. The deep-seated drive to destroy will predictably synchronize in a ghastly way with the devastation the world systems we have so far taken for granted: species diversity access to food fuel and water a relatively stable climate and economic (even though grossly inequitable) stability. Many of us still do not want to hear this: in the next decades the human species will be facing some grim realities. We may tell ourselves that this description is hyperbole exaggeration or hysteria. We may be able to slow down some of the more shocking realities but given the insane obscene greed of corporations and our own penchant for inertia and denial it appears that a massive breakdown is coming. Human population and consumption are increasing at the same time as essential resources such as freshwater fish stocks topsoil and oil reserves are in decline. While reversals in the economy have left many feeling desperate about how they are going to manage trillions of dollars are spent on the making of war. It is no surprise that so many of us are experiencing a profound loss of confidence in the future. We no longer can take for granted that the resources on which we depend - food fuel and drinkable water - will be available. Or even that our civilization will survive or that conditions on our planet will remain hospitable for complex forms of life. Given the complexity of the situation it can seem quite appealing to remain ignore-ant addicted to keeping busy and remaining distracted - even with the news of the day. We are facing the persistence of a global nuclear threat and bioweapons environmental degradation the world over overpopulation and an apparent de-population strategy the widening gap between and the rich and the poor around the world and the role of malignant narcissist political military and business leaders. All these need to be regarded in light of the inter-retroactions between these and other problems crises and threats. When taken together this state of affairs can be accurately labeled "a poly-crisis." As if hypnotized we are rushing as fast as possible toward self-destruction and destruction of the Biosphere. We seem to be suffering from a monomaniacal persistence in error and a stubborn inability to learn from our mistakes. We are acting out our destructive impulses virtually without restraint. We are attacking the continued viability of life on Earth in so many different ways that it seems as if we are determined to make our suicide attempts be successful. We are truly living through the beginning of a world-transforming evolutionary crisis a planetary rite of passage. To see our predicament from this perspective may be the first step in using our situation much like a tribal initiation - capable of functioning as an ordeal that will help catalyze our maturity. Whether the human species and the Biosphere will remain viable remains to be seen. As the world crisis deepens we will need to learn to honor our pain for the world and bring our compassion to bear on daily life. Simple as it may sound what we need is to open our hearts and experience the tender love we often feel for our animal companions and the affection they reciprocate. Without rejecting what we have learned in life we each can rediscover our innocence. Our actions to preserve our world need to come from this place. The obvious question for each of us to ask ourselves and each other: How can we strengthen and support our intention to act so we can best play our part in healing our world?
