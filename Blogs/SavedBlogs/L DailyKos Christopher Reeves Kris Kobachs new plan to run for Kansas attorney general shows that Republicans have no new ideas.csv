L, Kris Kobach's new plan to run for Kansas attorney general shows that Republicans have no new ideas, Christopher Reeves, 2021-04-29, As Americans have time to digest a bold proud vision of the future Republicans everywhere seem to be grasping at well nothing. No new ideas no vision for America and no real plan. Well there is a plan: It seems to be a plan to divide Americans against each other and trying to stop any progress toward anything. When the well runs dry and you are willing to sit on your hands and oppose helping kids drink lead-free water what kind of candidate can you really get to stand up for you? Enter Kris Kobach. Yes that Kris Kobach the former Kansas secretary of state infamous for his work on getting huge fees from towns and pushing false narratives about who was voting. Seeking a political comeback he is now throwing his hat into the ring to be Sunflower State’s attorney general. Right now in America there are 26 Republican attorneys general and 24 Democratic attorneys general. The Republican attorneys general have often been at the forefront of the GOP battle against democracy. From Business Insider: Within Biden's first 100 days in office Republican attorneys general have already sued the Democratic president's administration 19 times according to the Republican Attorneys General Association and Dr. Paul Nollette a political-science professor at Marquette University who keeps track of such cases on his website. In total Republicans have filed 10 multistate lawsuits and nine single state lawsuits against the Biden administration. At this point in Trump's administration Democratic attorneys general had only filed four lawsuits a RAGA spokesman told Insider. Democratic infrastructure and voters sometimes forget about down-ballot races. Attorney general races offer us the chance to protect the opportunities of American citizens. Voting rights civil rights police action state resources—those are all things a state attorneys general can command and use for good or ill. But Republican attorneys general don’t see a new vision. They can only look back at the past and find themselves working hard to say “no” while suing to strip away peoples’ rights—on your dime.  There are no new ideas and opportunists like Kris Kobach know that’s good news for his campaign.
