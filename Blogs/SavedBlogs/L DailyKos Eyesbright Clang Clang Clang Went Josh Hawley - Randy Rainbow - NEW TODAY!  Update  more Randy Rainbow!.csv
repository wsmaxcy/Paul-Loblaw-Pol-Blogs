L, "Clang Clang Clang Went Josh Hawley" - Randy Rainbow - NEW TODAY!  Update:  more Randy Rainbow!, Eyesbright, 2021-05-10, This one is a bit different from his usual but the music is at least as great as ever the rhyming is even better than his usual (by far) and the choreography/production work is the best yet!  Randy Rainbow is as usual Fabulous!  Just viewed the following (it’s only been up for five days).  Note that the image on the right is Randy Rainbow for real!  That’s not what I expected him to look like (I’m not sure what I expected).  Note too that the person interviewing him is also a parody artist Gordon Lustig.This Randy Rainbow offering deserves some more eyeballs!
