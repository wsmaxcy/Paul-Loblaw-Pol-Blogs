L, Throwback Thursday: 'Proud' Hannity Shares Stage With Gaetz, Frances Langum, 2021-04-08, It was a lovefest between Sean Hannity and Matt Gaetz back in the summer of 2018.   Hannity contrary once again to stated Fox News guidelines appeared at a campaign event for Ron DeSantis with Rep. Matt Gaetz.  Hannity said he was "proud to share a stage with these men."  Today?  Not so much as the Media Matters headline reads "Sean Hannity and his Fox News colleagues leave Matt Gaetz for dead." Matt Gaetz has appeared on Hannity 127 times since August of 2017.  But not lately!!!   Hannity "has not mentioned the embattled congressman’s travails -- not on his prime-time TV show not on his nationally syndicated radio show not on his website and not on Twitter" according to Media Matters. These days Gaetz gets bupkis coverage while AOC and Hunter Biden's laptop get all the attention.   Amid growing scandal involving Matt Gaetz Fox has spent twice as much time complaining about AOCThe Department of Justice is reportedly investigating Gaetz for sex trafficking but Fox is still aiming its ire at its favorite target Ocasio-Cortezhttps://t.co/DeEMP1OvOJ pic.twitter.com/1ub7d3CXR4 — Lis Power (@LisPower1) April 6 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
