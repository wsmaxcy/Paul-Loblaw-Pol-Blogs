L, Happy Day after July 4th a Colorado State Open Thread July 5th 2021., ColoTim, 2021-07-05, The Colorado State Open Thread is for people interested in sharing thoughts ideas companionship and cookies for the square(ish) state we know as Colorado.  If you would like to join in please think a thought type it into the comments box preview it and post it.  That’s all it takes. Last night on the 4th of July Mrs. Colotim and I went with some friends (Trump supporters but the people who opened their house to us when we were evacuated from Estes Park last year during the fires) to a restaurant on the edge of Lake Estes to have dinner and watch the fireworks for the first time in two years.  While fireworks have been cancelled in a number of areas of Colorado our daily storms have really wet the ground and plant life so we didn’t have much worry about any fires.  It was very nice and relaxing to have our guests come and stay for the weekend — I think they really enjoyed themselves and they were able to forget most of their cares and worries while enjoying the beautiful views great and bountiful food and the fireworks show in one of the prettiest environments in the state.   Here are some attempts at photos —       How did you celebrate the 4th of July? Do you have any photos you’d care to share? Our main BBQ with the smoked pork ribs was on the 3rd because we were going to have food at the restaurant on the 4th.  I look forward to hearing about any gatherings you had any traditions you might have been able to restart this year after last year’s Covid cancellations or just any thoughts you might have about the meaning and traditions for the country on the 4th.  Or is anything else on your mind? The floor is yours.
