L, Ohio GOP Lawmaker Hilariously Mocked For Taking Founding Fathers Literally, David Moye, 2021-04-22, The House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation that would turn Washington D.C. into a state but some people are protesting the move with potentially dubious claims. Case in point: Ohio state Rep. Mike Loychik (R) took to Twitter on Thursday to assert that the founding fathers never wanted D.C. to be a state. The founders never intended for Washington DC to become a state. It’s true that Washington was made into a separate district rather than a state but many Twitter users weren’t impressed with Loychik’s argument. They pointed out a whole bunch of things that are an accepted part of American culture that the founders also never intended (and vice versa). Take a look: A lot of them owned slaves so excuse me if I'm not compelled by their intentions. https://t.co/g8MUTmzko0 The founders also thought that human beings should be property. Things change. https://t.co/fPEvTqQ1wa The founders never intended for women or Black people to vote and yet here we are. https://t.co/3QieMMzb78 The founders never intended for this man to become a President. https://t.co/UfvXvos0iq pic.twitter.com/8dnWAtf7C2 The Founders also treated headaches with leeches bark and opium so let's ditch the FDA. https://t.co/H2jI3AnwXc The founders often pooped in buckets. We've advanced as a society and can make decisions based on information from this century. https://t.co/WhnlOjdRkp the founders never intended for a dog to play basketball https://t.co/v9kTUaBKVf pic.twitter.com/F0kvNV2HQT Sir they also did not foresee the invention of the modern "Dorito." https://t.co/TwuuK3TwsG The founders never intended for Nick Foles to win a Super Bowl. https://t.co/WY0jX39yjp The founders never intended for video games to become reliant on an extractivist freemium model. The founders are disappointed in you. https://t.co/vZRD6JkZjT The founders never intended for one of two political parties to flirt with fascist autocracy while attempting to implement minority rule either. But here we are. https://t.co/2DPIm5AfCK the founders never authorized an air force either but here we are https://t.co/h32nZW1PAM
