L, Qanon and Antisemitism and Colorado Chiropractor Oh My, LightWarrior, 2021-04-30, I haven’t seen this covered anywhere else but an article by David Gilbert in Vice (www.vice.com) entitled “This CrossFit Chiropractor Is Secretly One of QAnon’s Leading Influencers” is about IET.  InevitableET has promoted just about every conspiracy theory out there.  And antisemitism is his most favored of all.  He’s been pretty careful about not being identified until now.  Gilbert writes that IET is Denver Chiropractor Craig Longley.  Longley moved to Colorado from Texas and is spewing his poison as far and wide as possible.  Last year he had more than 30000 followers before being booted from Twitter.  But that hasn’t stopped Longley.  He uses his chiropractic office to proselytize to any unwitting patients and employees that find their way into his office.  Now he’s looking to go public. Gilbert writes “And next month Longley will make his first public speaking appearance in what is shaping up to one of the biggest QAnon conferences to date—even though the organizer known as “QAnon John” denies that it’s a QAnon conference. The For God and Country Patriots’ Roundup event is taking place in a city-owned hotel in Dallas and will be attended by Rep. Louis Gohmert and Allen West the chair of the Texas GOP.” His professional website (www.tmpdenver.com) The Movement Project has already deleted any contact information.  Hmmm.  Perhaps he’s not so happy to be outed.
