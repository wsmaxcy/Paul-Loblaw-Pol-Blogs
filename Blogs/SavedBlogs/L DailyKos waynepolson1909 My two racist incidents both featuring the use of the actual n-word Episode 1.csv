L, My two racist incidents both featuring the use of the actual n-word: Episode 1, waynepolson1909, 2021-07-04, I propose to do a series of posts on what I call my two racist incidents. I'm just a more-or-less ordinary white guy. I know little about race and racism but I'm trained as an economist and a policy analyst so I may be able to provide some comments on issues related to race and racism in subsequent posts. Or maybe not let's wait and see.
