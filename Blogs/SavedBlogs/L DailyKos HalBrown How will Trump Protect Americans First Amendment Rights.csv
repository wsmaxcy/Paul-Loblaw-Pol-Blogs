L, How will Trump "Protect Americans' First Amendment Rights?", HalBrown, 2021-07-03, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” First Amendment Click to enlarge the real press release (without the golden toilet) above I think is is reasonable to assume that Trump’s announcement will be about his right to free speech and certainly not freedom of the press nor the right to peacefully assemble in protest. While some Trumpists are members of a cult with him as their messiah I don't think this would pass constitutional muster as a religion protected under the First Amendment.. then again... The announcement was tweeted by his spokesperson Liz Harrington since Trump has been suspended by Twitter and can’t tweet himself.  Trump was mocked on Twitter for announcing that he was going to protect our First Amendment rights. RawStory has some of the replies here. The lead-in acts for Trump’s announcement aren’t exactly A list stars. Linda McMahon is an American political executive former Trump administration official and former professional wrestling executive and performer. She served as the 25th administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017. Wikipedia. I guess her more famous husband Vince wasn’t available. At least people have heard of Linda McMahon but Trump is mining the D minus list when he comes up with Brooke Rollins.  Perhaps he couldn’t afford to pay Diamond and Silk who turned their YouTube worship of Trump into an opening act at Trump rallies. What will Trump announce on July 7th? He already failed dismally at having an actual website (see “So you don't have to click on it here are some screen grabs of Trump's new (now defunct) blog”). I see three possibilities. One: He will announce some kind of collaboration with Parler the most well known conservative alternative to Facebook.  Two: He will attempt a relaunch of his website which combines the features of his old Twitter page with his Facebook page.  For Trump the risk is that the more he publicizes whatever he intends to do on social media the more chance there is that if it fails the way his website did the more embarrassing publicity a second failure will get. A third possibility is that he will announce what he will announce a major First Amendment lawsuit against Twitter and Facebook which he will predict will be decided by the Supreme Court. The benefit of making this announcement for Trump is that he can just say it and do nothing. I can’t think of a fourth. Can you?
