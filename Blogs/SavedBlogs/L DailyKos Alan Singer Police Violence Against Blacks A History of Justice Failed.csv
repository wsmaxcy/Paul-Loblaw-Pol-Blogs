L, Police Violence Against Blacks A History of Justice Failed, Alan Singer, 2021-04-18, We are waiting for a jury verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. If you have been watching the trial you know the evidence against Chauvin is overwhelming and that his defense attorney hardly presented a credible case. It seems as if they are hoping at least one white juror will block a conviction. On-duty police officers are rarely charged with a serious crime especially with murder or manslaughter when they kill an African-American man or woman. Even when they are charged only about a third are convicted. None of the Louisville Kentucky police officers responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor faced criminal charges. Last summer a divided Rochester New York Grand Jury refused to indict three police officers with criminally negligent homicide after Daniel Prude a mentally ill Black man died in police custody. A video showed Mr. Prude lying facedown on the street naked handcuffed with a hood over his head. The Rochester medical examiner had ruled Mr. Prude’s death a homicide caused by asphyxiation. At the hearing a medical witness testified that “The decision to keep him on his stomach for that period of time was — was unreasonable and against police practice.” Mr. Prude should have been turned over so he could breathe.   Unfortunately criminal law permits police tremendous freedom to use deadly force based on their judgment and biases. After an incident police benevolent organizations and politicians rush to defend officers who kill unarmed Black civilians the legal system gives police the benefit of the doubt and juries especially white jurors believe their stories or the web of excuses presented by defense attorneys who transfer blame to the victim especially when it is a Black male victim. Every year armed police kill about 1000 people in the United States. Since 2005 only 121 police officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter for crimes they committed while on duty. Only 44 police officers have been convicted and usually it is for a lesser charge or with a reduced sentence. The police officer that killed Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri and the three police officers responsible for the death of Eric Garner in New York City were never placed on trial. The police officer that murdered 17-year old Laquan McDonald in Chicago was sentenced to only six years nine months in prison despite being being convicted of second-degree murder.  Since 2015 police officers have fatally shot at least 135 unarmed Black men and women. At least 75% of the officers were white. Many of these white police officers have been involved in two or more deadly shootings without facing any legal consequences. According a National Public Radio report about 60% of the shootings occurred in the U.S. South with over a quarter of them in Texas Georgia and Louisiana. In New York City records show that officers with multiple negative marks in their files were more than three times as likely to fire their gun as were other officers. Police violence against Black men is not new in the United States. In 1900 a police riot in the Tenderloin District in Manhattan shook the African American community and escalated into an international incident. Because many of the African American men being beaten by the police were immigrants from British Guiana they petitioned the British Consul in New York City for protection. In 1946 Isaac Woodard a decorated war veteran in uniform was removed from a public bus in South Carolina by police on false charges and beaten arrested and then blinded while in custody. The attack on Woodard was so outrageous that President Truman demanded an investigation. The local sheriff was put on trial but acquitted by an all-white jury. These events are credited with Truman supporting civil rights legislation and finally deciding to issue an executive order to desegregate the American military. But Black men in military uniforms are still at risk of police attack. This month a United States Army Second Lieutenant driving while Black was stopped in Virginia by police officers with their guns drawn. He was taunted threatened pepper-sprayed and pinned on the ground. Police reported that they pulled over the Black driver because the car did not have license plates. The car was newly purchased and there was a temporary plate taped in the rear window. The police did not arrest the driver and no charges were filed against him. Currently police violence is a leading cause of death for Black men between the age of 20 and 35 in the United States. Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police. Black people who are fatally shot by police are twice as likely to be unarmed as white people killed by police. In 1960 James Baldwin wrote that the police “represent the force of the white world and that world’s real intentions are simply for that world’s criminal profit and ease to keep the black man corralled up here in his place . . . None of the police commissioner’s men even with the best will in the world have any way of understanding the lives led by the people they swagger about in twos and threes controlling.”  In June 2020 after the murder of George Floyd the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned “the continuing racially discriminatory and violent practices perpetrated by law enforcement agencies against Africans and people of African descent” in the United States. It condemned structural racism in the American criminal justice system and established a commission to investigate American police practices. Not much has changed in the last sixty years.
