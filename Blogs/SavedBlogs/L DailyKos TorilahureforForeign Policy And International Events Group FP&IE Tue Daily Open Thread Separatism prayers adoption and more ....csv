Some end up in a very big mess like Yugoslavia which has not yet been fully resolved yet. Many separatist movements go through alternating periods of violent conflict and attempted peaceful resolutions. Some go through extended civil wars. Sudan for example split into Sudan and South Sudan which underwent severe civil war. On the other hand Basque and Catalan separatist movements have been violently supressed by government. Although in case of Catalan which on ocasions had flared into violent movements subsequent attempt at peaceful separation was violently suppressed even just recently. Similarly Kurdish movement which encompasses multiple current nation states. Then there are simmering movements which while not yet culminated in noticeable violence as yet still have the potential to do so. Rising separatist sentiments in Scotland and Wales various small scale movements in US moments in China/HongKong. We have mostly peaceful movements in Tibet although there was a small period of violence and attempt at resistance to forced integration with China. Nigeria has been struggling with survival not just in terms of current separatist movements but also a wider federation wide potential collapse. These are just a handful of examples from. Wiki has an article Lists of active separatist movements which is so big that it has been further divided into content based sublists. A separate List of historical separatist movements. Many long term movements have sometimes fizzled out somewhat or Although those might had had better success at smotther transition due to previous loosely federated unions. With all that in background Over at the Modern Diplomacy an exploration of how to address various separatist movements throughout the world there are plenty of them and looking into what global management structure might be needed to address them. Separatism factor: How should the world community react on separatist sentiments? The notion of separatism is not new: ethnic minorities have been struggling to gain independence in various regions around the world for ages. As the majority of the modern states is not ethnically homogeneous many have a potential of an arising struggle of independence of the minorities especially taking into consideration the rise of nationalism. This issue is indeed of a global scale as the separatist movements persist concerns not only underdeveloped and developing countries but developed as well again only proving that it can arise anywhere in the world. The separatist movements might be considered as an internal and external threat to peace at the same time as it affects many actors. It is of course the state where the separatist movement emerged as the minority is willing to gain independence from it violating the integrity of the state. However the neighboring countries fall under the blow too. As a result the separatist sentiments spread further putting at risk international peace and security as the struggle for independence might escalate into an armed conflict. The way the political and territorial landscape might change in the result of the separatism movements activity and states breakups has been already seen a couple decades earlier. The consequences of separatism sentiments are quite alarming and might lead not just to autonomy for the state: the events around 1990s show how drastically can the political landscape change not only of a state but of a region or the world as a whole. The dissolution of Yugoslavia and Kosovo’s demands for autonomy the split of Yugoslavia separation of the satellite states of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the USSR – these brought a big change in a system of international relations which was not made by peaceful means only (including violent conflict in certain cases). 📚⌨📙📒🌏 European Union: Long awaited strategy/policy document by Euopean Union on its stance regarding Indo-pacific is finally out. It is not as bombastic and aseertive as US Indo-China policy nevertheless due to US/EU relationships alignment of policies usually match up neatly as between the dominant power and satellite states. the policy/strategy has some  minor variations which show a glimmer of separation of policy alignments.  For those with not quite enough time for reading and parsing ten pages worth of rivetting (okay I understand some of you might think  these documents are mindnumbing and use too much closet jargon) over at The Diplomat a short and crisp and to the point numbered summary that is sufficient enough to allow you to fake having read the original. The EU’s Indo-Pacific Strategy in 10 points. Here is the first one to get you going. On April 19 the European Union adopted its long-awaited strategy for the Indo-Pacific formally the “EU Strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.” The 10-page-long Council Conclusions represent a balanced effort of the 27 European countries to formulate a common position in the evolving debate on the Indo-Pacific. Here are the 10 main takeaways: 1. Working with partners. As its title suggests the promotion of cooperation stands at the core of the EU’s approach to the Indo-Pacific. This applies not only to Europe’s long-standing friends and allies that share its values but also to cooperation with “third countries for mutual benefit” as well as enhancing cooperation within regional multilateral organizations such as ASEAN-centered mechanisms or those within the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process. Flexible and pragmatic cooperation is part of Brussels’ long-term effort to enhance its strategic autonomy and promote its interests in the region. 📙✒📒 Palestine: In the month of Ramadan over at the MEMO a reflection and a prayer A Palestinian prayer for Ramadan: May the voices of the oppressed be heard Covid-19 cases in occupied Palestine especially in the Gaza Strip have reached record highs largely due to the arrival of a greatly contagious coronavirus variant which was first identified in Britain. Gaza has always been vulnerable to the deadly pandemic. Under a hermetic Israeli-led blockade since 2006 the densely populated Gaza Strip lacks basic services like clean water electricity and even minimally-equipped hospitals. As such long before the coronavirus ravaged many parts of the world Palestinians in Gaza were dying as a result of easily treatable diseases such as diarrhoea salmonella and typhoid fever. Needless to say Gaza's cancer patients have little fighting chance as the besieged Strip is left without a whole host of life-saving medications. Many Palestinian cancer patients continue to cling to the hope that Israel's military authorities will allow them access to the better equipped Palestinian hospitals in the West Bank. But that too is occupied and alas all too often death arrives before the long-awaited Israeli permit does. The tragedy in Gaza — indeed in all of occupied Palestine — is long and painful. Still it ought not to be classified as another sad occasion that invokes much despair but little action. 📚✒📙📒🚰🌏 France-Tunisia: A sombre reflection on how a french intellectual got away with multiple child abuse (rape)  complicity of french media and need for adressing the causes a thoughtful opinion piece at Al Jazeera titled Reckoning with Foucault’s alleged sexual abuse of boys in Tunisia “Tunisia for me represented in some ways the chance to reinsert myself in the political debate. It wasn’t May of ’68 in France that changed me; it was March of ’68 in a third-world country.” This is how Michel Foucault a French philosopher described his time in Tunisia a country that welcomed him and offered him his first academic teaching position at the University of Tunis. Foucault the public figure and famous theorist of power and sexuality was indebted to Tunisia for his early transformative experiences. He was enthralled by the intensity of the intellectual debates he took part in and the radicalism of political activism against dehumanisation he witnessed during his stay in Tunis in the late 1960s. During the same time Foucault the private figure allegedly sexually abused Tunisian prepubescent children. 📚✒📙📒💫 China: While todays main news coverage is likely to focus on the speech by President of PRC just fresh Xi Jinping rebukes nations who ‘arrogantly instruct others and interfere’. While we wait for various interpretations that are likely to appear over the next couple days the article I would like to share today is this one at SCMP which is a part of their ongoing Xinxiang project bringing more aspects of region and politics to the readers. According to their own words the series is “nternational pressure against China over its Xinjiang policies has gained traction in recent months with China criticised over the treatment of Uygur Muslims in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. China has denied allegations of forced labour and detention. We look at the issues in this series.” (Now that i have finished sounding like a not particularly even adequate advertising agent  or SCMP). This reflects and shares experiences of education system that is bifurcated by the language medium of choice. Xinjiang’s ‘fourteenth ethnicity’ leave family language and culture for China’s opportunities When Nurzhan* was a young boy growing up in China’s far-western region of Xinjiang he remembers heated football matches in which he and his friends would butt heads with fellow ethnic Kazakh children. “The min kao min are much better at Kazakh language than us” Nurzhan said. 📙✒📒📱Cameroon-Germany: Over in Germany there were calls for more engagement in affairs in Cameroon. Given the rising conflcit between french and english speaking portions which align with respective former colonial powers some politicians sighing with relief at DW a piece covering Germany dodges mediating role in Cameroon's bloody conflict Germany's government has dodged calls to change its political stance towards Cameroon amid increased reports of instability armed conflict and human rights abuses in the central  African state. In reply to a questionnaire authored by members of the free-market liberal Free Democratic Party on Germany's contribution to facilitating stability in Cameroon the German government stated:  "The impetus for a sustainable peace process must come from Cameroon and cannot be provided by external actors." German aid According to Germany's Foreign Office the country "provides the largest amount of bilateral governmental development cooperation funding of all countries [over €100 million in the 2017-2019 period alone]." 📙✒📒🌈 Namibia-South Africa:  From Global Voices exploring experience of a gay couple and their story which has triggered a debate in this  A Namibian couple's battle to bring home twin daughters born via surrogacy The case has become a symbol of Namibia's LGBTQ+ community's struggle for equal rights A Namibian high court denied on April 19 travel documents to the infant twin daughters of a same-sex couple who were born in South Africa via surrogacy in March in the latest development of a case that has caused a nationwide debate on LGBTQ+ rights in Namibia. Phillip Lühl a Namibian citizen has been in Durban South Africa since the birth of his and his Mexican-born husband Guillermo Delgado's legal daughters Paula and Maya but has been unable to bring the babies home to Windhoek where the couple lives. The Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs has so far denied the newborn twins the documents necessary for them to travel to Namibia demanding Lühl undergo a DNA test in order to determine parentage. Lühl then took the Ministry to court arguing that its request for a DNA test contravenes both Nambinian and international law but had his petition denied. As the newspaper The Namibian reported on April 19 judge Thomas Masuku ruled that it would be “judicial overreach” to obligate the authorities to issue the travel documents to the two girls. 📚✒📙📒🌏 Uganda: An Op-Ed/letter which does not even need an introduction dealing with a topic that is equally applicable in all geography worldwide appeared in the Daily Monitor propounding Why we need to reconsider an afrocentric education Facts are told Africa is the wealthiest continent on the planet earth as most of the resources of the world are under her ground. Africa has the resources but has not been able to acquire the skill to make world to work for her. She is depicted as a hungry and poverty-stricken continent but potentially Africa has enough resources to survive! From the vast and expansive lands the fertile soils good climate the strong energetic and resilient people Africa has enough resources to compete and grow like any other continent.   Looking at the way things are there is something that Africa needs especially in her education system. Education on the continent needs to help people learn about who they are what resources they have and how they can use the resources available to them for their human development. It is such an education that starts from self-awareness and self-appreciation that can release creative juices that can respond to the needs of the continent. 📚✒📙📒🌏 Jamaica: An editorial and a long exploration of a question that will most likely resonate world over about Covid-19 Vaccine and responsibility/rights/duties of businesses and other organization. How to deal with people who refuse to take a Covid-vaccine. It asks that very Hamletian TO PUNISH OR NOT? TWO lawyers are of the view that there is nothing wrong with employers punishing employees who refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine.  But there is also a dissenting legal voice that the Jamaica Observer spoke to in respect of the situation. Attorney-at-law Gavin Goffe has asserted that employers are free to contract with respect to non-disciplinary measures where refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine is concerned. He said that for some job functions and roles to ensure efficiency vaccination is likely to be required. “There are going to be places right now that certain roles and jobs are only going to be allowed for people who are vaccinated. I know for instance many employers who are not going to allow their seniors over 60 years old who are the highest risk category to return to work unless they are vaccinated” he said. Though the COVID-19 vaccine is not mandatory Goffe said employers are free to say that they are only going to be hiring people who are vaccinated. “There's nothing wrong with that. You can say I am only going to be extending the contract – and a lot of people are fixed term contract – of people who are vaccinated. Nothing is wrong with that [or saying] I'm going to only be allowing entry into my premises of people who are vaccinated” he explained. Enjoy The day Other General Open Threads That Run In Daily Kos.
