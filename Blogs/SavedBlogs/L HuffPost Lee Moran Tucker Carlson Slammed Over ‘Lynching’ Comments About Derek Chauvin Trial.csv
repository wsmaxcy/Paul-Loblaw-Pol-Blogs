L, Tucker Carlson Slammed Over ‘Lynching’ Comments About Derek Chauvin Trial, Lee Moran, 2021-04-20, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Monday again sought to sow doubt about the circumstances surrounding George Floyd’s death. After closing arguments in the trial of Derek Chauvin the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing Floyd in May 2020 the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” personality accused the media of “lynching” Chauvin. Video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds has proved central to the case with the prosecution arguing Chauvin “knew what he was doing.” Chauvin’s defense however has claimed Floyd died as a result of underlying health conditions and the presence of drugs in his system. Carlson contended that most Americans “still cannot say with any specificity just how” Floyd died. “So the closing arguments are a chance to assess actual evidence in the case and you would think that would be good news ― more facts which we could always use” he continued. “But no said the media. Facts no longer matter not when BLM’s founding myth is at stake. Evidence only counts in countries that have due process something they are now telling us is an ugly relic of institutional racism.” “When unpopular people seem guilty you just go ahead and punish them that’s the new rule” Carlson added. “Years ago we called this lynching now we call it equity.” Watch the video here: Tucker Carlson claims the media is "lynching" Derek Chauvin pic.twitter.com/b99ZOyjAHZ Carlson faced swift backlash on Twitter for his comments. Other recent Carlson rants have downplayed the U.S. Capitol riot peddled white supremacist conspiracy theories and questioned COVID-19 vaccines. Tucker’s White Power Hour just keeps getting more and more explicit I guess he’s not even trying to disguise his racism any longer. @TuckerCarlson you need to answer for this analogy. It’s not only completely dismissive of the result of lynching; which coincidentally is the exact same result of the murder your boy Chavuin is accused of doing  which is fucking DEATH! NOT THE SAME you silver spoon  manchild https://t.co/NieSL4U5IQ
