L, Trump Sues Facebook Twitter For Enforcing Their Terms Of Service, Red Painter, 2021-07-07, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  The Former Guy (or whatever meaning you assign to TFG) and failed retired blogger from Florida is so angry at being silenced by the two major social media outlets that he has filed a lawsuit against them. Yes you heard that right. Whiny retiree's delicate feelings are hurt because social media finally had enough of his daily violations of Terms of Service (that he agreed to!) encouragements of violence and the approval of the INSURRECTION TO OVERTHROW THE DAMN GOVERNMENT. All before he started spreading The Big Lie. But muh freedums right?  The highlighted passage in this tweet is brilliant and pretty much nails it on the head: Wish more news orgs would adopt this mentality https://t.co/1jIaYl42NW pic.twitter.com/kGT5yUC31b ‚Äî Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) July 7 2021 Twitter had...thoughts. Hilarious ones. I didn't realize that I got my First Amendment rights from social media platforms. How did we exist as a country without Facebook and Twitter for 250 years? ‚Äî Leslieoo7 ‚ò†Ô∏è üá∫üá≤ (@Leslieoo7) July 7 2021 Trump lawyers know they will never need to produce any discovery because the case will be dismissed before an answer is filed. This lawsuit can only be about distraction and fundraising because it is not about the law. ‚Äî Barb McQuade (@BarbMcQuade) July 7 2021 I‚Äôve skimmed former guy‚Äôs complaint against Facebook and it‚Äôs every bit as stupid as you‚Äôd think it is. ‚Äî George Conway (@gtconway3d) July 7 2021 You would think that any prospective Trump attorneys would have heeded what has happened to Giuliani Powell Ellis and on and on. ‚Äî Katie S. Phang (@KatiePhang) July 7 2021 Trump claims he is filing a "class-action" lawsuit against social media companies for throwing him off their platforms.What exactly is the class?Presidents who lost re-election and then tried to overthrow American democracy to remain in power?That is a class of one. pic.twitter.com/i5uxvo2sYp ‚Äî S.V. D√°te (@svdate) July 7 2021 Social media companies need not worry about Donald Trump‚Äôs lawsuit. He and his legal team have sued us countless of times ‚Äî and we are still here making his life miserable. ‚Äî The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln) July 7 2021 Trump is suing FB & Twitter bc he‚Äôs afraid of the Jan 6 evidence. He‚Äôs kicked off those platforms for inciting the insurrection. He wants to hit back at them bc being banned contributes to the validation of his guilt. A lawsuit will further expose his role if he follows through. ‚Äî Tom Joseph (@TomJChicago) July 7 2021 We all know that the most serious lawyers in the world still have AOL emails.  Obviously Trump's lawsuit against Facebook and Twitter for censoring his posts is dumb and frivolous which you can conclude after reading the entire 44-page complaint or just after checking how many of his Very Serious Lawyers use their AOL email accounts https://t.co/bldN6MyIIv pic.twitter.com/XOqsXsa9vx ‚Äî Jay Willis (@jaywillis) July 7 2021 WHOOPSIE: Trump's Facebook lawsuit is filed in federal court in Florida. Facebook's terms of service requires that "any claim cause of action or dispute you have against us" be filed in federal court in northern California or San Mateo County state court. ‚Äî Brad Heath (@bradheath) July 7 2021 AND OF COURSE: How you know this is a unserious lawsuit: Trump is already fundraising off of it pic.twitter.com/Njq8VqHAdB ‚Äî Sam Stein (@samstein) July 7 2021 This lawsuit is going to go nowhere but if for some reason they do get to discovery Trump's deposition about his part in the planning and execution of the January 6th Insurrection will be priceless. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
