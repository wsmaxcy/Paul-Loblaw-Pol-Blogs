L, Contemporary Fiction Views: International Booker shortlist's range of books, bookgirlforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-04-27, The shortlist is out for this year's International Booker and features some decidedly different forms of fiction. One of the most intriguing is about physics and math and people who thrive on delving into the murkiest theories about them. When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamin Labatut is being teased as a "nonfiction" novel. It wouldn't be the first novel to feature real people and real-world events. After all there's an entire genre based on that. That is not the hook that drew my attention. Apparently the novel is filled with wild associations of discoveries both gruesome and elegant some made by evil people. It all boils down to a rivalry of ideas about quantum theory. I don't have to try to understand quantum theory or physics in general to be intrigued by the idea of an idea that doesn't make sense but which works. And which may or may not have been thoroughly and properly explained by those rivals. Erwin Schrödinger he of the cat and Werner Heisenberg he of the uncertainty principle and contributor to the Nazi atomic project (and inspiration for Walter White's alias) both may have or may not have been correct. To try to hold together ideas that both are and are not correct is a good way to describe the human condition. We are capable of growth and of refusing to give up antiquated notions. We are capable of great kindness and of horrific cruelty. We think we understand the answers when we may not have even asked the best question. When We Cease to Understand the World will be released in the U.S. in September. Also on the shortlist are: At Night All Blood is Black by David Diop about a Senegalese man fighting for the French in WWI The Dangers of Smoking in Bed by Mariana Enríquez Argentinian stories of teenagers witches and ghosts The Employees by Olga Ravn written as a series of witness statements concerning the Six-Thousand Ship objects taken on board and how they changed the human and humanoid crew (no current information about a U.S. publication date) In Memory of Memory by Maria Stepanova the story of how a Jewish family survived 20th century Russia woven together with essay fiction memoir travelogue and historical documents The War of the Poor by Éric Vuillard a historical novel about what happened with the Protestant Reformation turned authoritarian  TIME EST/EDT (LAST SUN OF THE MONTH) 7:30 AM You Can't Read That!    or Paul's Book Reviews
