L, Will Facebook allow Trump to post again? We'll find out Wednesday morning. What do you think?, Thomas Hailey Kloecker, 2021-05-04, What do you think? Tomorrow morning Wednesday Facebook announces if it will let Trump post again after banning him five months earlier. Zuckerberg said in early January  “We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are too great. Therefore we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.” The last sentence to me doesn't make sense. It says we are banning Trump indefinitely but then says well maybe after things settle down in say two weeks we'll let him be on Facebook again. Sounds very Zuckerbergian to me. Of course Zuckerberg would like Trump back on Facebook because that would mean more money for Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg. A Facebook independent oversight board has already decided yea or nay on Trump's returning not Mr. Zuckerberg. What do you think they've decided?
