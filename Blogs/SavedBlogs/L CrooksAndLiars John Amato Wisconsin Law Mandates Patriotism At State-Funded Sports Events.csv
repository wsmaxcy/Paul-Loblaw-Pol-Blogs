L, Wisconsin Law Mandates 'Patriotism' At State-Funded Sports Events, John Amato, 2021-05-13, The Wisconsin State Assembly voted to pass a bill that would require the national anthem to be played before sporting events in any venue that has received public funding. Rep. Tony Kurtz cried while defending his proposal. Fox and Friends hosted Kurtz to promote his fascist endeavor.  When asked by Will Cain why he singled out sporting events Rep Kurtz used some wartime metaphor but really gave no rational reason for this to happen at Packers games and not movie theaters.  Obviously his bill has to do with Colin Kaepernick so they have legislated away freedom by forcing Americans to participate in a "forced anthem."  You can tell the Fox and Friends' Will Cain wasn't totally behind this ludicrous idea that has been passed into law. Cain uses the "some people say" routine on the WI legislator and said people around spots always told him "Patriotism has to be a choice. I cannot be mandated. What do you say to that?" Rep. Tony Kurtz answered by giving his military resume and replied "Patriotism you're right it's something  each and everyone of us feel within us." He continued as if he was some sort of preacher "So when you play the anthem you just have the feeling that reaches your soul that we are one great nation." Republicans in state legislators and Congress are so lost and rudderless that they double down on jingoism and fascism wherever possible.  I'd like to see each Republican in the Wisconsin State Legislature stand up and recite the words to "The Star-Spangled Banner" from memory. pic.twitter.com/KSQ80pk34c â€” Frances Langum ðŸ§¶ (@bluegal) May 13 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
