L, The Easter from Hell and Aftermath, NightMist, 2021-04-21, I’ve been a bit quiet here lately.  That would be because some crazy came home to roost. On Easter we had part of our bubble visiting to have dinner and play board games.  A small gathering just a couple of people and then the phone rang.  It was my eldest hysterically phoning me from an ambulance while paramedics were trying to bag her to aid her breathing.  She had gone to the porch to pick up a food delivery had an asthmatic attack and her inhaler jammed.  She collapsed on the porch and barely managed to phone 911 before she passed out.  She was calling me because her developmentally disabled son my grandson was still in the apartment. We all but flew. When we got to the house it was crawling with police and fireman.  I’ve still no idea of why they sent so many for an ambulance call.  As many autistic kids at his end of the spectrum do Dear Grandson (here after referred to as DGS) had been running around the house naked as soon as his mother was out of sight.  They had gotten him into a pair of his mom’s jeans and put her winter coat on him and he was standing barefoot on the porch with them waiting for us.  My husband went up to find his shoes and I got to talk to the police after DGS flew down the steps and attached himself to me like he was glued.  They were concerned with the state of her apartment.  Well gosh you think maybe an autistic child (12 going on 13) in the headbanger part of the spectrum who has been cooped up for a year might have done a bit of damage to his surroundings?  You think maybe he might have freaked out a little after mom went to answer the door and didn’t come back?  I had to start by explaining that he wasn’t talking to them because he cannot talk and in fact point out that if they had looked there was a sticker notice for police and emergency responders on the window in the apartment door telling them that there was an autistic non-verbal child in the house that likely would not respond to verbal commands and may run away from them.  They asked about the neighbors I gave them chapter and verse on the harridan downstairs who doesn’t feel she should have to live in the same building as “a freaky little retard” and screams bangs on the ceiling and jacks her music up to 11 just to set DGS off in an effort to get them to move and the landlord who for some reason was in favor of the shrieker and decided that since Dear Daughter wasn’t moving out as fast as he would like quit doing repairs to encourage her along.  Of note when she moved in they made an arrangement whereby she would buy supplies and he would do repairs.  There is some $500-600 worth of supplies in the garage there that she has paid for and he has not used.  As she is not in arrears on her rent the odds of him getting an eviction even if it were allowed right now are minimal.  She knew that DGS would damage the place and made sure he knew as well.  She has lived there for seven years the crazy woman downstairs has been there for about 14 months.  It has progressed to the point where the idiot landlord is not even doing the repairs he alone is responsible for.  I recently found out that she has not had water in her sinks for a year and that at least two electrical outlets are are unusable because the cords on things get smoking hot if you plug into them.  I was in the process of beating down family arguments to get them moved in with us when this happened. (But Mom you were really sick.  Yes but now I’m not.  But what about Dear Brother? Our son is also non-verbal autistic but a much milder young man. That sort of thing.) Anyway the police said they were going to have to charge her with misdemeanor child endangerment.  Of course they did she is an impoverished single mother.   That is just how they roll regardless of the situation.  It might as well be a local law that poverty level and below single moms get charged with something if the police come to their house for anything.  They told me to bring her in the morning after the hospital released her and that way she could just go straight to arraignment and probably be home for lunch without seeing the inside of a cell. So I got dropped off at the hospital DGS went home with Dear Husband and one of our guests waited in the hospital parking lot for me.  Dear Daughter was a wreck.  I assured her that all was well and that she was not going back to that apartment to live anyway.  We found that they were going to keep her at least overnight pending some test results. We chatted a bit more while waiting for her to be moved.  Then the Attending came back in and told us that she had bronchitis he was phoning some prescriptions in to her pharmacy and she was being released.  We had barely processed our surprise when two of the cops I had spoken to came in.  They were obviously uncomfortable and actually apologized for having to do what they were going to do.  Apparently the night supervisor at the cop shop had decided that Dear Daughter had to be taken into custody right now.  My best guess I live outside of their jurisdiction and Night Supervisor got freaked at the thought of our girl possibly leaving jurisdiction prior to arraignment.  I am seriously annoyed at the hospital for what appears to be acting at police request instead of the patient’s best interest. So Dear Daughter went wheezing and weeping off to jail I went out to my ride who graciously agreed to take me to the pharmacy to get the prescriptions and then the police station to drop them off for her before taking me home.  Dear Daughter was arraigned the next morning and we fetched her home.  CPS is treating the case like an annoying joke the judge gave her an order to refrain from harm instead of a restraining order and the CPS worker informs us that that is indicative of a probable Adjudication in Contemplation of Dismissal (be good for a set period of time and all the legal stuff goes away) The public defender is very excited that the medicaid service coordinator for DGS has copies of all the receipts for building repair materials.  Apparently two sets of receipts one with a public servant makes lawyers dance. So here we are.  7 people in one small house 2 of them severely communications impaired and one of those prone to attempting to damage himself and his surroundings.  It is being a wild ride!  We are all saving our pennies and searching for grants and programs so Dear Daughter can get her very own house.  Hopefully not in town as the quieter surroundings and the ability to play out of doors without harassment is being very good for DGS.  Home ownership will open up most of the many grants available to families with disabled people to her and hopefully she will be able to do better.  Renters are much more limited in what they qualify for.  Yes we checked Habitat first thing.  At least the local chapter falls down badly when it comes to single caregiver’s of disabled people.  There are required volunteer hours for recipients and they will not budge on them nor will they permit anyone but the recipient to do those hours.  Believe me I’ve begged.  However the more we can get DGS outdoors the calmer he becomes.  He is kind of fascinated by the llama across the road a little nervous of the horses in my barn and loves gardening with me.  Planting things and helping them grow is just the ult for him.  So boy is he in the right place now!  We have added a sunflower house to our plans for this year and patch of garden just for him.   Dear Daughter is fretting because apparently she has the notion that it is somehow bad for a nearly 40 year old to move back in with her parents.  I simply told her Welcome to 2021!
