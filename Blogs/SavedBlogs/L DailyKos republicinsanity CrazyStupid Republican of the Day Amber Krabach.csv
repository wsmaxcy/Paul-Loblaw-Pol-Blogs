L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Amber Krabach, republicinsanity, 2021-07-01, Welcome to what is the 997th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling Amber Krabach  who was a 2018 and 2020 candidate for District 45 of the Washington  House of Representatives who is the latest Republican we’ve covered who  actively promoted of the Qanon conspiracy theory. She’s a little more  “extra” than the average loon though as she has ties to more dangerous militia/hate groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys.But alas Krabach like others of conspiratorial ilk cannot be content  with just one paranoid raving plot being undertaken to ramble about.  Behold in April of 2020 where she began making up a conspiracy theory  during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when the supply chain  was negatively impacted while simultaneously the public panicked and  began hoarding basic supplies like bottled water non-perishable food  and toilet paper. You see Amber’s local grocery store was temporarily  out of flour but she saw online that someone else was donating 3000  lbs. of flour to charity and then connected the dots to posit a conspiracy theory of an Antifa/communist plot to… hoard baking supplies.…hngh?Anyway in her second attempt at getting elected to the Washington state  legislature Amber Krabach fell far short getting just 33% of the vote  and losing by a two-to-one margin. We’re hoping her interest in flour  is the only whiteness she continues being dedicated to and those  militia ties don’t further radicalize her to become a truly toxic  presence.         One Year Ago July 1st 2020: Chris Collins (NY)… 2020 UpdateTwo Years Ago  July 1st 2019:  Chris Collins (NY)… 2019 Update    Three Years Ago  July 1st 2018:  Chris Collins (NY)… 2018 UpdateFour Years Ago  July 1st 2017:  Chris Collins (NY)… 2017 Update  Five Years Ago July 1st 2016:  Chris Collins (NY)…  2016 Update  Six Years Ago July 1st 2015:  Chris Collins (NY)… Original Profile
