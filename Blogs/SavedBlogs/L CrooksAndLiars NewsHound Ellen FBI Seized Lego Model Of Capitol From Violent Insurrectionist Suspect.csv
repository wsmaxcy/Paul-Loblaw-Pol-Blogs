L, FBI Seized Lego Model Of Capitol From Violent Insurrectionist Suspect, NewsHound Ellen, 2021-07-08, We need your help now more than ever.

When the FBI raided the home of one of the most disturbing January 6th insurrectionist suspects they seized a fully constructed Lego model of the U.S. Capitol among other pieces of damning evidence. The Smoking Gun has the chilling details about 27 year-old Robert Morss’ alleged activities on January 6th: Prosecutors charge that Robert Morss 27 directed fellow rioters during “one of the most intense and prolonged clashes” with law enforcement officers who were seeking to prevent a violent mob from entering the Capitol through doors on the Lower West Terrace. Morss wearing tactical gear and a “Make America Great Again” hat allegedly ripped a riot shield from the hands of a Metropolitan Police Department officer and later organized a “shield wall” that was used to “crush officers in the rioters’ path.” The evidence seized by the FBI was just as chilling. In addition to a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag and other items that matched what Morss was seen with on January 6th they collected a handgun a shotgun and rifle along with a notebook that included steps to create a hometown militia. It included a list of names equipment and steps such as “Battle Drills” “Ambush” and “Formations.” There were also notes such as “Bring Kit/Body Armor;” “Bring Assault Rife;” and “4 Magazines.” The FBI noted that “Law enforcement also recovered a fully constructed U.S. Capitol Lego set.” In other words this dude was not just caught up in a mob frenzy. He came with a goal of causing some serious damage. And he seems to have accomplished at least some of that mission. Smoking Gun also reported that Morss is a former Army Ranger who recently worked as a substitute teacher. But you can count on him not being included in any Fox News attacks on either the military or our school systems.  For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
