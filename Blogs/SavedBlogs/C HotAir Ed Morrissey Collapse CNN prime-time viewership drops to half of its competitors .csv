C, Collapse: CNN prime-time viewership drops to half of its competitors , Ed Morrissey, 2021-05-11, It’s only one day but what a day. The Hill’s Joe Concha took at look at the cable-news ratings for Friday and almost required a microscope to get CNN’s viewer data. Fox News led the way but MSNBC has managed to keep pace both in overall viewers and in the key advertising demographic of 25-54 year olds. CNN barely creates blip in comparison (via Twitchy): The drop CNN is experiencing is profound. On Friday not one program broke 900K total viewers. Prime averaged less than 800K overall.  For comparison the network averaged 2.74 million viewers in January so we're talking about more than two-thirds of the audience – gone. https://t.co/a4f14QXStm — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) May 10 2021  Mediaite breaks it down further: AC360 guest-hosted by CNN anchor John Berman averaged the fewest viewers at 8 p.m. on Friday with 753000 total and 133000 in the demo – down from Erin Burnett OutFront’s 782000 total viewers and 185000 in the demo. MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes saw 1.6 million total viewers and 216000 in the demo up from The ReidOut’s 1.31 million total viewers and 172000 in the demo at 7 p.m. Of course neither MSNBC nor CNN could top Fox News juggernaut Tucker Carlson Tonight which won not only the hour but the day with 2.66 million total viewers and 347000 in the demo a significant jump from Fox News Primetime’s 1.43 million total viewers and 219000 in the demo. … Fox News averaged the most viewers in total day with 1.35 million and also the most in the demo with 209000. MSNBC was second with 1.08 million total viewers and third in the demo with 138000. While CNN notched less than half of Fox’s viewers in total day with 649000 it was second in the demo with 163000. Fox News also won in prime time with 2.05 million total viewers and 270000 in the demo. MSNBC was second with 1.82 million total viewers and 227000 in the demo. CNN was a distant third in prime time with 799000 total viewers and 164000 in the demo. Fox and Friends won in the early morning averaging 1.14 million total viewers and 194000 in the demo. MSNBC’s Morning Joe was second with 945000 total viewers and 115000 in the demo. CNN’s New Day was third in total viewers with 503000 and second in the demo with 145000. This is one day but it’s in May — a month that used to be one of two “sweeps” months (the other was November). There aren’t any reruns in cable news and even if the doldrums of summer have become nearly as mythical as “sweeps month” in recent years those dog days have yet to arrive as well. CNN is at least a little more competitive in the demo than in overall viewers. Jake Tapper scores highest in the demo and manages to beat his MSNBC competition in both time blocks. Wolf Blitzer and Erin Burnett did the same although all three lagged well behind Fox in the demo. Anderson Cooper scores atrociously in that slice of the audience however and in prime time only Don Lemon outscores anyone — and that’s because Lawrence O’Donnell loses half of Rachel Maddow’s audience. This looks like a collapse and one specific to CNN. There was plenty of speculation that Donald Trump’s exit from office would kill cable news some of it from Trump himself but that hasn’t been the case. With a Democrat in the White House some thought that MSNBC would lose steam but they’re competitive with Fox which still dominates. The only outlet losing audiences is CNN. Perhaps this is a commentary on the lack of interest among viewers for lukewarm political takes. It could reflect talent issues in prime time as well especially Chris Cuomo and his sleazy propagandizing for his brother Andrew while getting favors from him. Whatever it is CNN and its AT&T corporate owners had better figure out the problem quickly before the channel fades into irrelevance. Update: Bear in mind that both Cooper and Lemon were off that night of which I was unaware when I wrote this post. That always impacts viewership even when a fill-in host replaces them.
