L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Brandon Martin- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-05-10, On This date one year ago “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” first profiled Brandon Martin who attempted unsuccessfully to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in Arizona’s  2nd Congressional District in 2018 losing in the GOP Primary for that seat by about 4000 votes.Martin is unflinchingly heartless in his fiscal conservative rhetoric outright saying he wants to end Social Security Medicare and Medicaid (those latter two in particular should be great issue stances for a winning political strategy to have in the middle of a pandemic right?What’s more what’s little that is known about his other issue positions includes the fact that he’s a Personhood supporter and he supports Donald Trump’s brainless idea for a border wall on the U.S./Mexico border.But if there’s one issue that brought Brandon Martin to our attention it’s his stance on guns. Not just that he’s opposed to gun control completely but it’s how he fundraises on that topic. In October of 2019 he sent out a fundraising e-mail loaded with as many gun metaphors as you could stack into a paragraph:             ”Ann Kirkpatrick sits on the Appropriations Committee. ($$ Big money donations $$) She’s going to have a war chest in November 2020. I need ’ammunition’ to remove her from office. Will you load me up with a donation of $5 $10 $25 or more so I can ’train my sights’ on Ann Kirkpatrick and remove her from office in 2020?“ Keep in mind the Congressional District that Martin wants to win office in is Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District also known as “Gabby Giffords district” where that Congresswoman was shot along with 17 people 6 of whom died in the attack and it happened after Sarah Palin was running ads that but a sniper’s target over it on a map online back in 2010.Brandon Martin gaslighted Rep. Kirkpatrick after she called him out on his attempts at getting cash (and/or a stochastic terrorist to carry out an assassination on his behalf) and tried pretending like everyone was reading into things too much. Yes he’s that much of a craven ***hole who’s trying to play coy when he knew exactly what he was doing. He ended up losing to her in November getting only 45% of the vote. We are unsure at this time if with Ann Kirkpatrick announcing she will retire at the end of this term if Brandon Martin will make a third attempt at getting elected in Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District but all we know is he fails again and gets a hat trick of electoral defeat.
