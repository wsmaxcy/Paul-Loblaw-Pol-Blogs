L, Rachel Maddow on Arizona Cyber Ninjas Re-Count, DeniseHa, 2021-04-23, Last night the inimitable Rachel Maddow had a segment on the Arizona recount giving a history that includes RWNJ Louie Gohmert’s Nov 12 2020 claim that a Spanish server in Germany switched Trump votes to Biden votes and Trump lawyer Sidney Powell led a CIA raid to recover the server resulting in a firefight in which five U.S. soldiers died… The above image shows what was supposedly on the Spanish server in Germany that Sidney Powell and her commandos were supposedly trying to recover before the CIA could disappear it. This image (“obtained by Dude on Twitter”) shows that Trump won “by a lot.” /s It’s laugh-out-loud funny except that the Trump crowd really seems to believe this BS.  A company called Cyber Ninjas actively promoted this nonsense. So guess who the Arizona GOP hired to do yet another recount of the AZ ballots? Why Cyber Ninjas of course. The ballots were dutifully turned over to the company for their re-count. Hmmm. Wonder what they’ll find. You can watch the segment here: www.msnbc.com/…  My fear is that Cyber Ninjas will try to somehow try to manipulate machine votes and/or switch actual paper ballots with forged paper ballots to get the results they want. If there are any shenanigans I want the entire book of election fraud laws thrown at them. It may be that there are security cameras documenting their every move. I hope there are. But the AZ recount by Cyber Ninjas seems to have Trump World super-excited.  As Maddow is wont to say “Watch this space.”  UPDATE: Listening to Chris Hayes tonight (4/23): the Cyber Ninja people are using with BLUE PENS (rather than the RED PENS they are supposed to use for marking ballots during audits because the machines read blue pens but not red pens) security is lax and the Cyber Ninja people are NOT letting reporters close enough to document what they’re doing. Meanwhile a AZ GOP rep opposes the proposed voter restriction laws because...get this...they’re NOT RESTRICTIVE ENOUGH!
