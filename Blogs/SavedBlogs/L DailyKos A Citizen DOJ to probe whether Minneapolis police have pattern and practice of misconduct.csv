L, DOJ to probe whether Minneapolis police have 'pattern and practice' of misconduct, A Citizen, 2021-04-21, Star Tribune - DOJ to probe whether Minneapolis police have 'pattern and practice' of misconduct The U.S. Department of Justice will conduct a sweeping investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a "pattern and practice" of illegal conduct according to a source familiar with the inquiry. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is expected to make the announcement Wednesday morning. The investigation coming one day after ex-officer Derek Chauvin's murder and manslaughter conviction will seek to establish whether the state's largest police department is engaging in practices that promote or allow systemic wrongdoing. Over the next several months the independent civil rights probe will bring Justice Department investigators inside the walls of the police department and out in the community to talk to potential victims.
