L, PA GOP Doubles Down On Trump's Big Lie By Resurrecting Voter ID Laws PA Supreme Court Ended In 2014, poopdogcomedy, 2021-06-28, Here’s what’s going on Pennsylvania: Facing a veto on their sweeping plan to overhaul state election laws Pennsylvania Republicans have set in motion a plan to circumvent the Democratic governor and create a mandatory voter ID requirement. They aim to do it via an amendment to the state constitution — a process that requires approval from the legislature and subsequent victory on a statewide ballot measure. Critics say it’s a technique that Republicans appear increasingly willing to use as they clash with Gov. Tom Wolf over highly politicized issues like voting and the pandemic. “The Republicans don’t want to go through the legislative process for their far-right whacky ideas because they know the governor will veto it” said Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia). “So now they’re just going to change the constitution.” GOP supporters of the tactic argue that approval by a majority of statewide voters would signal that an idea has merit. “If that’s a veto no matter what that’s why we have a constitutional amendment to let the voters decide. And they will ultimately make the final decision on whether there should be voter ID in Pennsylvania” said Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman (R-Centre). Still Democrats smell political gamesmanship. Hughes who strongly opposes the amendment and voted against it when it passed the state Senate this week has served in the chamber since 1994 and was a member of the House for several years before that — almost always in the minority party. He says he has seen a lot of procedural tricks during his time in Harrisburg but this strikes him as a new development. Constitutional amendments are relatively rare in Pennsylvania in large part because passing them is time-consuming. They have to be approved in identical form by the legislature in two consecutive two-year sessions then go to voters for a statewide referendum. This year though the GOP found success with this strategy. After Wolf struck down Republicans’ attempts to end the COVID-19 emergency declaration lawmakers approved two amendments that would give the legislature the power to more easily void those declarations. When voters approved them in the May election the GOP-controlled House and Senate promptly ended Pennsylvania’s remaining COVID-19 mitigation measures. “It’s clearly a pattern that has developed in the last year” Hughes said. “And where does it stop? If you take it to its end is it: We want to name some roads and bridges and we’re going to pass a constitutional amendment to call I-76 Joe Schmoe’s Highway?” In 2012 the Pennsylvania GOP legislature was able to pass voter ID laws when disgraced one term Governor Tom Corbett (R. PA) signed it into law. But two years later: In a strongly worded decision a state judge on Friday struck down Pennsylvania’s 2012 law requiring voters to produce a state-approved photo ID at the polls setting up a potential Supreme Court confrontation that could have implications for other such laws across the country. The judge Bernard L. McGinley of Commonwealth Court ruled that the law hampered the ability of hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians to cast their ballots with the burden falling most heavily on elderly disabled and low-income residents and that the state’s reason for the law — that it was needed to combat voter fraud — was not supported by the facts. “Voting laws are designed to assure a free and fair election” the judge wrote in his 103-page decision. “The voter ID law does not further this goal.” In addition Judge McGinley ruled the state’s $5 million campaign to explain the law had been full of misinformation that has never been corrected. He also said that the free IDs that were supposed to be made available to those without driver’s licenses or other approved photo identification were difficult and sometimes impossible to obtain. FYI the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court in 2014 had a Republican Majority and they voted this down. Like in other states State Republican Legislatures keep doubling down on Trump’s Big Lie. Here’s the Pennsylvania GOP’s top candidate for Governor: Dozens of people were in Harrisburg Saturday for what organizers called a victory celebration for the passage of two referendums limiting the governor’s emergency powers. One of the speakers State Senator Doug Mastriano spoke about wanting an audit of November’s election too. Mastriano recently returned from a trip to Arizona where Republican lawmakers organized an audit of their election. Though there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud he wants the same to happen in Pennsylvania. It started as a rally to celebrate limiting the governor’s power through two referendums on the ballot. “You do have a voice and you took the power back from the governor and from his dictatorial power here we had” Mastriano said. Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D. PA) who is very likely to run for Governor next year has been doing an excellent job hitting back at the Pennsylvania GOP’s propaganda: The people pushing the Big Lie aren’t fringe actors — they’re the modern Republican Party led by Donald Trump.We need truth-telling — and we need accountability. pic.twitter.com/KYMhm53BtV Next year is a huge election year in Pennsylvania not just because of the open U.S. Senate race but also because we need to hold onto the Governorship. Governor Tom Wolf (D. PA) has proven to be an effective fighter to stop the PA GOP from pushing through it’s bat shit agenda: Because Wolf's veto pen has frequently been the only thing to stop legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature from becoming law both major parties wonder what would happen if a Democrat wasn't in the governor's seat. “We know what would happen because of what Republicans have already tried to do” said J.J. Abbott executive director of Commonwealth Communications and former Wolf press secretary. “They would make it harder to vote roll back women’s rights and keep Pennsylvania near the bottom of the list for minimum wage.” Republicans say having their party lead the executive branch could help undo what they see as Wolf’s failed policies during the pandemic. “His legacy is that he locked Pennsylvanians in their home with his COVID-19 orders closed schools and tanked the state’s economy” said Charlie Gerow a Republican strategist and CEO of Quantum Communications in Harrisburg. “Pennsylvanians want change and they made that clear by voting in the primary to restrict the governor’s emergency powers.” A little more than half of Pennsylvania’s 2 million primary voters on May 18 chose to remove some of the governor’s authority in extending emergency orders. After the first 21 days the Legislature gets to decide whether to continue emergency declarations. Across the country 45 states – red and blue – are taking steps to curtail a governor’s executive power in emergencies according to the National Council of Legislatures. In Pennsylvania despite the pushback Wolf deserves high marks Rendell said. “He kept a lot of Pennsylvanians from contracting COVID-19. He did the temporarily unpopular thing but it was the right thing for Pennsylvania” he said. Rendell the former chair of the Democratic National Committee said Republicans are running against Wolf's pandemic record in state legislative races in 2020 and it might work in the 2022 Republican primary for governor. But it won't work in the 2022 general election when the term-limited Wolf is finishing his eight years in office Rendell said. "Republicans might need to run against Wolf to rally the Trump base in the primary but they are making a mistake if they do that in the general election" he said. So far the Republican candidate for governor with the most experience is Lou Barletta a former congressman and one of former President Donald Trump's first supporters in Pennsylvania. As a former Hazleton mayor he became known for his tough policies on illegal immigration. We have some huge elections for Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court and lower courts this year and we need to keep Democrats in charge of the Pennsylvania Courts and get ready for next year. First we need to keep the pressure on Democrats in the U.S. Senate to either eliminate or reform the filibuster to pass the For The People Act. FYI: The filibuster was not a part of the Founder’s original design. I was elected to serve the people not an arcane Senate procedure. If the choice comes down to the filibuster or democracy I know which side I'm on. Also the filibuster is already a campaign issue in the U.S. Senate race: It’s our democracy or the filibuster.  Yesterday made things really clear. ⁰⁰I believe the filibuster has to go. Short thread explaining why:  The filibuster has been used repeatedly to block civil rights legislation. It should be ended. I’m not open to changing my mind.  Right now PA Republicans are pushing baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud and attacking Pennsylvanians’ ability to cast a ballot. It’s absurd. It’s time for these attacks on voting rights to end and in the Senate I’ll take up that fight. Contact your Senate Democrat to let them know you support abolishing or changing the filibuster to protect voting rights. Click here.
