C, Would this have happened to someone harshly critical of Trump voters?, Dana Pico, 2020-11-16, Virginia Wesleyan University “unfriends” professor who lashed out at Biden voters. The obvious question is: how did his Facebook post get made public? From The Virginian-Pilot: By Joanne Kimberlin | November 16 2020 | 2:12 PM EST A Virginia Wesleyan University dean whose Facebook post caused an uproar has resigned according to a statement posted Monday by the university on its web site. Paul Ewell got into hot water when a private post on his Facebook page went public recently. The post asked anyone who voted for Joe Biden to “unfriend” Ewell then went on to call all Biden supporters “ignorant anti-American and anti-Christian” and accuse them of “corrupting” not only the election but “our youth … our country.” The university said Ewell has since apologized. VWU’s statement said Ewell resigned last week as dean of VWU’s Global Campus. On Monday the university said he also resigned from his position as a professor of management business and economics. This isn’t really a surprise. What would have been a surprise would have been a university professor being fired resigning from his position because he’d “asked anyone who voted for Joe Biden to ‘unfriend’ Ewell then went on to call all Biden supporters ‘ignorant anti-American and anti-Christian’ and accuse them of ‘corrupting’ not only the election but ‘our youth … our country.'” How was Dr Ewell’s Facebook post made public? The Portland (Maine) Press-Herald noted: His post was made on his personal Facebook page which has since been taken down. The page was set to “private” — open only to invited friends — but someone took a screenshot of the post and circulated it publicly on social media. In other words one of his “invited friends” decided to “unfriend” him in a way which cost Dr Ewell his job. Had I received a ‘private’ Facebook post from someone telling me that if I had voted for President Trump I was a terrible person and should unfriend him I would have done just that: unfriended him. But even though I can be an [insert slang term for the rectum here] I wouldn’t be [insert slang term for the rectum here] enough to do something to try to cost him his job. Because make no mistake about it the guy who made a private post public was trying to get him fired. Unless you are horribly unaware of the political climate these days you have to have heard of doxing and known why it is done. The person who did this to Dr Ewell is really the one who’s an [insert slang term for the rectum here]. I stated that Professor Ewell was fired even though he technically resigned. Stephanie Smaglo a VWU spokeswoman said that while the university “cannot speak to personnel matters this incident is being addressed through our internal processes and policies.” Yeah that’s a firing. He was given the option to resign rather than being fired; that’s just how these things work.
