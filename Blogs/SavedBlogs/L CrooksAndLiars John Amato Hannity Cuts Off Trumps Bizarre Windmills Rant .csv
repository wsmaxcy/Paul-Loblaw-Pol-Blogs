L, Hannity Cuts Off Trump's Bizarre 'Windmills' Rant , John Amato, 2021-06-17, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Donald Trump was supposed to be on Hannity Wednesday night to talk about Biden's meeting with Putin.   Why on Earth would Putin's Puppet want to highlight the differences between his bootlicking of the murderous Russian autocrat and Biden's expert staff assisted and genuine international diplomacy with a side of warning for the cybercriminal dictator? So Trump pivoted to his favorite bugaboo WINDMILLS.  "We're not going to be energy independent two months from now" he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre making windmills all over the place to ruin our land and kill our birds. They kill everything‚Äù said Mango Mussolini. Also:  wind turbines are ‚Äúnot good" because they only provide ‚Äúintermittent energy‚Äù and that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot going to power our great factories.‚Äù I guess the buffoon was talking about the big issues with ERCOT even in the summer heat and trying to blame wind turbines for the deaths suffered during the great freeze instead of the Republican-led state refusing to upgrade their power grid.  "It's not good it's not going to power our great factories" Trump said. At this point Hannity cut in to change the bizarre subject to bring the former guy back to reality. "What did you make of...." (Trump garbled) Hannity said "There was a question there is a question of whether Ukraine would join NATO." After listening to his latest grievances the right-wing The Daily Mail seems to have it right when it comes to the seditious ex: Gaunt and pale Trump appears exhausted as he visits Trump Tower in NYC for first time since allegations emerged that his DoJ 'spied' on congressman and even his own White House counsel https://t.co/tYELOsVWDH ‚Äî More science less quackery.
