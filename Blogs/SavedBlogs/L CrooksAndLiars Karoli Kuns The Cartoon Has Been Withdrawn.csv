L, The Cartoon Has Been Withdrawn, Karoli Kuns, 2021-03-30, March 31 2021: I published this cartoon with some reservations but ultimately chose to because I thought it still made a powerful point about the different ways the Black community is harmed.  Upon reflection and after reading the comments here and elsewhere I realize that decision was ill-advised. Despite the fact that the intent was to stand with everyone using the image of George Floyd was the wrong way to do it. I am going to remove this image and substitute one honoring George Floyd. I am not removing it because I want to hide from my editorial decision but out of respect for the Black community and the trauma they have suffered.  Please accept my sincere apologies for any harm this image caused. I can only promise to do better in the future.
