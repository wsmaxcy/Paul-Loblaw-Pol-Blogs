C, Thomas Sowell in Full, Steven Hayward, 2021-01-26, Jason Riley of the Manhattan Institute has completed his biography of Thomas Sowell and Maverick: A Biography of Thomas Sowell will appear in May (though by all means pre-order it now). In the meantime it really is worth finding a spare hour to take in this documentary about Sowell based on Jason’s book from our friends at Free to Choose media:    Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
