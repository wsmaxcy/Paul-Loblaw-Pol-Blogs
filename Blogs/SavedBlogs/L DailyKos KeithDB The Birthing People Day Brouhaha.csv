L, The Birthing People Day Brouhaha, KeithDB, 2021-05-09, Today's winner in the category of made up conservative angst is the claim that evil progressive libs are out to change the name of today from "Mother's Day" to "Birthing People Day."  Supposedly this is a huge sprawling nefarious liberal plot.  It's actually a plot of one and never had any suggestion of Mother's Day or changing the name of the annual celebration.    Three days ago Democratic Representative Cori Bush stated the following in a House Oversight Committee meeting:  “I sit before you today as a single mom as a nurse as an activist and as a congresswoman. And I am committed to doing the absolute most to protect Black mothers to protect Black babies to protect Black birthing people and to save lives.” All the right wing caterwauling about "Mother's Day" being changed to "Birthing People Day" is their own fabricated extrapolations from that quote.  That's it.  The quote had nothing to do with Mother's Day.  The words "mom" and "mothers" appears right in it so it's not as if Representative Bush was trying to expunge such words from our lexicon.  But the Tucker Carlsons and Ben Shapiros of the world did not let the reality of it stand in the way of their fear mongering hate rhetoric.    The liberal "conspiracy" of one person (Cori Bush) is actually a conspiracy of right wing demagogues creating a boogeyman out of dust.
