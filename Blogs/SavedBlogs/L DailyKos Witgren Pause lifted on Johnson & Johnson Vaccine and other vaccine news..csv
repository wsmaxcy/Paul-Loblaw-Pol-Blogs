L, Pause lifted on Johnson & Johnson Vaccine and other vaccine news., Witgren, 2021-04-23, I’m surprised I didn’t see any front page or even any rec list items that highlighted this because it’s a BFD. The CDC and FDA have jointly agreed to lift the pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after a review of the information available on rare blood clots that have occurred among a few recipients of the vaccine. A warning label about clotting will be added to the drug  Otherwise it will be offered for adults over 18 with no restrictions. In total after further review 15 cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) were discovered in the US among recipients of the vaccine resulting in 3 deaths. The clotting occurred mainly among young women aged 18-49 at a rate of about 7 cases per million. No known cases occurred in men and less than 1 per million among women over 50. So if you are concerned younger women may want to seek out one of the other vaccines. However it’s worth noting that by comparison it’s estimated that the COVID vaccine could prevent 12 deaths and 650 hospitalizations per million among women 18-49. In other words there may be a risk but the risk of COVID is the greater one. Unfortunately the damage may already be done and most people are not good at this kind of risk assessment. I suspect that while the J&J vaccine will be offered the enthusiasm for the one-and-done vaccine will be dampened. Still even if enthusiasm is dampened some people will get it and it will still be an increase in efforts to get people vaccinated.  In other vaccine news a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates COVID vaccines are perfectly safe for pregnant women. The study followed 35000 women aged 16-54 who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and found no indications of increased risk of side effects. Pregnancy is considered a high risk factor for COVID so this is good news indeed. There is also speculation that mother could pass antibodies on to the infant offering at least temporary protection to the newborn.  Novavax continues it’s Phase 3 trials but it now appears unlikely they’ll submit results and a request for an EUA in the US before at least mid-May. The Novavax vaccine will be another 2-dose vaccine (21 days apart) and would add another vaccine to the list of those available. Sadly there are increasing reports of areas in the US refusing or not using their full allotments of vaccine in areas with high levels of vaccine hesitancy so adding this new vaccine to the list in late May or June may just be too little too late in that respect. However globally it’s good news because there are still many countries lagging far far behind in vaccinations and one advantage of the Novavax vaccine is its stability — it doesn’t required the extreme cold temperatures to store and so will potentially be a good option for areas unable to provide the super-cold storage needed for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  Where are we at here in the US? The CDC vaccine tracker says that as of today 52.6% of adults 18 and over are at least partially vaccinated. 81% of adults 65 and over are at least partially vaccinated. Vaccination rates vary widely across the country however. For example Alabama has a vaccination rate of 49552 per 100000 adults compared to Connecticut which has a very impressive vaccination rate of 82944 per 100000 adults. The far NE states seem to be leading the way in vaccinating adults with multiple states (MA ME NH CN and VT) all topping more than 80000 vaccinated adults per 100k). We may get to see what herd immunity means in the NE first. Despite over half of US adults being vaccinated though we are still experiencing a disturbingly high level of cases and deaths. Our current 7-day average is far better than during the winter months; but worse than anytime before late October of last year.
