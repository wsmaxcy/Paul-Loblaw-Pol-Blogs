I’m trying hard to warn my garden about our 2021 Drought. I know a lot of watering-savings methods learned from my first major CA drought decades ago. I’m just bummed out having to use them to the nth degree every 5-10 years.  Ugh.  Of course in-between official droughts I maintain a number of simple water-saving strategies anyway out of um muscle memory.  But here at Rancho EJ we’re now cranking it up to eleven. Sigh. Please talk among yourselves.
