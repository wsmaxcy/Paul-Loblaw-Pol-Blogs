L, The People Conducting the Arizona Audit, KeithDB, 2021-05-10, See that picture of the man counting the ballots in the Republican Arizona Kangaroo Recount?  His name is Anthony Kern.  You can also see him in pictures with the mob storming the Capitol on January 6th.  Kern is a Republican former member of the Arizona Congress.  He is now auditing an election that he lost.  His name appears on the ballots he is “auditing” twice for the reelection he lost and as an elector for Donald Trump. So an elector for Trump is auditing his own failure to be appointed to the electoral college. In addition to being among the mob at the Capitol Kern was a big time proponent of "#StopTheSteal.”  He used that hashtag 17 times between November and January 6th on Twitter.  At 10 am on January 6th he tweeted: “D-Day in DC to support Arizona’s and America’s duly elected President Donald Trump! #StoptheSteal.”  Don't believe me?  He's proud of it and the tweet is still up.  D-Day in DC to support Arizona's and America's duly elected President Donald Trump! #StoptheSteal @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/IFEmBkBnjI  On January 4th this "auditor" tweeted: "Stop the Steal called for a January 6th protest. Now President Donald J. Trump is leading it."    Stop the Steal called for a January 6th protest. Now President Donald J. Trump is leading it. RSVP now! https://t.co/Fl0NTD2rYk  On January 1st this "auditor" tweeted: "Are you ready to #StopTheSteaI on #JAN6 in #DC to support @realDonaldTrump? Be there!"   Are you ready to #StopTheSteaI on #JAN6 in #DC to support @realDonaldTrump? Be there! pic.twitter.com/spgHPIIgEI  I could go on like this for quite some time but you get the idea.    When the picture of this "auditor" was released those conducting the audit took quick and decisive action.  They revoked the press credentials of the reporter who took the picture.
