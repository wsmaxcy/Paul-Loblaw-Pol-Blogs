In pretrial data turned over by Remington to nine Sandy Hook families who are suing them over their marketing practices lawyers reported 18000 cartoons and 15000 pictures of people go-karting and dirt-biking. Via the Connecticut Post:  “Having repeatedly represented to the (families) and this court that it was devoting extensive resources to making what it described as “substantial” document productions … Remington has instead made the plaintiffs wait years to receive cartoon images gender reveal videos and duplicate copies of catalogues” reads a complaint filed by the families’ lawyers in state Superior Court last week. “There is no possible reasonable explanation for this conduct.” The complaint the latest in the 7-year-battle by the Sandy Hook families to hold accountable the maker of the AR-15-style rifle used in the 2012 shootings does not allege that all 46000 documents turned over by Remington are irrelevant. “When the seemingly random cartoons images videos duplicates and other items noted are accounted for Remington it would seem has spent the better part of seven years producing 6606 potentially useful documents in response to the plaintiffs’ requests” the court complaint reads. Other images are simpler cartoons plus 1521 video files of gender reveal parties and the ice bucket challenge according to the complaint. The families’ lawyers say the company is trying to delay the case. pic.twitter.com/lYWrNRd75J — Connecticut Post (@connpost) July 7 2021 (Linked in article) Remington declared bankruptcy to avoid litigation.The Sandy Hook families suspect ... that (Remington’s) financial position has in fact been improving and that a desire to avoid continuing costs associated with litigating Sandy Hook wrongful death action https://t.co/C6ULrVrY7o — SureReality 🕳🏃🏾‍♂️🚶🏻🏃🏼‍♀️🚶🏾‍♀️🏃🏽🏃🏾‍♂️ (@SureReality) July 8 2021 Remington isn’t being asked to produce information to support the case for themselves.
