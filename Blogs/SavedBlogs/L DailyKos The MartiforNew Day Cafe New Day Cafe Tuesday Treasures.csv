L, New Day Cafe: Tuesday Treasures, The MartiforNew Day Cafe, 2021-07-06, Good Morning Cafe….have a cuppa while you join us for some treasures.     Some years ago there was an advert for the Chevy Tahoe.  It was a poem that was narrated by James Garner.  I’ve never forgotten it because it spoke to my love of wonderful places the wanderlust in my heart and a longing for “home.” Nobody Knows It But Me  There's a place that I travelWhen I want to roamAnd nobody knows it but meThe roads don't go thereAnd the signs stay homeAnd nobody knows it but meIt's far far awayAnd way way afarIt's over the moon and the seaAnd wherever you're goingThat's wherever you areAnd nobody knows it but me Today would’ve been my brother’s  birthday...he grew up thinking that all the Independence Day celebrations were for him and mum being a very wise woman didn’t tell him otherwise.  He eventually figured it out for himself but had a lovely bunch of memories to hold onto!
