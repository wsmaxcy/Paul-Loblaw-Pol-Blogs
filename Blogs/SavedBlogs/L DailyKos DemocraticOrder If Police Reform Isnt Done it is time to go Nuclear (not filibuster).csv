L, If Police Reform Isn't Done it is time to go Nuclear (not filibuster), DemocraticOrder, 2021-06-30, As a Democrat and a husband of a school teacher I am generally all for unions; however in many Republican states teachers can’t truly unionize and public employees can’t either. If Police Reform fails in the Senate it is time for states controlled by Democrats to make Police Unions illegal.   The Supreme Court is happy to strip away the rights of other unions so why are Democrats holding back against the Police Unions who have made it impossible to properly discipline cops or terminate them. The states Democrats control should also make it illegal for cities and towns to hire cops who have been terminated for cause.
