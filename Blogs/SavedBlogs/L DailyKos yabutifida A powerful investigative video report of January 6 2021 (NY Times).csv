L, A powerful investigative video report of January 6 2021 (NY Times), yabutifida, 2021-07-07, I have not seen this investigative report from The NY Times shared as a story or in a diary.  And I could be wrong.   It reflects the work of multiple journalist that have reviewed hours of footage from the attack of the Capitol on 1.06.2021.   It is about 40 minutes long but it is a powerful visual reminder of that day (it may also trigger some viewers so proceed with caution).   It is another truth and the reason the GOP continues to whitewash and lie about the events on that day.
