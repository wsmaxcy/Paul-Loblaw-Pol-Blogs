C, Biden Can’t Find His Mask, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-30, Poor Joe Biden a sad shell of a man who is thrown into a panic when he can’t find his mask–which was in his pocket all the while. But why is Biden wearing a mask speaking outdoors when he has been vaccinated? Why is he “in trouble” if he can’t come up with it? And observe how “Dr.” Jill rushes to help Joe find the missing mask. The man is barely functional. Also note the chaste elbow bump. Can we please never see this again?
