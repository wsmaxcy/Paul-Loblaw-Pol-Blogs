L, Anti-Vax Nuts "Natural News" Attack Dr. Peter Hotez, BlackSheep1, 2021-05-08,  Online trolls take anti-vaxx hate speech to a new level attacking Houston's Dr. Peter Hotez https://t.co/Tyr2dsvmbg  From the Houston Chronicle today comes an update to horror-show news I saw on Twitter earlier in the week. “Natural News” is a website which specializes in anti-vaccination and other reprehensible misinformation.  This week they turned their attention to Dr. Peter Hotez of the Baylor University Medical School. Dr. Hotez helped develop the SARS-2-COVID19 vaccines that have enabled the US to stop suffering more than 10000 daily deaths as President Joe Biden turned around our national policy on combating the virus. The website Natural News which promotes false conspiracy theories about 5G and Bill Gates posted a story about Hotez at the top of its website. “Echoing the fascism of genocidal maniacs like Hitler and Stalin” it said “Peter Hotez displays his own brand of insanity by equating vaccine skeptics with cyber criminals and nuclear terrorism.” The author Mike Adams called on his followers to “pray for this sad monster of a man” to “seek forgiveness for the crimes against humanity being committed by whatever twisted dark soul currently occupies his once-human body.” The story included Hotez’s contact information. Doxxing is a crime.  Dr. Hotez whom Adams compared to Mengele of the Nazi WWII regime is Jewish. Germany’s leaders have called for a ban on “Jewish Stars” at COVID vaccine demonstrations in the country.www.dw.com/…  Naturally the GOP fell right in line with the misinformation web-blasters: www.sun-sentinel.com/… as did “Tuckums”: www.cnn.com/... Here is what MSNBC’s “Deadline White House” host Nicole Wallace had to say on Twitter about the attacks mounted against Dr. Hotez by Natural News (and former CBS reporter Sheryl Atkisson who has apparently fallen off the anti-science cliff herself recently). Thank you @PeterHotez https://t.co/rhewFrwLb1
