L, Is Self Defense Promoting Violence?, TheGaikotsu, 2021-05-03, Have you ever been out in the school yard and the local bully came to harass you? The Bully starts with name calling then pushing and eventually starts hitting you.  Then you get fed up and hit back.  Finally when the dust settles and the teachers descend upon the incident and you are the one who gets in trouble. You learn that the behavior from the well-known Bully is expected but you….YOU…should have known better than to fight back. Fighting back is “fighting” and therefore you were in the wrong for trying to defend yourself. Explain to me how that is justice?What does that teach you? It suggests that you should just roll over and take it anytime you are threatened or attacked.  It’s no wonder that bullies thrive in this society.  We have given them every advantage. All they require is that you are either unable or unwilling to fight back. I mean no one wants to work hard at being a bully. You being so careful to be “passive” is how they target you and they seem to revel in the notion that you are essentially helpless. Interestingly and conversely it is discovered that if a person fights back against a bully the bully now leaves them alone. They’re no longer an easy target; they’re too much work.  They’ll think twice before they harass that person again. Sure after one fights back they now have a mark on their record but look what was accomplished? It was more than a 50 / 50 chance that just letting the bully beat them up while they curled up helpless on the ground would have still earned them scorn from Teachers and Administrators just for being associated in a fight. By allowing oneself to be auto-defeated a bully would know you’re an easy target and would simply keep harassing you because it’s double the fun. They get to hit you AND watch you get in trouble.  What do they have to lose they’re already a known quantity and are used to the negative attention and in most cases WANT that attention. So what really do you have to lose in fighting back?As a martial artist of over 30 years I am unable to accept the notion that fighting back is wrong.  I have a strong sense of justice and cannot handle seeing people be the victim over and over and over again because they no longer believe they have the simple and HUMAN right to defend themselves.Yes self-defense is violence.  It is violence against your attacker who chose to commit violence against you.  Making the assumption that by fighting back you will escalate more violence is not supported by Psychology reality or history.  It’s a propagandic taking point people have been taught and made to think it is the correct answer to the quandary. I have found that it is often used as an excuse to stop people from crawling up out of a hole they were pushed in. As if it were engineered to ensure the weak don’t challenge the strong.  In my decades of martial arts practice and practical use of self-defense in dangerous situations I learned a valuable lesson. When someone raises their fist to hit you you have three choices.1) Let them hit you.2) Block or evade.3) Hit them first (before their raised fist moves to hit you).For option 1 I don’t see how letting them hit you solves anything.  If they land one hit you can guarantee they will continue the barrage. You will be the one hurt maybe even killed. For option 2 it seems reasonable to get out of the way or blocking the attack but you have two problems. Once you begin to evade you will always be on the defensive.  How long can you keep it up before you are eventually hit or backed into a wall? Blocking carries the issue of “The biggest bone wins” and “the greatest force breaks.” Sometimes you can break your arm or hand trying to stop blunt force trauma. This is on top of being on the defensive while the attacks continue.  You are receiving defensive wounds. How long will that last? Option 3 seems too aggressive but you are no longer on the defense. The oppressor is now the victim you now have the advantage. You can either press the attack or find an exit and run away; the freedom is yours.  You weren’t the victim and you were given the option to choose. Yet folks consider option 3 to be “bad.”  Why?  Who set that rule? Violence will be placed upon you regardless therefore as an act of self-preservation it seems only fair that the option for self-defense be available.  You can say that people would abuse that.  People already do. Generally those abusers are the ones attacking you.Sure you shouldn’t HAVE to fight back but that’s a whole different discussion. People shouldn’t be murdered yet they are anyway.  Ethnic minorities deserve their day in court but are no longer given that right by the Police.  They are generally unable to live their lives in freedom due to only their skin color and they could be killed out in the open for little to no reason whether they comply or not or are just sitting in their living rooms watching TV or sitting in their parked car reading a book or fishing for their keys outside their house or going outback to take a phone call. The court system and laws are engineered to be against those of color. Is the solution just to accept that life sucks for them and move on? Is the option just to commiserate?  Is there is no room for discussing other options like self-defense? Is it that we are scared of ethnic minorities fighting back? It worked for them in the 60s.I also don’t think it’s in the best interest of politics and society in general to dismiss discussing self-defense as an option because some folks want to consider it “promoting violence”. In 30 years of witnessing people defend themselves and seeing how it stops the abuse being done to them is all the proof I need that self-defense is in fact a viable solution. Therefore it is a solution worthy of discussion and not cowardly dismissal. I believe the correct course of discussion is defining the boundaries of what is and what isn’t acceptable forms of self-defense and to whom you are allowed to defend yourself against and why.But hey go on and ban me or delete this dairy I am sure that’ll fix the problem.
