L, Awful writing + cheerleading + COVID-dismissiveness... Not. Good., Theodoric of York Medieval Liberal, 2021-04-25, Last night Jacksonville Florida hosted a UFC event at full capacity with no social distancing or mask requirements.  This seems to be part of Mayor Lenny Curry’s pandering to the MAGAts and “the virus is a hoax and even if it isn’t it’s behind us now” crowd and had some coverage from local media.  Celebrities attended and while Tom Brady was probably the biggest of the lot (though ex-NFL and Mets minor leaguer Tim Tebow is a very big deal in these parts) some minor ones like Megan Fox and some  other b-listers all maskless all packed together. One of the local media outlets covering this was WJXT-TV through its online venue News4Jax.com.  WJXT-TV is now an independent outlet that was for decades the area’s CBS affiliate until about 15 years ago or so.  It has deep roots going back to the dawn of television in the late 1940s and it has been considered a respected news outlet in the area.   So how did the venerable WJXT through its online presence cover this?  With this a piece entitled “’I don’t think it gets any better:’ UFC thrills sellout Jacksonville crowd plans to return”:   The piece is a monumentally bad piece of sports writing let alone journalism.  It is to sportswriting as The Shaggs' "My Pal Foot Foot" is to music or the cinematic oeuvre of McG is to movies.  It’s so bad that if it were a musical Franz Liebkind would’ve written it. Let’s get the elephant in the room out of the way first: the author mentions the pandemic once in passing: When the COVID-19 restrictions eased around the state and allowing venues to wipe away capacity restrictions the UFC came calling. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that he spoke with White during the pandemic and said that when it was safe to do it the promotion needed to make sure that its first event with a full crowd was held in Florida.  It was. And boy was it ever a night. White said that the UFC would be back to Jacksonville and expand its efforts in a state not known for landing marquee UFC fights. That’s it and it’s pretty dismissive to boot.  By contrast another local news outlet spent about half its article on the event addressing pandemic concerns.  Its piece may not have been Pulitzer material but it wasn’t laughable like this one. The sentence “And boy was it ever a night.” kind of sums up the rest of this wonder of modern prose.  We’re not only treated to who won what and the fact that a participant’s leg snapped during the proceedings but so much love for Dana White the UFC and how this was like V-E and V-J Days the day a cure for cancer is announced and the Second Coming all rolled into one: A packed crowd. Chants of Duval. Even more chants of USA. Stars and celebrities everywhere. A night that Jacksonville waited for was worth every bit of the wait. And it’s just getting started. …. Fast. Furious. What a night. The cherry on top this time — fans. The author holds the august title of “sports editor” with a major outlet in a city with a little less than 1 million population and that is big enough to have an NFL franchise and AAA baseball.  He sounded like he had just had the best sexual encounter of his life and needed a cigarette. The problem here isn’t just bad writing — he didn’t have to be Frank DeFord or John Updike writing about Ted Williams's last at bat and he’s far far away from those heights — but even more about how dismissive a big outlet in a decent-sized media market is dismissive of public health concerns and is more cheerleading than reportage.  I would’ve respected this piece more if it had just been a won/lost list than the gushing and fawning final product that ended up on the screen. No it’s not the “if it bleeds it leads” mindset that plagues TV news and that was so well outlined in the underrated film “Nightcrawler” from a few years back.  But corporate cheerleading with a chaser of dismissiveness about public health?  TV news and its internet outlets can and should do better.
