L, Eviction moratorium ending., duff1680, 2021-06-29, So I have'nt seen many diaries about the comingÂ eviction moratorium ending and the millions that will be homeless. I know in the last relief package there was a program to help them but I have'nt seen much if any press about it or how they could get it. So I have to ask other then the White House extending the CDC moratorium and a few people in congress pushing for monthly relief payments. What is congress doing about it? Full disclosure I don't rent but know many perople who do.
