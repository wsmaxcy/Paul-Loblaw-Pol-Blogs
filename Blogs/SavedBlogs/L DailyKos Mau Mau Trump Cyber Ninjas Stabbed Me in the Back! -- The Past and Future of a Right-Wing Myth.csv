L, Trump: "Cyber Ninjas Stabbed Me in the Back!" -- The Past and Future of a Right-Wing Myth, Mau Mau, 2021-04-23,  After Germany's defeat in 1918 reactionary forces upheld main claims of official war propaganda – among them the unsubstantiated notion that the German army had not been militarily defeated but "stabbed in the back" by the revolution. Among the identified culprits in this myth were democrats pacifists socialists or as in this anti-Semitic illustration Jews.Unknown artist: Der Dolchstoss title page Süddeutsche Monatshefte 7/21 Munich April 1924; source: Lebendiges Museum Online Deutsches Historisches Museum http://www.dhm.de/lemo/objekte/pict/dolch1/index.html.© Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin. This is the "Der Dolchstoss" all over again. Except in this instance the guy claiming to have been knifed in his back is Trump himself. At least Hitler made an effort to claim he was fighting for all the WWI soldiers who he wanted to believe had been stabbed in the back. They hadn’t been. Roots of the Dolchstoßlegende Above is a good link to an encyclopedia and you should check it out. This is one key factor in the rise and spread of Nazism after WWI. For what my opinion is worth I’d have to think this Cyber Ninja crap going on in Arizona is now a moot point. The ballots’ chain of custody has been broken with this red pen/blue pen nonsense. It should not be too difficult to have a court rule all the ballots are now spoiled and the previous certification of Biden will not be overturned there. PERIOD! It is just too ridiculous to believe this idiocy. That’s what any attorney worth his salt will argue. But this is about the Stabbed in the Back myth and if history repeats itself we’ll have another brush with fascism in the near future.  Kevin Baker wrote this article during another Republican presidency. It is behind the paywall at Harper’s but it is so good you can access the full article on his webpage. It is a recurring myth. Think of the myth of people spitting on returning vets from Vietnam and calling them baby killers. Some babies were killed. Tiger Force for instance. But I’d have to say more babies were killed than vets who actually got spat on and called a baby killer. I don’t know about you but I wouldn’t want to piss off a guy who just got back to the world after spending time in a free-fire zone.  I recommend Kevin’s article.

First drink hero from my horn: I spiced the draught well for you To waken your memory clearly So that the past shall not slip your mind! —Hagen to Siegfried Die Götterdämmerung  Every state must have its enemies.  Great powers must have especially monstrous foes.  Above all these foes must arise from within for national pride does not admit that a great nation can be defeated by any outside force.  That is why though its origins are elsewhere the stab in the back has become the sustaining myth of modern American nationalism.  Since the end of Word War II it has been the device by which the American right wing has both revitalized itself and repeatedly avoided responsibility for its own worst blunders.  Indeed the right has distilled its tale of betrayal into a formula:  advocate some momentarily popular but reckless policy.  Deny culpability when that policy is exposed as disastrous.  Blame the disaster on internal enemies who hate America.  Repeat always making sure to increase the number of internal enemies. As the United States staggers past the third anniversary of its misadventure in Iraq the dagger is already poised the myth is already being perpetuated.  To understand just how this strategy is likely to unfold—and why this time it may well fail—we must return to the birth of a legend. The stab in the back first gained currency in Germany as a means of explaining the nation’s stunning defeat in World War I.  It was field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg himself the leading German hero of the war who told the National Assembly “As an English general has very truly said the German army was ‘stabbed in the back.’”
