L, Ted Cruz Is Mocked For Jason Bourne Reference To CIA Recruiting Video, Ron Dicker, 2021-05-04, A CIA recruitment video promoting diversity prompted Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to reference fictional agent Jason Bourne in his criticism of the clip. So Twitter users spied an opportunity to pile onto the controversial lawmaker. The video focusing on a Latina officer in the agency was posted to the CIA’s Twitter account last week and has been making the rounds on social media. It has drawn criticism for perhaps trying too hard to portray its subject as both exceptional and ordinary.   #WednesdayWisdom"I am unapologetically me. I want you to be unapologetically you whoever you are. Whether you work at #CIA or anywhere else in the world. Command your space. Mija you are worth it." Cruz’s lame putdown became internet fodder. “If you’re a Chinese communist or an Iranian Mullah or Kim Jong Un...would this scare you? We’ve come a long way from Jason Bourne” wrote Cruz who has spent a lot of energy lately shouting the right-wing catchwords “cancel culture” and “woke.” If you’re a Chinese communist or an Iranian Mullah or Kim Jong Un...would this scare you?We’ve come a long way from Jason Bourne. https://t.co/HW8Eh9UdXa Twitter scorched the controversial lawmaker for using the fictional Bourne a spy from the Robert Ludlum books who was played by Matt Damon in several movies to address real-world issues. “Hey moron: “Jason Bourne” is imaginary ― like your conscience” commentator Keith Olbermann wrote. Others on Twitter also burned the senator. 1) Jason Bourne is a fictional character2) The president you shilled for is Kim Jong Un’s best buddy and said they ‘fell in love’ https://t.co/0iRzm57Hqf Jason Bourne is fictional as well as James Bond in case you are wondering. https://t.co/a2VGDpPcxe Hey moron: “Jason Bourne” is imaginary - like your conscience https://t.co/lAfPbP7RAl You know Jason Bourne is fictional right? The CIA has to recruit real people.Resign. If a secret agent scares the people they are trying to spy on isn't that counterproductive Senator?(Jason Bourne is fiction btw.) It's not supposed to "scare" anyone Ted.  But it sure sounds like it scares the hell out of you.Also Jason Bourne is a fictional character from a movie.  It other words not real Ted. Dumbass conservatives don't realize the CIA has valued diversity hires for much longer than other agencies have for precisely the reason that people in many hostile countries don't look speak or act like the average American. *Matt Damon to Ted Cruz when Ted brings up Jason Bourne: pic.twitter.com/etcP1Zos7H Man Jack Ryan is gonna be pissed when he finds out Cruz picked Jason Bourne instead of him... https://t.co/qYY4L8a4tG LMAO Ted Cruz using Jason Bourne as a reason the CIA was good? The books and movies are about how it tore a man to shreds and stripped his humanity then kidnapped and almost killed his wife!
