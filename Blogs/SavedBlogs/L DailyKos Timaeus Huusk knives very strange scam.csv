L, Huusk knives: very strange scam, Timaeus, 2021-07-03, Japanese knives and swords have been famous for a thousand years.  Recently I was inundated by Internet ads for a super-duper knife from “Huusk Japan.”  The ads were impressive and the price was reasonable ($40 with shipping) so I ordered one for my wife’s birthday.  I almost NEVER order from Internet ads! The company’s website says many things to suggest the knife is made in Japan from Samarai steel and they claim it requires Japanese master craftsmen to work for hundreds of steps for each knife.  The website has a picture of a Japanese master craftsman sitting on the floor hammering away on a knife.  When the knife finally arrived the box is covered with Japanese symbols. After delays in delivery of the knife I investigated more and learned that the company Huusk Japan is situated in Kaunas Lithuania!  WTF.  More research showed that the knife is actually made in a factory in central China and when we eventually did get the knife the package said “Made In China.” It’s an extremely good knife and we’re very happy to have it. But what’s up with this Japan-China-Lithuania-US stuff
