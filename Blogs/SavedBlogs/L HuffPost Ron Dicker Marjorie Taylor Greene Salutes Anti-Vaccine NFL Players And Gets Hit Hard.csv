L, Marjorie Taylor Greene Salutes Anti-Vaccine NFL Players And Gets Hit Hard, Ron Dicker, 2021-06-24, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) took a page out of the right-wing playbook Wednesday and praised NFL players who refuse to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. “Shoutout to the brave @NFL players who are standing their ground in their workplace refusing to take the #COVID19 vaccine that is NOT FDA approved” she wrote. “Athletes are not in the risk group & shouldn’t be discriminated against for trusting their immune systems.”  Shoutout to the brave @NFL players who are standing their ground in their workplace refusing to take the #COVID19 vaccine that is NOT FDA approved.Athletes are not in the risk group & shouldn’t be discriminated against for trusting their immune systems.#WeWillNotComplyAct Though no coronavirus vaccine has full Food and Drug Administration approval several have emergency use authorizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all adults get vaccinated.  Carolina Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold and Buffalo Bills receiver Cole Beasley are among players who have declared they aren’t vaccinated. Beasley’s defiant tone objecting to continued restrictions on unvaccinated players caused a lot of head-scratching. In a lengthy post he suggested he would build immunity on his own by eating better and drinking water. “I’m not going to take meds for a leg that isn’t broken” he said adding: “I may die of COVID but I’d rather die actually living.” More than half of NFL players have had at least one shot according to The Washington Post. The Colts Jaguars Cardinals and Chargers are among the teams with the lowest vaccination rates. Greene a noted conspiracist who’s intent on getting Dr. Anthony Fauci ousted from his Biden administration post got piled on by Twitter.  You have an odd definition of bravery. Risking one's health and the health of teammates coaches and staff is selfish. Can only imagine what all you said about this behind closed doors pic.twitter.com/2maLDcYrhj The NFL and NFL Players Association are encouraging but not mandating players to get vaccinated.They will have to follow covid protocols should they opt out of vaccination.There is no controversy here. You got nothin' pic.twitter.com/eAhCQWvHVl Ya so brave risking their lives and their teammates lives to own the libs. I'm sure their owners are super  stoked.It's not like there's millions of dollars on the line or anything. Absolutely as we have seen how well your immune system works against Polio or Small Pox etc. Delta variant is gonna love you. Too bad it can't vote. Yes - kudos for them for taking part in your big Darwin experiment. My body my choice right?!!!!  pic.twitter.com/Rx2PlpUgck Well then they should form their own little league just for themselves then. They trust science and medicine to fix injuries..but just not about this one thing. Gotcha. I’m concerned this tweet isn’t going to age well Imagine fighting this hard to avoid doctor’s advice to get vaccinated. Yeah! And don't forget those brave #NFL players standing err kneeling their ground in their workplace to bring attention to other societal issues.These athletes shouldn't be discriminated against for using their first amendment rights . Funny how some eat hot dogs and bologna most of their lives but won't get the vaccine because they don't know what's in it It’s got emergency fda approval and volumes of information showing it’s efficacy numbnuts A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus
