L, People Are Very Puzzled By Eric Trump’s ‘Pathetic' Second Gentleman Tweet, Lee Moran, 2021-05-07, Eric Trump tried to make some kind of point on Thursday when he shared a tweet about unsubscribing from the email list of Douglas Emhoff the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris. Ex-President Donald Trump’s son shared what appeared to be a screenshot showing a successful unsubscribe. Checked was a box explaining it was because “the emails are inappropriate.” “Second Gentleman” — the formal moniker for Emhoff — was underlined. Trump captioned his post with the #unsubscribe hashtag. #Unsubscribe pic.twitter.com/BCkTWgfVxQ The provenance of the photo is unknown.
