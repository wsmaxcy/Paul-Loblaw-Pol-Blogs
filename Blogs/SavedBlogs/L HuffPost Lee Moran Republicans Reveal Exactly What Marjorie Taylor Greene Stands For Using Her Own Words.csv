L, Republicans Reveal Exactly What Marjorie Taylor Greene Stands For Using Her Own Words, Lee Moran, 2021-04-08, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) receives a scathing reminder of her past comments in an anti-Trump GOP group’s new attack ad. The Republican Accountability Project uses footage of the conspiracy theory-endorsing Georgia Republican to show exactly what she stands for — including the harassment of school mass shooting survivors and the endorsement of violence to overturn Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat. “Because of all the immoral un-American things Marjorie Taylor Greene stands for we don’t stand with her” the ad narrator says of Greene a first-term Trump sycophant. Watch the video here: The release of the 57-second spot follows Greene’s claim to have raised $3.2 million in her first three months even though she called herself on Twitter “the most attacked freshman member of Congress in history.” The spot is slated to air on Fox News in Greene’s district next week according to the group which is part of the never-Trump conservative organization Defending Democracy Together.
