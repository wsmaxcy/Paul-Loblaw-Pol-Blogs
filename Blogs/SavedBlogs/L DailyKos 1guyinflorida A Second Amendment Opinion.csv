L, A Second Amendment Opinion, 1guyinflorida, 2021-05-03, The Second Amendment was penned by James Madison in 1787 and states “ A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed” are words that have long been debated as to their meaning.  There is a definite conflict over the rights of those who say they have a God given right to own guns and the need for a society a community and nation to have laws and good order and provide for the security of the same.  A gun does not impart knowledge on the laws and/or justice.  It does give many the sense that the weight of the gun gives them power and right to enforce their own view.  This seems to be the stated view of many perpetrators of mass casualty events school shootings and acts of insurrection.   We are no longer a nation in the throes of birth as we were when these words were penned.  We do not have foreign forces invading our shores hamlets villages towns and cities.  We now have effective and well-organized local police forces backed up by state and federal law enforcement agencies.  Beyond that a well-organized and trained National Guard under the direction of the Governor of each state.  We as a culture do not hunt for daily sustenance as we did when the Nation was being formed and organized.  We have codified laws and legislation and a judicial system that provides for the security of the citizenry and community on a societal level as well as provide for conflict resolution and security at all levels.  So what is the purpose of the Second Amendment in the modern era? In the final analysis what does the Second Amendment really guarantee?  That those who have the guns have the right to govern.  Donald Trump’s own statements on August 10 2016 would reinforce this view when talking about Hillary Clinton “If she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks although the second amendment people maybe there is”.  That there is no need for an expensive knowledgeable and powerful judiciary when any resolution can be solved with a bullet and a piece of rope which was the view of Chip Roy the Representative from Texas when he ranted “There’s old saying in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree.  You know we take justice very seriously and we ought to do that.  Round up the bad guys” what a great solution to any conflict resolution especially if I have a gun and you don’t.  So who determines who is the good guy and who is the bad? The Second Amendment seems to support right to rule by rabble as exemplified on January 6 when a gathering of insurrectionist stormed the capitol building and then chanted to hang the current Vice President but they could have just as easily stormed the steps of the Supreme Court which may figure into the equation as they debate the Second Amendment issues during their next session. What are the implications of the Second Amendment?  In the modern era it presents a direct path to chaos and anarchy for this nation.  We already have armed groups running around the country trying to take control of certain areas how long will it be before these groups are demanding tolls to travel in certain areas and killing indiscriminately because certain people do not align with them as they do in Iraq in Lebanon Afghanistan.  An example of these groups in America is the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville VA in 2017 where Nazi flags were flown and chants of “Jews will not replace us” then killing Heather Heyer for holding beliefs opposed to white supremacy.   How about the Bundy standoff where an armed right-wing extremist group seized federal protected wildlife refuge in 2016.  The Waco siege in 1993  the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma.  We will continue to see these actions as long as there is a Second Amendment that these groups can rally over. When the Constitution was written there was no mention of automobiles airplanes spaceships space stations there was no regulations on the environment nor the myriad of other regulations that now exist.  They exist because certain items can cause death and injury.  The ban on smoking was brought because it presented a danger to those in its proximity not just to those who actively engage in it.  The licensing of operators of equipment’s are requirement automobiles pilots crane operators are required because of the destruction death and injury they can cause.  We can see this with guns when you take into consideration the 2020 attack during a music concert on the Las Vegas strip.  Had the 58 people killed and 400 injured been done with any other equipment there wound have been an intensive investigation and more regulation and or licensing. My first rifle was an M-16 and the first order was to learn to maintain it and secure it before I learned to fire it.  I am a gun owner my family members have guns.  I felt that there are too many out there that present a clear and present danger to myself and friends and family I wish that such was not the case.  I am not a hunter but I do agree with President Biden that deer are not wearing Kevlar so you don’t need an assault gun to hunt them (have you seen what an assault rifle does to meat?)  To my understanding this is the view of many hunters and sports shooters.  Sports shooters celebrate their ability to achieve a precise shot and a precise shot for a hunter means more meat or a return on their investment and time that hunting takes.  Assault weapons allow for a spray of bullets in a general direction causing injury death and destruction with no consequence yet a painter causing overspray on to someone’s property then there is grounds for legal action. The NRA has been the biggest proponent of the Second Amendment echoing a belief that gun ownership is a god-given right and no condition must be allowed to impact it.  Pushing even the right to own every category of weapon to include those of war.  How about if I strapped a claymore mine to my ring camera for my personal and property defense you could stop the porch pirates in their tracks and it would definitely discourage the Mormons or the Jehova’s Witnesses. The Supreme Court says it will take up the issues with the Second Amendment during its upcoming session and this discussion has long been overdue.  If we are to remain a nation dedicated to the rule of law equality and opportunity a review of gun rights must be done.  We authorize our government to enact and enforce rules and regulations for the good of all it’s citizens through our votes and through our oaths.  We recognize and give our sworn law enforcement officers the right to carry weapons because they know and enforce laws in place.  Should we not require of the citizenry to know not only the rights but also the responsibility of gun ownership? As a postscript there was a shooting today in a Wisconsin casino where three people were killed and according to news reports when the intended victim was not present so the gunman shot friends of the intended victim.  No court no attorneys no negotiators no bargaining the gun provided the only conflict resolution.
