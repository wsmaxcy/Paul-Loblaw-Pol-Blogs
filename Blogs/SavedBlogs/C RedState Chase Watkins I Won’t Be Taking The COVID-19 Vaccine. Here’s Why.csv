C, I Won’t Be Taking The COVID-19 Vaccine. Here’s Why, Chase Watkins, 2021-01-04, From adverse anecdotal experiences to absence of real historical data to untrustworthy doctors the COVID-19 vaccine just doesn’t feel safe to me. I hate being called an anti-vaxxer mostly because it’s not true—I’m fiercely pro-vaccine but only for those inoculations that are safe and effective and that I’m able to confirm through my own research. This is my main problem with the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that have come out or are on their way out: no historical data. Most primary vaccines have been out for a very long time and for good reason—they work incredibly well and are extremely safe. The MMR DTaP polio varicella (chickenpox) and smallpox vaccines are great examples of this. Using historical and current data we can determine that: 1) as soon as a vaccine was introduced for a communicable disease the case numbers and deaths started falling precipitously; 2) as soon as vaccination rates drop—whether due to misinformation complacency or a false sense of security—case numbers start rising again and deaths usually follow. I don’t trust the medical establishment and the so-called “experts” that lead it either and this distrust has only been exaggerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance why did Dr. Anthony Fauci our top national infectious disease expert tell Americans not to wear masks early on in the pandemic? Not because medical data supported the claim or because masks don’t work but because he wanted to make sure health care workers had access to the potentially lifesaving piece of equipment. In a nutshell Fauci was afraid of the American people panicking. Instead of telling us the truth calmly explaining the situation and asking us to save the medical supplies—like any good leader would do—Fauci was willing to let us die. Forgive me if I don’t trust the Fauci and his fellow “experts” after that unforgivable lie. Additionally medical “experts” and politicians are now literally recommending race be used to determine who should get the vaccine first. The medical establishment is trying to distribute the vaccine by purely racist means. Even if the medical treatment does work and is safe it’s a morally reprehensible decision to judge people based on their skin color (not to mention going against Martin Luther King Jr.’s Dream) and makes me trust the medical establishment even less than I did before. To make matters worse the only data we have on these vaccines isn’t complete. Pregnant women and people with a history of allergic reactions reportedly weren’t included in the COVID-19 vaccine trial studies. Additionally in the trial studies for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna several participants developed Bell’s palsy after getting injected with the respective company’s vaccine. It’s also worth mentioning that the COVID-19 vaccines have been speedily completed actually setting records. Before 2020 the fastest vaccine ever created was the mumps inoculation in the 1960s—and it took four years.  The vaccines have been green-lit but the adverse anecdotal experiences of those who are taking the shots aren’t exactly reassuring. Indeed a Tennessee nurse passed out ten minutes after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine. Meanwhile two health care workers in Alaska (out of the 144 reportedly vaccinated that day) suffered severe allergic reactions to the same vaccine even though neither of the individuals had a history of allergies. All of this is having an effect too. Only 63% of health care workers say they’ll receive the COVID-19 vaccine a shockingly low number especially because we’re talking about people who work in the medical system. The one upside here I guess is that the CDC keeps a very close eye on adverse effects caused by vaccines. For instance in 1999 the CDC withdrew the rotavirus vaccine after just 15 cases of intussusception were reported among infants inoculated with the shot. But regardless of their attentiveness to adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 vaccine I for one don’t want to be another member of a glorified immunization trial. An untrustworthy medical establishment rushed vaccine incomplete trials adverse anecdotal side effects and absence of historical data are all good reasons to opt-out of a vaccine but put all those factors together and that’s a recipe for disaster not many want to touch let alone put in their body.
