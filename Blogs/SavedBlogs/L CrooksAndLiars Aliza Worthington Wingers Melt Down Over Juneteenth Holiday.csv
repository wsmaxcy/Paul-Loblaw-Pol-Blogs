L, Wingers Melt Down Over Juneteenth Holiday, Aliza Worthington, 2021-06-17, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Certain white people are bigly mad that President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday.  Witness this absurdity from Charlie Kirk: Lincoln knew America‚Äôs founding was July 4 1776. He knew that was the day our amazing nation made a step from ‚Äúideal‚Äù to reality‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù is an affront to the unity of July 4th. We now have 2 summer holidays‚Äîand one of them based on raceShame on the GOP for supporting this ‚Äî Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) June 17 2021 How quickly he forgets: this you? https://t.co/JCRzPixNe5 pic.twitter.com/dtzRVjZ6cV ‚Äî Jay Bullock MurderBot Stan (@folkbum) June 17 2021 The move to make this federal holiday official proceeded from proposal to signing in three days and with near unanimity from Republican lawmakers. That's enraging to Kirk. Here's one of the fifteen GKKKP members of Congress who voted against it: Their intent is to replace the Fourth of July with this new day one that will inevitably focus on America's darkest moments. ‚Äî Matt Rosendale (@RepRosendale) June 16 2021 (One can only hope he's referring to slavery as our darkest moment not the end of slavery. But one never can tell these days.) First of all someone needs to explain to Charlie that it's actually okay to have two summer holidays. It's even okay if one of those holidays is based on race. After all there is a holiday in January that honors a man who is celebrated for making racial equality his life's work isn't there? This is a whole five months later!  Second of all someone needs to tell Matt that no one is replacing the Fourth of July with Juneteenth. It's alright to have two holidays in close proximity to one another. Maybe introduce him to a calendar show him the month of December and explain that Christmas and New Year's Day are one week apart. It's been like that for YEARS. No one is concerned that New Year's Day will replace Christmas. Thirdly someone needs to introduce BOTH of these morons to a JEWISH person who will tell them that each month of the Jewish calendar (which consists of either 29 or 30 days) contains approximately 47 days of holidays so they should either STFU and stop complaining or just come right out and admit they hate Black people. And to these racists who are mad? For all the racists outraged üôÑ by Biden making #Juneteenth a federal holiday ‚Äî Trump pledged to do the same. The difference is that Biden kept his word. pic.twitter.com/710Ts5t9NK ‚Äî Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) June 17 2021 Finally there are even people on the left who are mad about this saying things along the lines of "Big deal. Make election day a federal holiday if you want to impress me" and/or "This is just symbolic. Pfffft." To them I say tell that to Rep. Joyce Beatty. Tell that to Rep. Maxine Waters. Tell that to Vice President Kamala Harris. ‚ÄúHappy Juneteenth everybody!‚Äù says Kamala Harris the nation‚Äôs first Black vice president on a day when it becomes a national holiday. pic.twitter.com/vi6OpbVe6f ‚Äî Matt Viser (@mviser) June 17 2021 #Juneteenth becomes a national holiday today! pic.twitter.com/xwSN7Cej8o ‚Äî Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) June 17 2021 Tell that to 94-year-old Opal Lee who's life work has included tireless dedication to national recognition of this holiday. That moment Ms. Opal Lee‚Äôs dream of making #Juneteenth a holiday became reality all while standing next to the first Black and Woman Vice President Harris! pic.twitter.com/1Kkx44qras ‚Äî Madam Vice President Harris is GOAT! (@flywithkamala) June 17 2021 Civil rights icon Ms. Opal Lee fought for decades to make #Juneteenth a federal holiday.One of the most joyful moments of my life was this week sitting with Opal Lee as Congress voted to make her dream come true. /1 pic.twitter.com/vG4DVUDpjt ‚Äî Shawn Lassiter (@ShawnLassiterTX) June 17 2021 Here is the story of 94-year-old-activist and "Grandmother of #Juneteenth " Ms. #OpalLee as discussed on @SXMPOTUS @SIRIUSXM !https://t.co/FqoulLD2JG ‚Äî Laura Coates (@thelauracoates) June 17 2021 We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We are trying to make election day a federal holiday. That's in the Voting Rights Bill so many of us are trying to get passed. Joe Manchin and Stacey Abrams even agree it should be in a compromise he proposed. So now that it's a holiday let's hope teachers are actually allowed to educate their students about it.  It's so American that one set of lawmakers can make #Juneteenth a federal holiday while another set works to scrub its roots from our history books. ‚Äî Edward Bowser (@etbowser) June 17 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
