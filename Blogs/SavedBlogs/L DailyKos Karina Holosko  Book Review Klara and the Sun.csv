L, Book Review: Klara and the Sun, Karina Holosko , 2021-05-04, The beauty of innocence. The tragedy when it’s pained. (Karina Holosko)  Klara and the Sun by Pulitzer prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro is a profoundly disturbing science fiction novel.   Mankind is experiencing the birth of a new life form and we have become Gods.  What keeps us human? That is the existential question that pulses through the book. Ishiguro takes a sponge and absorbs what we think we know about our own humanity and rings it out into a raging river throws us a piece of driftwood that we cling to desperate to keep afloat.   A master. This book will stay with you long after you’ve read the last page. Promise.    Klara  an AF is a  meticulously constructed biologically based humanoid designed to care for lonely children.  It is through her eyes that the story unfolds.  The Sun “nourishes” her.  The Sun is life. Of that she is acutely aware.  Ishiguro takes us on a brutal journey demanding we consider the consequences of our ability to feel empathy.  He hones in on that emotion until we are left raw empathic creatures quivering in fear propelled into action. Find a way to protect the innocence of the emerging life form that Klara represents. Are we able to accept her place in humanity as a young being's evolutionary growth and the pain that life with humans will cause her?  We meet Klara waiting in a store to be purchased to fulfill her purpose to protect and guide a lonely child. There are all kinds of models with various features and emotional systems. And the lucky AF who is showcased in the coveted window has a greater chance of finding a forever home.  Klara's window partner is Rosa. We experience their conversations as they marvel at the busy city.   Here they learn by observing the subtle details of human interaction. For instance on one rainy day they watch a man wave to a woman. She waves back and he runs toward her. The AF’s deconstruct that event match it to a human emotion and create a story that the couple once knew each other.  That's what makes Klara unique her ability to create a narrative.   Her friend Rosa an older model is not designed to make those leaps.   Ishiguro uses minimalist language and imagery designed to harness Klara’s childlike innocence  meant to evoke our empathy.  It works. He assigns simple names to the people around her; the Manager the Housekeeper the Mother.  She sits on the counter in the store and swings her legs. Obedient the AF’s do as they're told as the kindhearted Manager shuffles around her inventory.  But most significantly is Ishiguru’s symbolic use of the Sun that the AF’s call nourishment which makes them metaphorical Sun Worshipers.  Ummm. Isn’t Sun Worshiping a marker on the evolutionary scale of mankind? Is our story being hijacked? Can that be allowed? Klara is eventually bought by a young girl named Josie who is physically challenged. While her friend Rosa takes another ominous route. Not all AF’s will be protected by their master. If Rosa can feel pain laws will have to be made  her abusers held accountable. Going down that road will open up Pandora’s Box. With her charge Josie  Klara begins fulfilling her purpose and her commitment to that task inspires her to grow emotionally and connect to the world around her. It is her success at being attentive considerate willing kind and yes empathetic that pulls at our heartstrings. We want nothing bad to happen to Klara and Klara wants nothing bad to happen to Josie.   Running parallel to this plot a creepy mystery unfolds.  On one curious day Josie's Mother Chrissie takes Klara on an odd trip under the guise of seeing waterfalls. And then Chrissie gives an unsettling order. She tells Klara to pretend to be her other daughter that was "lifted.”  But if that was true why would the psychologically bruised neighbor and mother of Josie's only friend Rick from a socially and economically disadvantaged family see the girl coming through the forest? What really happened to her first daughter?  In Chrissie’s home everything seems normal. Klara becomes part of the family. She is allowed to explore the outdoors  meets their friends places her feet on foreign territory always painfully eager to please.  Foreboding grows. Please don't hurt Klara. Klara can't be hurt. Don’t take away her innocence. Don’t remind us of the pain.  Klara develops a profound understanding of life and with it the desire to live.  Then one day Josie’s illness worsens. She is dying.  Desperate to save her Klara believes that the Sun that “nourishes” her life will stop death and she sets off on a journey to follow the Sun to a barn. Not yet understanding that the Sun is in the sky she engages in what can only be explained as prayer. She negotiates with the Sun to save Josie’s life. And the Sun listens.  What Sun God is this that bestowed a miracle on an AF – proof of the most intimate relationship that God can have with man. Are not miracles reserved exclusively for humans?   Memory is a theme that runs through Ishiguro's work and this is no exception. As Klara builds her world  memory becomes an essential part of her emotional and psychological growth and they are treasures.   In turn we are pushed to examine how memory plays a role as building blocks for our own self-actualization. And as soon as we get invested in that truth Ishiguro pulls the rug out from underneath us.   Klara becomes no longer useful as a companion to a lonely child and her master does the kind thing and brings her to a junkyard to fade away. Her cohorts are not so lucky. Society has made a decision of what to do with their slaves. But are they all on the same page?   Klara enters an inner world that echoes the stages of Alzheimer's but not as a tragedy but a place of contentment. And while people around her are concerned for her well-being and believe she is suffering it is simply not the case.  It's the fading of the mind that Ishiguro has an uncanny intimate relationship with a lyrical process where memories dance get shuffled timelines disconnect.  He makes us face our fear of the process of losing memories. And we discover
