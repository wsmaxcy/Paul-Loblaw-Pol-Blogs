C, Where’s Hunter Biden? And Remember How Big Tech Says Comcast Will Censor the Internet?, Seton Motley, 2020-10-19, This has all been totally hilarious.  And by hilarious – I mean exceedingly awful. Let us again check in with our old friend Merriam Webster and his dictionary. Projection: “(T)o attribute (one’s own ideas feelings or characteristics) to other people….” Self-awareness: “(K)nowledge and awareness of your own personality or character.” Big Tech has “projection” in droves. Big Tech couldn’t find “self-awareness” with both hands and a map. For nearly two decades now Big Tech has publicly advocated and privately lobbied for for the titanically stupid Internet policy known as Network Neutrality.  And mass-funded scores of Leftist groups that have incessantly screeched for it. And the Left’s alleged reason for the near-two-decade “Crisis!!!” need to immediately impose Net Neutrality? Because without it they claim the nation’s Internet Service Providers (ISPs) – Comcast Charter Verizon AT&T etc – will allegedly censor what you do and get to see on the Internet. How the Internet Showed Up For Net Neutrality Today From Reddit to Google: “(I)nternet giants showed their support in a variety of ways…. “ISPs could potentially slow your internet speed based on the websites you visit or block certain services and websites all together….” Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook Blog Post: “We fully support net neutrality. We want to keep the internet open. Net Neutrality ensures (ISPs) don’t discriminate by limiting access to services you want to use…. “The internet…gives voice to the voiceless in our society and it connects people with vital resources for health and education.  I believe everyone in the world deserves access to these opportunities.” Twitter Policy Blog: Join the Fight for #NetNeutrality: “(W)ithout Net Neutrality in force ISPs would even be able to block content they don’t like reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs…. “You don’t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea a unique perspective to share and a compelling vision can get in the game.” Google Policy Blog: Net Neutrality Day of Action: Help Preserve the Open Internet: “(T)hese common-sense protections…prevent (ISPs from) blocking or throttling of internet traffic segmenting the internet into paid fast lanes and slow lanes and other discriminatory practices…. “Today’s open internet ensures that both new and established services whether offered by an established internet company like Google a broadband provider or a small startup have the same ability to reach users on an equal playing field.” And lest we forget – Google (actually the parent company Alphabet that Google created) owns YouTube. Never mentioned? The Internet has existed nigh entirely without Net Neutrality. (Save for about one year when the Barack Obama Administration illegally unilaterally imposed it.  The Donald Trump Administration thankfully almost immediately reversed that power grab.) And no ISP has ever blocked anyone or anything – ever. Get that?  Press the most ardent hardcore Net Neutrality proponent for a single incident of a single ISP blocking a single byte of content – in the entirety of the Internet’s Net-Neutrality-free three decade history – and they’ll begrudgingly admit it never actually happens. All of which brings us to last week – less than a month before the 2020 (Presidential) Election. And the New York Post’s Biden Crime Family story. Smoking-Gun Email Reveals How Hunter Biden Introduced Ukrainian Businessman to VP Dad Big Tech rushed to do – exactly what they spent decades baselessly accusing ISPs of maybe prospectively doing. Big Tech immediately suppressed and blocked the Biden Crime Family story. Projection: Total.  Self-Awareness: Nary a whit. Facebook Exec ADMITS Throttling NYP Story About Biden Burisma Corruption While Twitter Blocks Access And Big Tech Twitter suspended the accounts of a great many people who had shared it.  Including several very high profile users – including Donald Trump’s presidential campaign account.  And the New York Post itself. Twitter Locks Trump Campaign’s Account Over Video Related to The Post’s Hunter Biden Bombshell Power Mad Twitter Suspends WH Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s Personal Account Twitter Suspends New York Post Account Over Bombshell Hunter Biden Story And who knows what Google did to its secret Search algorithm when the Biden Crime Family story hit.  But based on Google’s history – we can guess. Google is Rigging Searches for Hillary Clinton Google is STILL Rigging Searches for Hillary Clinton Google Execs’ Trump Meltdown Reminds: There’s No Such Thing as ‘Unbiased’ YouTube Censorship: Conservatives Banned Do Facebook and Twitter have similar anti-conservative censorious pasts?  Is water wet? Project Veritas Catches Facebook Employees Contractors Admitting to Political Censorship ‘Shadow Banning’: How Twitter Secretly Censors Conservatives Without Them Even Knowing It And with Big Tech-Democrat revolving-door-in-a-phone-booth job swapping – who could have seen all this anti-conservative bias only getting exponentially worse? Obama’s Staff Is Taking Over Silicon Valley: “There was a steady drip of employees bouncing between government and tech before Obama took office. Sheryl Sandberg for example worked as chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in the ’90s before taking executive roles at Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). “But so many members of Obama’s administration have gone to San Francisco that one former political official now in the tech industry likened it to American expats hanging out in Paris after World War I.” Flash forward to Election 2020…. Social Media Backlash Resurrected Over Biden’s Transition Team’s Ties to Facebook and Twitter Twitter Staffer in Trump Attack Worked for Kamala Harris And it ain’t just Big Tech leadership.  The rank-and-file are also Donkeys through and through. Big Tech Staffers Gave Nearly $5M to Biden Less Than $250G to Trump The Big Tech anti-conservative bias is all-encompassing.  But we are to believe them when they say it does not affect their work product?  Especially now – after this mountain range of evidence against? Let us now revisit these censorious companies’ own words cited just above on the import of treating all online information equally and blocking nothing shall we? Google: “Today’s open internet ensures that both new and established services whether offered by an established internet company like Google a broadband provider or a small startup have the same ability to reach users on an equal playing field.” Zuckerberg and his Facebook: “The internet…gives voice to the voiceless in our society and it connects people with vital resources for health and education.  I believe everyone in the world deserves access to these opportunities.” Twitter: “You don’t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea a unique perspective to share and a compelling vision can get in the game.” Projection: Total.  Self-Awareness: Nary a whit. The President of the United States is unquestionably the biggest big shot of them all. And Twitter just shut down his campaign. Twitter has the power to refuse to allow the President’s campaign “to compete.”  The power to not allow the President to “get in the game.” And they used it.  Less than a month before his attempted re-elect. By censoring the Biden Crime Family story Facebook and Twitter are MASSIVELY interfering in the 2020 Election. And gifting the Biden campaign with an in-kind contribution likely valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  Probably more. Thanks to Big Tech’s censoriousness We the People aren’t being fully informed about the Biden Crime Family – as its “Pop” and “Big Guy” runs for the presidency. Which means We the People aren’t fully informed when we go to vote. And with Big Tech blockading the Biden Crime Family story Democrats any and everywhere don’t have to be publicly deal with the implications or consequences of their presidential candidate and Party being utterly corrupt. The easiest questions to answer – are the ones that are never asked. Biden Doesn’t Get One Question on Son Hunter Exposé at ABC News Town Hall Which means We the People aren’t fully informed when we go to vote. Think all of this massive Big Tech political censorship will have a little more impact on the 2020 election – than did the Russians on the 2016 election? Facebook Says It Sold $100000 in Ads to Fake Russian Accounts During Presidential Election Wow – $100000.  In a presidential election where $2 BILLION was spent.  How do you say “that’s nothing” in Russian?  (It’s “Это еще ничего” by the way.) But Big Tech has no problem with its users continuing to babble incessantly about “Russia election influence.” And Big Tech STILL has no problem with its users falsely claiming Trump-Russia collusion.  When we now know with moral certitude that Barack Obama Biden and Hillary Clinton did the Russia colluding – to then attempt a presidential coup. But Big Tech blockades stories about China Ukraine and other nations purchasing American foreign policy – likely for decades – by paying Hunter Biden billons of dollars – with “Pop” getting half. And We the People are just over two weeks away from prospectively electing “Pop” President. This is not a very neutral ‘Net you’re delivering now is it Big Tech?
