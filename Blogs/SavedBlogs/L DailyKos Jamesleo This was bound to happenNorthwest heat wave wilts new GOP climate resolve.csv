L, This was bound to happenNorthwest heat wave wilts new GOP climate resolve, Jamesleo, 2021-06-30, www.politico.com/…  I had posted a diary  the other day regarding Climate  Change as an issue that could become the dominating issue From the article A week ago three lawmakers from the Northwest joined dozens of their Republican colleagues in creating the new Conservative Climate Caucus to show they were serious about addressing the growing threats to the planet. Then they went silent as a devastating heat wave hit the region. The trio — Reps. Cliff Bentz of Oregon and Dan Newhouse and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state — have been largely invisible as the heat wave shattered temperature records melted streetcar power cables and caused rolling blackouts all the symptoms of a warming climate that scientists say will only become more common in the future. Element removed For conservatives outside of government who are anxious to see some congressional action to combat climate change it's simply a sign that Republicans haven't fully recognized the threat. “Conservatives are learning to think differently about climate change but they don’t yet know what to think” said Alex Flint executive director of Alliance for Market Solutions an organization of conservatives seeking market-friendly climate policies. “Despite this new approach many conservatives are not yet comfortable with the scale of the policy needed to address climate change” he added. This is conjecture on my part Its 97 degrees in New Paltz NY Its even hotter on the Northwest Coast. Already12 fatalities have been reported (so far) Street cars had to be halted because of “buckling from the heat It doesn’t look like the heat wave will vanish anytime soon All models and predictions are this situation will only get worse ! Between new and November 2022 anything can happen and no one can predict the future occurrences on a yearly basis So far there are no pollsshowing a public opinion shift regarding Climate Change (but its early) We do know the public does not trust the Republicans on this issue and it it becomes the predominate issue they are toast
