L, trump's July 4 rage rally in Alabama Cancelled. Nixed. Shot down., AKALib, 2021-06-29, trump’s plans of a rally on July 4 have been cancelled after USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park commissioners reportedly denied his request for the rally at the Mobile site. The commissioners were concerned that Trump’s appearance on Saturday “was going to be a partisan political event rather than just a patriotic event planned for that evening.” A Trump rally in Mobile’s Battleship Park has been cancelled amid concerns of a ‘partisan political event’. https://t.co/kgZalR16x1 Twitter is wondering about the real reason for the cancellation/humiliation. There is a God ... Perhaps they are catching on to trump the grifter who never pays his bills - AND they don't want to get stuck paying Trump's bills. Perhaps his handlers did not want another humiliation after Ohio. Or he didn't want another public humiliation. Some helpful suggestions about alternate venues - They could move the rally to the garbage dump where it belongs. A (dysfunctional) family gathering might be better for July 4? And lots of Coke. The white kind. Sad. So this is ALABAMA one of reddest states. said no to Trump for 4th of July at a battleshipKarma is not being nice to Trumpo... Trumpo so sad! So sad Trumpo? https://t.co/ui8jSmHWRH According to www.al.com/…  The park was the site of a campaign rally for 2012 Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum. “Rick Santorum was the was the straw that broke the camel’s back. And that’s when the commission went to the no partisan politics open to the public” Tunnell (chairman of the park commission) said. trump still plans to hold a rally in Sarasota FL on July 3. Yes it is satisfying to see trump get humiliated and his rallies fall flat. It is good to see a few republicans stand up against him esp. in a deep red state like Alabama. Hopefully the republican base (or some part of it) is turning a corner towards a saner future. Meanwhile let’s use these opportunities to neutralize trump McConnell and the right-wing machinery. The dark monster called the republican party and the stranglehold that trump and his lunatic supporters have on the GOP is still lurking out there chipping away at our Democracy and our national sanity. Let’s keep exposing their lies their madness and let’s keep working to win the House and the Senate in 2022.
