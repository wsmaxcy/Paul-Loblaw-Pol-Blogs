L, Thanks Cyber Ninjas! AZ Taxpayers Must Now Buy New Voting Machines, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-21, Oh dear. You mean allowing right-wing nut jobs to fuel their delusions was a bad idea all along -- one that will cost millions more? Via ABC15 in Arizona: PHOENIX AZ — ABC15 has obtained a copy of a letter sent by Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs to Maricopa County in which she threatens to de-certify the county’s election equipment that was handed over to the audit by the Senate subpoena. In the letter Hobbs said her office “consulted with election technology and security experts including at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency regarding the appropriate next steps and each unanimously advised that once election officials lose custody and control over voting systems and components those devices should not be reused in further elections. At the end of the letter Hobbs advises county election officials that should they chose to reuse the equipment they will begin the de-certification process. This equipment was accessed by amateur uncertified “auditors” with zero transparency. I support election integrity and therefore can’t support the continued usage of these machines. https://t.co/pwjQjpnkWp — Secretary Katie Hobbs (@SecretaryHobbs) May 20 2021 Oh and the state will have to cover the costs for Maricopa County: Important reminder: GOP Senate President @FannKfann signed an agreement indemnifying Maricopa County from the cost to procure new equipment. https://t.co/clwik8G4aO — Ben Giles (@ben_giles) May 20 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
