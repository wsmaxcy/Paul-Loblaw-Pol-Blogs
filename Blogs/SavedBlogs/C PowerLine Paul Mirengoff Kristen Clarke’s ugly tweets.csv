C, Kristen Clarke’s ugly tweets, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-24, Kristen Clarke is Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. She’s an odd pick or would be in a normal administration given her history of  sponsoring anti-Semitism and advancing the idea that  Blacks are superior to Whites. Clarke will argue that this happened long ago during her college days. However she is  on record as holding another nominee to what he said while in college and insisting that he not be confirmed because of it.  Clarke’s problems are hardly limited to her college days though. She’s been  active on Twitter in very recent years and some of her tweets are problematic to say the least. For example in January 2019 Clarke  promoted Jussie Smollett’s bogus hate crime allegations in posts on Twitter. She also criticized the Chicago police department for seeking access to Smollett’s cell phone. Are Senators like Joe Manchin Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski comfortable turning the Civil Rights Division over to someone who uncritically accepts dubious hate crime claims and attacks law enforcement officials for trying to determine the truth of such claims? We’ll see. There is reason to believe that these Senators are uncomfortable with nominees who attack them personally. Neera Tanden found that out the hard way.  Clarke  checks that box too. In February 2017 she blasted Sen. Manchin for voting to confirm Jeff Sessions as attorney general. When Manchin praised Martin Luther King Clarke accused him of uttering “hollow words.”  As for Sen. Murkowski Clarke called her “shameful.” Murkowski’s sin? She voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.  The Daily Caller News Foundation  reported on Clarke’s problematic tweets earlier this month. It now reports that Clarke has  restricted access to her Twitter account. But her tweets stand as evidence of her intemperance and contempt for even moderate politicians who don’t fully subscribe to her radical agenda. She cut no slack to Manchin and Murkowski when they voted to confirm respected conservative nominees (including their former colleague Jeff Sessions). Now these Senators should cut Clarke no slack regardless of how apologetic she pretends to be at her confirmation hearing.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
