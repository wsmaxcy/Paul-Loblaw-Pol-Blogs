L, Florida governor Ron DeSantis suspends any remaining COVID restrictions, OK Dodo, 2021-05-03, An executive order was made by Governor Ron DeSantis today nullifying all local COVID-19 restrictions and emergency orders. The executive order will be coded into Florida law beginning the 1st of July. However private businesses retain the right to enforce mask mandates and social distancing within their respective properties.  “The fact is we are no longer in a state of emergency” DeSantis said during a news conference. He acknowledged that Florida was still not done with its fight against the coronavirus but reiterated the nation’s decline in Covid-19 cases and deaths. “I think that’s the evidence-based thing to do” DeSantis said adding that asking vaccinated individuals to continue to wear masks would undermine confidence in the coronavirus vaccines. DeSantis cited the decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccinations to the point that the state of Florida has a surplus of vaccines as the reason to lift the COVID restrictions.  “I think folks that are saying they need to be policing people at this point if you are saying that you are really saying that you don’t believe in the vaccine you don’t believe in the data you don’t believe in the science. We’ve embraced the vaccines we’ve embraced the science on it the data I’ve said has been good from the beginning of the clinical trials and it’s even better in real life. It’s available we want everyone to get it and if you get it just know that the reason you get it is because we want to be able to have people enjoy themselves and live freely in Florida ” he said.   …   “The evidence tells us we are over a year into this people can act with normal order but emergency orders these extraordinary measures at this point are not justifiable” said DeSantis. As of the 3rd of May Florida is at least seeing a decline in coronavirus cases at least according to data. However the cases per capita remain high compared to a majority of states along with the positive test rate. Places like Miami-Dade Broward Orange and Polk counties are at a very high risk of COVID at this time of writing. When comparing Florida to other states vaccination rates are roughly in the middle of the pack.
