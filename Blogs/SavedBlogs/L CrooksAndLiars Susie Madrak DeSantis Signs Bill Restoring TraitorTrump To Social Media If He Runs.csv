L, DeSantis Signs Bill Restoring TraitorTrump To Social Media If He Runs, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-25, Trump suck-up Ron DeSantis signed a bill in Florida Monday that aims to punish Twitter and Facebook for booting off his capo. Today Floridians are being guaranteed protection against the Silicon Valley power grab on speech thought and content. We the people are standing up to tech totalitarianism with the signing of Floridaâ€™s Big Tech Bill. https://t.co/cDewFJiEPk â€” Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 24 2021 The legislation bars social media platforms from suspending political candidates while they're running for office. It's not hard to figure out that Ron DeSantis really really wants Trump to like him. The law is probably unconstitutional and will almost certainly be overturned. But it will make a certain Orange Cheeto happy and that's all that counts amirite? And if Florida voters are okay with the time and money expended on these theatrical bills their legislators churn out instead of helping them well who am I to complain? Today the Florida GOP enacted a law to punish Twitter FB etc from banning white nationalists Anti-Muslim bigots and anti-Semites. Not surprising given who makes up today's GOP â€” (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) May 24 2021 Florida barred Project Veritas founder James Oâ€™Keefe from fundraising due to a criminal conviction. Today he shared the stage with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis while signing the #MAGA Trump Social Media Protection Bill.#DeathSantis is as crooked as they come & he needs to go! pic.twitter.com/P7kj0jZpRe â€” The Jewish Ginger Resister (@EricHaftelLive) May 25 2021 This bill for now is purely performative. As much as he might want to @RonDeSantisFL canâ€™t dictate who @twitter @Facebook or any other private company allows on their platforms. But this bill is a calling card for the kind of autocracy Trump and his acolytes like DeSantis want. https://t.co/u4hiMpVpU4 â€” Joy-Ann (Democracy Fan) Reid ðŸ˜· (@JoyAnnReid) May 25 2021 I donâ€™t like the Florida social media law that Governor DeSantis just signed. Itâ€™s a bad idea parts of it are almost certainly illegal and unenforceable and it has an absurd special-interest carve-out for Disney. https://t.co/jB9Gj95hE1 â€” Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) May 25 2021 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis: "When you deplatform the President of the United States but you let Ayatollah Khamenei talk about killing Jews that is wrong." pic.twitter.com/zRGRvw8WtY â€” The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) May 24 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
