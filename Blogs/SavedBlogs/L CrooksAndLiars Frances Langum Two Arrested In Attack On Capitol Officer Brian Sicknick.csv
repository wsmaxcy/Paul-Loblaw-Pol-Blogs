L, Two Arrested In Attack On Capitol Officer Brian Sicknick, Frances Langum, 03-15-21, Here's hoping the family of Brian Sicknick get some justice for the death of their loved one.   CBS: CBS reports that "Julian Elie Khater 32 of State College Pennsylvania and George Pierre Tanios 39 of Morgantown West Virginia are accused of spraying police officers with a chemical spray. They face nine counts including assault on a federal officer with a dangerous weapon." Kater and Tanios appear on surveillance tape talking about "the bear s**t" and were later shown on video to have sprayed the chemical in the Capitol building. 3/ Multiple tipsters fingered George Tanios (@FBI #254) & Julian Khater (FBI #190).Tipsters also directed the investigators to Facebook postings by Tanios of himself at the #Capitol wearing the same outfit in the FBI's BOLO pic of him. pic.twitter.com/vTYudjwQIY — John Scott-Railton (@jsrailton) March 15 2021 NEW IMAGES: Julian Khater bear spraying #Capitol Police officer Sicknick & his colleagues.

Prayers for family of Officer Sicknick family as they continue the loss of his life.  Sadly each person he touched now has a new difficult journey going forward.  May these persons have serious consequences. — Louise Broughton (@becca100165) March 15 2021 It is just the charges on which they arrested them. They will likely end up in court in an array of charges. Prosecutors will try to get the harshest penalty possible but will also keep lesser charges in their back pocket in case not everything is sticking in court. — Chris (@ChrisBlackatron) March 15 2021 Just a wild guess here before reading the story: NOT antifa.
