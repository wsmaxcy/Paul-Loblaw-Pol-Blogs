L, Insurrectionist Youtuber & Qanon Consipiracy Nut Describes His Role At Capitol As "Journalist", PvtJarHead, 2021-05-03, Raw Story Meet Andrew Jackson Morgan Jr. of Maxwell Texas. The FBI charged him April 8 with the usual charges of unlawful entry obstruction of an official proceeding and violent entry or disorderly conduct in connection with the riot. But there's also one for "aiding and abetting" that would suggest an active role in "encouraging" others in the crowd. (snip) Morgan is identified by the FBI as "the content creator of a YouTube video channel called "Political Trance Tribune." That where "he presents as a law enforcement 'auditor'" the FBI complaint states. The report says agents acted on a video linked to the FBI tip line. The report alleges that Morgan "while filming other protesters can be heard encouraging them to make entry" into the Capitol. Business Insider In an hour of self-recorded videos seen by Insider Morgan shows himself to be sandwiched between insurrectionists as they smash a Capitol window and fight with police officers. He can be heard throughout encouraging them yelling "keep moving" and "send helmets forward." Several times Morgan can be heard begging to be shot and teargassed. "I'm here first y'all gonna slide in right behind me" he said. "I'm gonna take the bullet first. I want the bullet. Give me my bullet." (snip) The 60-year-old did admit that he joined the mob in pushing their way into the Capitol.  "When I got up to the doorway I participated in the heave-ho heave-ho" he said. It felt like the "right thing at the moment" he added. The Daily Beast When authorities executed a search warrant at Morgan’s house last month he told FBI agents he wanted to tell “his story.” He said he went to D.C. because “something unprecedented” was going to happen and he wanted to cover the events “because he is an independent journalist and civil rights auditor.” His wife also told the FBI she drove Morgan to the Capitol “with a group of political auditors” who she said sometimes refer to themselves as “independent patriots.” “Morgan reiterated he was there was a ‘chameleon’” the complaint states. “He said he wishes now that he had not said the things that he did but just filmed the events.” Morgan also told authorities he was “concerned that the government has been hijacked” and was “concerned why Mike Lindell's video about election fraud was banned.” “He is like-minded with the Founder's of the country and with QAnon. He has come to realize that the people in power keep power through child pedophilia. They use child pedophilia to control the masses” he allegedly said.
