L, Guys have a real problem a tendency towards violence and aggression, Dem, 2021-04-27, There is a show which demonstrates very well how unnecessarily macho violent and aggressive guys often are and why most guys vote republican and for Donald Trump and why guys make so many mistakes with unnecessary aggression. The show I am talking about highlights this because it involves robotics and building complex fighting robots. There are great women builders and team leaders of their bots but in my observations the women didn’t make the unnecessarily risky decisions of extra aggression that the guys do. Ever.   I am disappointed at how unnecessarily macho and recklessly aggressive guys often are. I have watched battle bots on discovery channel where teams build bots with weapons to attack other bots in 1 on 1 bot against bot fights. They have a tournament with prizes. They have 50 to 80 pound spinning metal disks that can spin at up to or even exceeding 200 mph both vertical spinners and horizontal spinners as weapons. They have wheels and armor and “lifters “ which can lift 1000 pounds to flip other bots . If a driver (using a remote control) cannot show controlled movement then they get counted out by a referee . They have ten seconds to show the referee controlled movement. Your team wins if the referee counts the other team’s bot out because of lack of controlled movement or by a decision as judged by three referees all of whom used to be participants.   I see these guys with their bots have a certain win and all they have to do is stay away from the other team’s bot because the other team’s bot has been so damaged that it is obvious that they cannot move and therefore  it is certain that the referee is about to start the countdown. All they have to do is stay away.  Their own bot itself may have already suffered some significant damage which means rushing their bot at the other bot which still has a working and violent weapon even though it can’t move is an unnecessarily risky thing to do.  You’ve got a certain victory. Stay away . Don’t clutch defeat from the jaws of victory right ? No these macho aggressors send their own damaged bots at an opponent’s bot which clearly can’t move and which will clearly be counted out and by doing so  needlessly risk a loss.  Even if the other team’s weapon isn’t working rushing your own bot with your weapon at a disabled bot is unnecessarily risky because these hits are incredibly violent breaking pieces apart sending entire 250 pound bots 12 or even 15 feet in the air. For every action  there is an equal and opposite action  so your bot will absorb damage and your bot could get so damaged that your bot gets counted out because now due to your unnecessary aggression your bot can’t move because you took a completely unnecessary risk.  Yet these macho aggressors make that same choice every time. It’s rather amazing. I should wonder that they don’t need their mother to dress them or hold their hands to cross the street.   The commentators only slightly acknowledge the stupidity of taking the unnecessary risk. It’s just a matter of time before it will cost some team in a tournament. I want to see that happen where they lose because it is a SINGLE LOSS ELIMINATION tournament tournament in order to see the response after a loss. The commentators would have to call them out to their face for the unnecessary risky aggression in the post fight interview and they would be booted from the tournament because they lost because they did that.  Would they understand that they had made a mistake ?   Is the goal to win ? If it’s not then why enter a tournament. You can be violent in practice without a tournament by just fighting them without a tournament. So the object of entering the tournament has to be to win. That should be the one and only objective.  This is a primary reason I suspect that guys (especially younger guys of color) 1 vote for republicans and Donald Trump. This is it. This is why the history of countries led by men is a history of wars and violence and mistakes. This is a perfect illustration of this because one might think that anybody building complex robots is educated and intelligent . So when we see these types of decisions made by guys even when they are relatively educated and smart enough to build a complex robot then it makes it crystal clear that guys have a real problem. Are there exceptions? Of course. However it certainly appears true for the  overwhelming majority of guys.  This might be considered a bunch of anecdotes and it is certainly not a random sample. However this is a sample that one would think would be less likely than the general population to demonstrate this trait . If it is true even of this group of guys then it seems even more likely to be true of guys in general.   This scholarly article examines testosterone and the brain and the violent tendencies of men.  This article examines males in London and predictors of violence and aggression. Dr. Furtuna considers the question why are men more violent in this article.   Here is the beginning of his article:  In almost every society men are the ones who are overwhelmingly involved in wars in all kinds of intergroup aggressions and intragroup homicide. They mobilize themselves in armies of violent fans in criminal gangs and in bands of thugs. These old observations have created a distinction between male and female sexes regarding their predisposition to violence. Wars are a biosocial product of men and a field for male’s manifestation [Goldstein 2001]. The same thing is true of crime and cruelty which are closely linked to masculinity. Among these societies men committed homicide on average 26 times more frequently than women [Daly Wilson 1994]. Also familicides (the killing of family members) are committed mostly by men. Some data have shown that men were involved in more than 90 percent of cases [Wilson Daly 1997 p. 160].  In the U.S. in 2004 85 percent of total serious crimes were committed by men. Ninety-two percent of serial killers from the U.S. are men [1].  . This article points out that nurture alone cannot explain the aggression of men.  This article considers the neurobiological mechanisms which are associated with the gender differences in violence and aggression. This article contemplates harmful masculinity and violence.   I believe bigotry as well as a proclivity towards aggression and violence  underlies the support of white men for republicans and the former guy.  I suspect that the tendency towards machismo violence and aggression is why younger guys of color are more likely to support the former guy and republicans than people of color in general.
