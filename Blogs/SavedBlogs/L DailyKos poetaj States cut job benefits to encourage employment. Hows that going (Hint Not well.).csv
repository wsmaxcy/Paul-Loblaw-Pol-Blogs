L, States cut job benefits to encourage employment. How's that going? (Hint: Not well.), poetaj, 2021-06-27, Well this is embarrassing. Or it should be. Certain that the only reason people weren’t flocking to fill job openings was that the $300 added to state unemployment benefits was a disincentive 26 states including Missouri have decided to cut the benefit. From the New York Times: Work-force development officials said they had seen virtually no uptick in applicants since the governor’s announcement which ended a $300 weekly supplement to other benefits. And the online job site Indeed found that in states that have abandoned the federal benefits clicks on job postings were below the national average. Many economists warned that the $300 was not the main employment deterrent. Lack of child care continued fear of COVID infection low wages and more were holding people out of the job market. But know-it-all governors and legislators just couldn’t pass up a chance to make the poor poorer. Willful ignorance.  Politics of Poverty is presented by ButterflyPAC the only super PAC focused solely on an end to poverty and hunger. We give political power to the poor. www.butterflypac.com
