L, It is going to be interesting how the Senate handles the talking painfully public filibuster, sreeizzle2012, 2021-04-25, www.realclearpolitics.com/… projects.fivethirtyeight.com/… What benchmark are you using to determine if Biden will win 62-37 historic landslide 2024? Particularly if Trump or a wannabe Trump runs?  I strongly believe Joe Biden needs to continue he wants republicans-independents-3rd party-Democrats to come together and constructively engage in empathetic solution disagreement.  Kyrsten Sinema needs to stop being the scapegoat of “we can’t do that” while at the same time encouraging constructive disagreement.  Joe Manchin needs to be instrumental in making the filibuster extremely painful/talking for 50 republicans who want to sustain it against the American people public pressure.  THEN after enough republicans are scared to lose in 2022 plus fear DC statehood something has to give. I am optimistic the talking painful public pressure filibuster will either force enough republicans to force the filibuster threshold to reduce.  Gun Violence Safety Security Solution bill  DC statehood bill  John Lewis voting anti gerrymandering bill anti election voting corruption bill  Other regular order non-reconciliation bills such as minimum wage   When running in 2022 there needs to be non stop campaigns about stopping Mitch Mcconnell from being majority leader ever again.  I feel Wisconsin Pennsylvania and North Carolina are decent pick up opportunities.  Ohio and Florida will be competitive without Trump on the ballot but are very difficult.  Georgia is a decent hold for us.  DC statehood should be established if they mean providing a safe “2 seat buffer cushion” from Mcconnell. Furthermore we don’t have to deal with Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.
