L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Steve Watkins, republicinsanity, 2021-06-27, Welcome to what is the 996th profile here at “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” where we’ll be profiling the former U.S. House Representative from Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District Steve Watkins who served in office for one term after winning an UGLY election in 2018. To his credit Watkins had a pretty impressive start to his resume for “credible badass” as far as people we profile go being a graduate of West Point an veteran of the war in Afghanistan. After leaving the military and starting a career as a defense contractor Watkins focused on a simple hobby of y’know running sled dogs in Alaska including in the Iditarod (he finished in 58th place out of 66 competitors in 2015).But reporters fascinated with the guy began to notice a lot of the other details Watkins was providing about his  professional career though that had… let’s just say some inconsistencies that looked like he may have padded his resume as a candidate a bit and Watkins played the “FAKE NEWS” card that Donald Trump made infamous.  Watkins continuously was trying to win Trump’s endorsement to push himself to the head of the pack in the primary and prior to getting fired Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale noted Watkins was sending out mailers with Trump on them without the endorsement of the White House occupant. And his primary opponents were asking the question “Wait how can he have two homes in Alaska and be dog-sledding up there and also be living in Kansas where he’s never voted? His guy’s carpet-bagging man!” The Associated Press took note that there was no sign Watkins had lived in Kansas since leaving for the military in high school but still with a crowded seven-candidate primary field Watkins emerged victorious with 26.5% of the vote in it.  Watkins still had to beat Democrat Paul Davis in the general election and eventually officially won favor with the nation’s hot-garbage-chief-executive by supporting Trump’s stupid f***ing idea for a physical wall on the U.S./Mexico border saying things in favor of it like  "That doesn’t make us mean-spirited or the racist bigots that some leftists would have you believe. It’s just common sense“ or the quite White Nationalist-ish statement of “I want to keep our culture” about it. So OF COURSE Donald Trump ended up appearing with him at a rally in October 2018. Like many Trump-endorsed candidates Steve Watkins was then accused of sexually harassing a woman who he worked with on an Alaskan military base only days after getting Trump’s seal-of-approval (not that Trump would retract it after his endorsing of Roy Moore showing how little he cared about if men he endorsed were creeps).      And yet and YET… Steve Watkins still won that race by less than a percentage point say by around 2200 votes in the Blue Wave year which should just be regarded as having the benefit of Kansas’ 2nd District having a +11 Republican lean in the Cook Partisan Voting Index. Watkins’ tenure was a clear and repeated pattern of idiocy: So what was it that really made us focus on this one-term member of the House and profile him other than his voting record? Well it would be that he helped prove the Republican Party’s incessant complaints about voter fraud by committing such an act personally and filing his voter information with the Federal Elections Commission that listed his residence in Topeka as what was actually the location for a UPS Store. Yes all the questions regarding his residence seemed to hold some merit. Three separate felony charges were filed related to the voter fraud he personally committed and he was slapped with a fourth charge for lying to a detective who was investigating the matter. Watkins chalked it up to being just an error and only narrowly avoided jail time by signing a controversial agreement with the Shawnee County District Attorney’s office where he admitted all four of the things he was charged with were true. (White privilege has its perks it seems). Steve Watkins ended up losing in the GOP primary in 2020 for his seat what with all the fraud surrounding him losing in the GOP Primary with about 34% of the vote. We would like to wish him our heartiest “GOOD RIDDANCE” salutes at this time.       One Year Ago June 27th 2020: Lynne DiSanto (SD)Two Years Ago June 27th 2019: Ron Beaty (MA)Three Years Ago June 27th 2018: Dave Trott (MI)Four Years Ago June 27th 2017: Paul Blair (OK)… 2017 UpdateFive Year Ago June 27th 2016: Alex Beinstein (CO)Six Years Ago June 27th 2015: John Lloyd Ellis (AL)
