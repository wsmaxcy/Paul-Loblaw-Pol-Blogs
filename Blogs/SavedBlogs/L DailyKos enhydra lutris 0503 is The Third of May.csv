L, 05/03 is "The Third of May", enhydra lutris, 2021-05-03, Today is day 123 of the Gregorian Calendar yearPungenday Discord 50 3187 YOLD (discordian)And let us not forget 113.0.8.8.15 mlc (the Mayan Long Count) The Third of May 1808 is a painting by Francisco de Goya which memorializes the execution of hundreds of Madrileños by French occupying forces on that date.  This was the aftermath of a popular uprising by Madrid's citizenry against the French forces on May 2 1808 ( El Dos De Mayo ) now a holiday in Madrid which was one of the events that set off The Peninsular War. The Dos de Mayo Uprising wasn't an organized unified event but numerous ad hoc rebellions that broke out across Madrid including an attack on  The Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard  a french cavalry unit that had been sent to clear the streets by the citizenry.  That particular piece of the uprising was also memorialized by Francisco de Goya as what else The Second of May 1808 aka The Charge of the Mamelukes.  The two paintings shown are hung in Madrid's Prado as part of a very good collection of Goya's works there.  Today is "World Press Freedom Day". Much will be made of this by assorted politicians and governments and the petty sycophantic stenographers who feed the world recycled government and corporate press releases under the guise of "News" while you languish in prison for the crime of real journalism for having had the audacity to expose US war crimes and report other unwelcome truths. Know that you are appreciated. Know that many see through this sham of a holiday with its mind numbing irony and support you but not the hordes of stenographers who are quite happy to see you imprisoned and tortured for doing what they for whatever reasons cannot bring themselves to do.
