L, John Cornyn Asks If Biden Is 'Really In Charge' Because He Doesn't Tweet A Lot, Ron Dicker, 2021-04-12, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) spun a Politico article Monday about President Joe Biden‚Äôs limited participation on Twitter and cable news to criticize his leadership. The article ‚ÄúBiden White House media doctrine: Less can be more‚Äù outlined the White House strategy to emphasize quality messaging over quantity using Cabinet members to discuss policy when appropriate and having Biden speak directly to the camera on ‚Äúmarquee‚Äù issues. Politico‚Äôs tone appeared more observational than critical but Cornyn repurposed a passage into an indictment of the president. Quoting an excerpt Cornyn tweeted: ‚ÄúThe president is not doing cable news interviews. Tweets from his account are limited and when they come unimaginably conventional. The public comments are largely scripted. Biden has opted for fewer sit down interviews with mainstream outlets and reporters.‚Äù The senator then followed with his own words: ‚ÄúInvites the question: is he really in charge?‚Äù The president is not doing cable news interviews. Tweets from his account are limited and when they come unimaginably conventional. The public comments are largely scripted. Biden has opted for fewer sit down interviews with mainstream outlets and reporters. Invites the question: is he really in charge? The question invited harsh answers. Texas Senator John Cornyn is complaining that President Biden isn't throwing enough 5am Twitter tantrums & making unhinged phone calls into Fox News like the Former Guy because John Cornyn would rather have a President who SHREDS America in half rather than stitches it back up. You know what's fantastic John? I don't have to worry anymore about what our President is saying on TV or on phone calls to foreign leaders or what he's tweeting. I don't worry that he's plotting to undermine the country or that he's in office solely to enrich himself. 1/2 John Cornyn is big mad that President Biden is too busy working to spend time on Twitter. Ohhhh & we are grateful for it. Normalcy has returned to our White House. üôè pic.twitter.com/XaIJ1f5n4M Normalcy AND competency. What a confidence-inspiring combo -- Like America won the leadership lottery and we finally have a REAL POTUS to show for it! Johnny- this is gonna come as a shock to you but the American people don‚Äôt elect a President based on how frequently he or she will tweet. Now this one‚Äôs really is gonna blow your mind so buckle up‚Ä¶ The President of the United States of America is supposed to lead not tweet. pic.twitter.com/Oto4tu2Ko5 "If a president isn't on Twitter constantly is he really even a president?" I have no idea what Joe Biden did yesterday. I have no idea what he's doing right now. I have no idea what he watches on TV. it's fucking glorious Let me know when he steals from charity commits treason or incites an attempted coup. I‚Äôll wait. pic.twitter.com/hVmu8VQ3xb So apparently this is just a word-for-word quote from the very beginning of the article which‚Äîto be fair to the writer of the article‚Äîis not intended to be a criticism just an observation.Cornyn of course spins it into a vile criticism about Biden's mental accuity.
