L, The Verdict is in on the George Floyd case: Too little too late or is this a positive step forward?, Chris Townsend, 2021-04-21, A justice was done for George Floyd today with the guilty verdict of former Police Officer Derek Chauvin. But what’s almost as important is justice was done for all those who  have stood up in protest this past year not just for George Floyd but for countless other black men and women who have been killed needlessly by the Police just because of the color of their skin. A lot of the times the Officers get off Scott free or at least with a small slap on the wrist. But this time is different! This time Derek Chauvin will pay for his crime of racism and Hate. This time people can feel that justice was served.  Some might think it’s too little too late and they aren’t completely wrong for feeling that way. Where is the justice for Trayvon Martin or Breonna Taylor? Where is the repercussions from the death of Rayshard Brooks? Enough is enough!   We need to reform and reshape our law Enforcement system. There needs to be more training. There needs to be stiffer punishments. There needs to be more investigations of reports against police that are deemed possibly racist. American citizens shouldn’t have to live in fear but they do. Black Americans worry every time they are pulled over or stopped in the street. They literally worry for their lives. Enough is enough!  We need to stop looking at the color of the skin but what is in our hearts. This is the same beating heart we all have despite our color. We are all just trying to make our way through life striving to be healthy happy and successful despite our color. We need to grow as a people. We need to recognize our differences as a blessing. We need to move on from our racist ways and work together to make our world a better place. Enough is enough! We should all look at this guilty verdict in the George Floyd’s case not as a huge victory but as a stepping stone toward equality. We can’t sit back now. The door is open a crack with this verdict. We must push our way through and fight for what is right because ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
