C, Cuomo continues, Scott Johnson, 2021-02-16, I took a whack at Governor Cuomo last week in “Blame it on the Donald.” An update is warranted. At another of his press conferences yesterday he dispersed the blame for his own shoddy performance across an incredibly broad landscape. Victor Davis Hanson took up Governor Cuomo in his February 14 American Greatness column “The wages of Trump hatred.” Here is a handy summary of events leading to yesterday’s presser: Cuomo may have had the second-worst record of any governor in the United States in terms of deaths per million from the virus (currently 2361 per million New York residents second to next-door New Jersey). He may have shut down his state dr[iven] out millions to seek refuge elsewhere ruined New York’s economy and yet suffered more deaths and inflicted more damage on his own than a similarly sized open and economically rebounding Florida and Texas. Still Cuomo had one advantage those red-state governors lacked: a large left-wing media platform to blast the hated Trump.  Now again mysteriously after the inauguration of Joe Biden we learn the sordid details about Cuomo in the fashion revelations appear daily and simultaneously about the Lincoln Project. It was known long ago that Cuomo in a panic about the epidemic had shuttled infected patients into the state’s extended care homes—and by executive fiat—where they proved mobile Petri dishes infecting vulnerable residents who began dying en masse.  Cuomo might have stopped the awful practice. He might have announced the accurate number of the dead to highlight the need to end immediately the lunatic diversions. Instead we now learn he ordered his aides to hide the lethality figures. If he was blasted for 8000 rest home deaths then what he feared would be the public reaction at the true figure of 15000 dead? Would the president whom he demagogued now demagogue him? So Cuomo lied. He hid the grim data from a media all too eager before November 3 to comply. He lied to the New York state legislature. He lied to the U.S. Department of Justice. He lied to the public. And he assumed these were all “noble lies”—necessary for the good cause of ending Donald Trump.  I have posted the video of Cuomo’s press conference yesterday below in its entirety. Cuomo looks like he’s morphing into Richard Nixon in the dark days of Watergate though Nixon never had a compliant media contingent or the support of a cultural elite. The New York Post has nevertheless distinguished itself with its clear-eyed news and editorial coverage. Today the Post’s news pages give us “Democrats slam ‘lying’ Cuomo over COVID-19 nursing home ‘cover-up’” and “FAIL! Majority of voters flunk Cuomo’s handling of COVID nursing home deaths.” Over on the Post’s opinion pages columnist Michael Goodwin has more in “Gov. Cuomo’s ‘heartless’ distortions can’t hide truth.” Seth Barron adds to the press point VDH makes above in the Post column “Adoring media served as protective cloak for Cuomo’s COVID lies.” The Post’s editors have more here. The Post has flooded the Cuomo zone. Beyond the Post however Mediaite’s Josh Feldman compiled the running commentary of a passionate observer in “Fox’s Janice Dean Torches Cuomo as She Live-Tweets Presser: ‘Same Old Nonsense Lies… We Are Not Confused Governor.’” Video via Governor Cuomo Updates New Yorkers on State’s Progress During COVID-19 Pandemic.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
