L, Policy proposal - give funds for developing better grass so we don't waste so much water, boblite, 2021-06-27, I find it totally amazing that in this technologically advanced country that has sent probes into the far planets we have not yet developed a great grass that puts down deep roots and will survive 100 degree weather and requires much less water than the current set of grasses. Zillions of gallons of water would be saved with such a grass.   UPDATE:  Great grass would also survive extreme cold winters and stay green throughout winter.  And survive hotter than 100 degrees.  And destroy other grasses and weeds.  And prevent soil erosion.  And grow in poor soil.  And germinate easily and spread rapidly.   UPDATE 2: An additional criterion should be to greatly reduce the need for fertilizer and pesticide. UPDATE 3: I am to be totally honest completely astounded at the amount of hostility aroused by a simple proposal to reduce water use by looking for grass with greatly improved characteristics: I should add also to the list of desired characteristics greatly reduced use of fertilizer and pesticide. Some commenters seem to be hung up on an overwhelming loathing for grass. Some seem to think existing grasses or ground covers are good enough without considering the possibility that properly funded research may discover far better alternatives.   Water shortage is a very real future threat throughout the world.  Discovery of plants that consume less water and have other desirable characteristics should be high priority.
