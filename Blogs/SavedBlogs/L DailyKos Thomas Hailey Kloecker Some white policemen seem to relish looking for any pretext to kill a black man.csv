L, Some white policemen seem to relish looking for any pretext to kill a black man, Thomas Hailey Kloecker, 2021-04-20, Instead of protecting and serving the community some white policemen seem to see policing as a legal and convenient way to go hunting for black men to kill. All they need is a good pretext. One promising pretext to kill a black man is pulling a black man's car over for minor infractions and then finding a way any way to escalate matters that end up "requiring” a bullet.  Any minor infraction will do like selling a single cigarette on the sidewalk. Or passing a $20 bill that looked counterfeit. Don't stores have machines that can detect a counterfeit bill in less than a second? I know they have such devices in third-world countries. There is no evidence that George Floyd knew he was passing a counterfeit bill or if in fact that the bill itself was counterfeit. Yet Floyd was maltreated and eventually ended up dead because as one of the officers told him he had committed "forgery.”  Part of the con used by blood-thirsty white cops to kill a black man is counting on the black man resisting. Any black man knows that any encounter with white cops can mean a death sentence--over nothing. Any trifling wrong move or wrong document can escalate matters that end up meaning a ready bullet. So while a black man may try to be compliant the black man also knows that even compliance may not be enough to save his life. This is why being hesitant to answer questions or getting out of a car may seem like the best thing to do to save stay alive. You know that what the white policeman asks you to do may be the very excuse he has for killing you. When a white police officer enjoys killing blacks any encounter however small can be life-ending. The black man can do his best to do everything requested but the black man also knows that a white cop who intends to kill him has a thousand tricks up his uniform sleeve to achieve his goal.  Police killings of black men are the new lynching. Racist white police enjoy going out on their shifts because they enjoy hunting down and killing black men. It is sport to them. It is legalized protected lynching but without the tree or the rope or the crowd of hundreds of smiling whites milling below. Killing black men is fun for some racist cops a reason to get up out of bed with joy in your heart. Today's the day I might if I'm lucky get to kill a black man. Not all police not the majority of course but some. That some are enough for black men to be killed by white police every day in this country.
