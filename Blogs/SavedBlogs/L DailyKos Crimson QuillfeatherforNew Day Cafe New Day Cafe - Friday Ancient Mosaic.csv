L, New Day Cafe - Friday: Ancient Mosaic, Crimson QuillfeatherforNew Day Cafe, 2021-04-23, Good morning Newdists.  Has everyone had at least one vaccine jab by now?  I lost internet connection for 5 hours on Thurs late afternoon Ugh.   Two tweets —   People do change.  Eight years ago when I was in Congress and @BarackObama was President I would have reflexively railed against him for saying this. Now I agree with him. And thank him for saying it. Because now I understand it. Barack Obama has always gotten it. He hasn’t changed. I have. https://t.co/53wfOZsI9x  COVID may linger...  Warning from @ScottGottliebMD: COVID will persist as a seasonal menace and respiratory precautions will be "a fact of life ... for a number of years."We’re not "going to be having holiday parties in ... the back room of a crowded restaurant on Dec. 20." https://t.co/IMYZMCxb8y pic.twitter.com/XXfqw0FxUs  .

There is something very special about seeing a #Roman mosaic peek out of a trench during excavations - in this case from a Roman villa located in a vineyard at Negrar di Valpolicella (Italy).
