L, should Noah Hawley cast Josh Hawley in the Alien TV series, annieliforToday In Heightened Contradictions, 2021-07-03, "It's not a Ripley story" And it’s not a Ridley story either but it may retain the critique of corporate capitalism that has always animated the franchise. It’s being accused of being ‘too woke’ before it’s even been written and by the same whiners whose Trumpist misogyny got triggered by the Ghostbusters reboot. The added possibility is that Josh Hawley is no Fred Thompson which for the creator of TV’s Fargo could be an asset. An Alien movie set on Earth is something that the films teased in Alien Resurrection and never made good on (unless you count the AvP movies which sure have fun). But according to Hawley setting the show on Earth opens up some Alien mayhem for the corporate headquarters. Instead of dealing with the working class truckers for the company and the marine grunts from the first two movies Hawley says he’s dealing with “what happens when the inequality we’re struggling with now isn’t resolved.” “If we as a society can’t figure out how to prop each other up and spread the wealth then what’s going to happen to us?” he said. “There’s that great Sigourney Weaver line to Paul Reiser where she says ‘I don’t know which species is worse. At least they don’t fuck each other over for a percentage.’” Over the past decade Ridley Scott has expanded the idea of what the Alien series is about. To some Ridley went too far in his quest for the next evolutionary step and our relationship with God. Now it sounds like Hawley is going the other way. However given what he’s done with Fargo it wouldn’t be too surprising if he worked those themes in as well. In the meantime we’re looking forward to what hatches—so long as whatever hatches doesn’t try to put a xenomorph in us. www.avclub.com/... Noah Hawley on Alien TV series: No Ripley it's Earth-based and actually capitalism is the real monster https://t.co/8Cv3gqgLIi pic.twitter.com/DdmoLhBfKO   All the premature hand-wringing about the upcoming "socialist" #Alien TV series is bemusing. As if the very first movie didn't focus on blue-collar workers and portray the greedy corporation as the unseen villain. https://t.co/B3i5WyQbKF  @HawleyMO Senator Josh Hawley faced intense criticism from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch's editorial board for pushing former President Donald Trump's "big vote-fraud lie" and leading the Republican effort to overturn the 2020 election thereby undermining American democracy. pic.twitter.com/ED0Rm3BE3R   THIS IS COOL!Buried in a US House spending bill to fund Congress in 2022 is this amendment ordering that a plaque listing the names of all police who protected the Capitol on Jan 6 be hung at "permanent location" on west front of complex Nice pic.twitter.com/To621X7sn8
