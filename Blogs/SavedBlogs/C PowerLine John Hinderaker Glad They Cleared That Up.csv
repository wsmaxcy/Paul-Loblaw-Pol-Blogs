C, Glad They Cleared That Up, John Hinderaker, 2021-05-01, The Rochester Minnesota school board has declared “Black Lives Matter” to be “government speech.” I always suspected something of the sort but it is nice to see it made official: The Rochester Public Schools board voted unanimously Tuesday evening to make several phrases and images including “Black Lives Matter” government speech meaning the school can’t be held liable for allowing those views while not allowing opposing views. Got that? Dissent from the “Black Lives Matter” orthodoxy will not be permitted. The government says so. Several other phrases have been declared “government speech” as well: [I]n Rochester schools speech concerning “Brown lives matter” “Indigenous lives matter “Stop Asian hate” as well as the pride flag are now all declared official government speech. I have to say that the concept of “government speech” is a new one on me. It is quite a few years now since I studied the First Amendment but the idea of declaring an idea to be “government speech” so as to prohibit anything counter to it seems a bit sinister. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
