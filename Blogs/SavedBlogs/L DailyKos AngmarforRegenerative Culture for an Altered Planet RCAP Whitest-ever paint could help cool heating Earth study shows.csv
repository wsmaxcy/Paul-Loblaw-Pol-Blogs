L, RCAP: Whitest-ever paint could help cool heating Earth study shows, AngmarforRegenerative Culture for an Altered Planet, 2021-04-29,  The whitest-ever paint has been produced by academic researchers with the aim of boosting the cooling of buildings and tackling the climate crisis. The new paint reflects 98% of sunlight as well as radiating infrared heat through the atmosphere into space. In tests it cooled surfaces by 4.5C below the ambient temperature even in strong sunlight. The researchers said the paint could be on the market in one or two years. White-painted roofs have been used to cool buildings for centuries. As global heating pushes temperatures up the technique is also being used on modern city buildings such as in Ahmedabad in India and New York City in the US. Currently available reflective white paints are far better than dark roofing materials but only reflect 80-90% of sunlight and absorb UV light. This means they cannot cool surfaces below ambient temperatures. The new paint does this leading to less need for air conditioning and the carbon emissions they produce which are rising rapidly. www.theguardian.com/… -Weather Channel  Parnell said a comparison of the carbon dioxide emitted by the mining of barium sulphate with the emissions saved from lower air conditioning use would be needed to fully assess the new paint. He also said green roofs on which plants grow could be more sustainable where practical. Project Drawdown a charity that assesses climate solutions estimates that white roofs and green roofs could avoid between 600m and 1.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050 roughly equivalent to two to three years of the UK’s total annual emissions.

But that future is NOW. Our leaders are not taking this crisis seriously or taking action and are thus failing us and future generations as well as planet Earth. The end of our present societies means the end of human and animal lives and the potential death of planet Earth. We have little time left to alter our societies governments and to prevent this catastrophe happening. Our Methods: Uses of nonviolent resistance to protest against climate chaos biodiversity loss and total ecological collapse. inspiration from grassroots movements such as Occupy Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement and Extinction Rebellion. To create support worldwide and a sense of urgency to tackle total ecological breakdown. Protest and Direct Action to deal with the inaction of world governments. Making a commitment to saving the planet and trying to create a sustainable Green future for all.  To Join: dailykos.com (GreenRevolution is the Sister Action group to Regenerative Culture.
