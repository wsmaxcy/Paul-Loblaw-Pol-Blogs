L, One Less Insurrectionist To Worry About.  Insurrectionist Dead After Motorcycle Collision., Merlin196357, 2021-07-07, Joseph Cable Barnes of Austin TX who was a Jan 6th insurrectionist was killed in a motorcycle collision.  Normally I wouldn’t want to be seen as cold hearted and judgmental with the death of most people.  But trying to violently overthrow the government and take away my right to vote  qualifies Mr. Barnes as a major asshole in my book. But shouldn’t I be a little more generous with the late Mr. Barnes?  Maybe he was just one of those trying to save muffins or looking for a bathroom? According to the official complaint Barnes was seen on video screaming “This is our house! This is our country! This is our country!” during the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol.  Witnesses were able to identify Barnes to authorities with one saying they visited Barnes at his home multiple times and another confirming that they attended the same high school. Barnes reportedly worked as a commercial real estate agent.  Barnes was arrested by federal authorities in March and charged with the obstruction of official proceedings according to the complaint.  That sounds like a man who was not looking for a bathroom on Jan 6th.  Or trying to save muffins.  Sounds like someone who shoved his way into the Capitol Building. Maybe Mr. Barnes saw the error of his ways?  Maybe he was sorry for trying to violently overthrow the government and block the results of the November Election?  Or maybe not. An online obituary described Barnes as "a patriot and loved our country and those who served to protect our freedom." It added: "He was chivalrous a defender of the underdog and was intimidated by nothing or no one." The obituary also said Barnes "lived life at full throttle" and was "a true Renaissance Man; an avid painter who focused his artistic skill on painting flags." Now Mr. Barnes may or may not have prepared that obituary but it appears that Barnes’ family and/or friends thought his participation in the Jan 6th insurrection were the actions of a “patriot.”  And who did Mr. Barnes think of as an underdog?  Probably white Trump supporters.    It does appear that we can guess Mr. Barnes’ character from the company he kept though.  Whoever wrote this obit for him is a fucking asshole too.  But you know about that “lived life at full throttle” part? The department said officers responded to a call where Barnes who was riding his motorcycle collided with a car after police say he ran a red light.  I do not own a motorcycle.  I only rode on one when I was a kid.  But even I know that you can get into very serious injuries on a motorcycle.  I knew of a coworker who ended up a quadrapalegic because of a motorcycle accident.  My coworker wasn’t running a red light when that tragedy befell him either.   I’m probably not giving Mr. Barnes any credit or due.  Things are not always black and white except that it seems Mr. Barnes viewed his politics in those stark terms.  “This is our country!” is the battle cry nowadays of bigots and racists which is why I am not pulling my verbal punches on the late Mr. Barnes.  And given that right wing extremists are trying to make insurrectionists “heroes” you might understand why I scream “Bullshit!” on the late Mr. Barnes.  Because it sure sounds like his family and friends come from the same cloth as Mr. Barnes and are making him out to be some kind of hero.
