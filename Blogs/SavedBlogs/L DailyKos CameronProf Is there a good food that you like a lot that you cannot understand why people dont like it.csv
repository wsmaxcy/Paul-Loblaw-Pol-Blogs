L, Is there a good food that you like a lot that you cannot understand why people don't like it?, CameronProf, 2021-05-04, I admit it there are some foods that I could survive on for the rest of my life if I had to only eat a certain number of different foods.  Living in a nursing home and being a diabetic at some nursing homes we get a snack around 9 PM and (usually) it is a sammich. I used to like peanut butter and jelly until I have gotten so sick of it if I have no others in my life I would be OK with that. But the one sammich I can never get enough of and I crave when I do not have it is egg salad.  I’ve never had an egg salad product that I do not like. Yet I know from reading prior diaries of mine on here and on the Interwebz in general some people are turned off by even the thought of eating egg salad. I am OK with that since it means more for me. :)  How about you is there a food you really like that you are amazed others do not like?  I admit I have a unique sense of taste. I love jellyfish. eel octopus squid chicken feet….but with those foods I can understand why others might not be into them. But egg salad I do not get it.  How about you? Is there your own food you like that you do not understand why some people do not like it?
