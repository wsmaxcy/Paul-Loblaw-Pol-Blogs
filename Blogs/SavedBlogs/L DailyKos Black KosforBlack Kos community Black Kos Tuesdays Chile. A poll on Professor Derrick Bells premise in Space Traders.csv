L, Black Kos Tuesday's Chile. A poll on Professor Derrick Bell's premise in 'Space Traders', Black KosforBlack Kos community, 2021-06-29, Still wondering how many people would vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù to sending all Black folks off with space aliens Commentary by Black Kos Editor Denise Oliver-Velez I never expected to see The Wall Street Journal featuring a piece on Professor Derrick Bell who is often dubbed ‚ÄúThe Godfather of Critical Race Theory.‚Äù In Bell's most famous tale aliens "make the U.S. government an offer: In exchange for miraculous technologies that can heal the environment and ensure prosperity they demand to carry off the entire Black population of the U.S. in their spaceships." https://t.co/gwYy7pJadK Adam Kirsch writes: In 1971 Bell became the first Black professor to receive tenure at Harvard Law School. As he writes in ‚ÄúFaces‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen I agreed to become Harvard‚Äôs first black faculty member‚Ä¶I did so on the express commitment that I was to be the first but not the last black hired. I was to be the pioneer the trailblazer.‚Äù But the school was slow to hire more Black faculty leading Bell to leave in protest in 1990. He ended up spending the last part of his career at NYU Law School. These experiences inform ‚ÄúFaces at the Bottom of the Well‚Äù which is made up of nine fables some with a science-fiction twist. In one story a new continent emerges in the Atlantic Ocean with an atmosphere that only African-Americans can breathe. In another the U.S. institutes a system where whites can pay for permission to discriminate against Blacks‚Äîa kind of cap-and-trade scheme for bigotry. These far-fetched scenarios allow Bell to explore very real questions about belonging and trust. Are Black people at home in America or should they think of themselves as sojourners in a land that will never belong to them? Is racism a social problem that can be solved or is it a permanent condition like mortality which can only be met with defiance? Not every story in ‚ÄúFaces‚Äù has a dark ending but most do‚Äîespecially the last and most famous ‚ÄúThe Space Traders.‚Äù In this tale aliens arrive on earth and make the U.S. government an offer: In exchange for miraculous technologies that can heal the environment and ensure prosperity they demand to carry off the entire Black population of the U.S. in their spaceships. When a referendum is held on whether to accept the aliens‚Äô offer ‚Äúyes‚Äù wins with 70% of the vote. As a result of right wingnuts latching onto Critical Race Theory (CRT) as their latest hysterical bludgeon to scare whyte people about the coming Black takeover of all things American (they are clueless about CRT ‚Äî but it is ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù...soooooo‚Ä¶) Professor Bell‚Äôs existence has now entered the mainstream arena along with his book of fables ‚ÄúFaces at the Bottom of the Well.‚Äù People who actually studied with Bell are pushing back on social media. Since every white Republican suddenly claims to be an expert on critical race theory I went back and dug up this video from my own critical race theory class with Professor Derrick Bell at Harvard Law School in 1990. pic.twitter.com/2RnssKK9dY When I decided to comment about all of this I googled to look for stories and low and behold I found a post about his ‚Äúspace traders‚Äù fable ‚Äî which to be honest I had forgotten I wrote back in December of 2019 which also included a poll.¬† Would white folks vote yes to deport black Americans? Remembering Derrick Bell's 'The Space Traders' https://t.co/R5Lj2xVfHR I‚Äôll excerpt some of it here ‚Äî to save you from clicking on a link. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Would white folks vote yes to deport black Americans? Remembering Derrick Bell's 'The Space Traders' Growing up during the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s I was an avid fan of speculative science fiction (which I still love today). However as a young black person it was rare to find central characters who were black and plots that related to black history and possible black futures. It was difficult to find me in what I was reading. I read and reread the work of black sci-fi writers such as Samuel ‚ÄúChip‚Äù Delaney and Octavia Butler. Young people today have far more options with the rise of Afrofuturism which is well-covered in Ytasha L. Womack‚Äôs Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture. I thought about this a few weeks ago when I saw this tweet from Jelani Cobb: Derrick Bell's Space Traders and Octavia Butler's Parable series show how brilliant and prescient they both were. Those who ignore them do so at all of our peril.  Some of the responses to it referenced Octavia Butler and Professor Derrick Bell‚Äôs short story ‚ÄúThe Space Traders.‚Äù The blogger Abagond describes ‚ÄúThe Space Traders‚Äù in a post from 2010: ‚ÄúThe Space Traders‚Äù (1992) is a short story written by Derrick Bell science fiction fan and professor of constitutional law. ¬†It is a thought experiment: what if space traders came from another star and offered to buy all the black people in America? It is set in America in the near future: The Space Traders arrive offering: In exchange for:  Here‚Äôs Jelani‚Äôs full Twitter thread: As a way to measure people‚Äôs optimism or pessimism I sometimes ask black people what percentage of white Americans they think would in a completely anonymous ballot vote to deport every last one of us. I expected people to guess 30-40%.The average estimate is around 80... üá∫üá∏  It occurs to me though the really interesting thing would be to ask white people what percentage of white people they believe would anonymously vote to deport every African American in this country.  No I‚Äôm not going to do a twitter poll on this question. That would defeat the purpose. But as a thought exercise I find it really interesting.  For those who don‚Äôt know the reference other people are making the legal scholar Derrick Bell wrote a collection of short stories called Faces at the Bottom of the Well in 1993. It included a story called ‚ÄúThe Space Traders‚Äù in which aliens wanted America‚Äôs black people.  The crux of the story was about whether America would sell black people back into slavery in order to gain riches from these alien creatures. It inspired my question which is not whether white people would do this but what black people think white people would do.  On that note... Happy Thanksgiving!*We should poll Native Americans on the expulsion question next.  One last point: I‚Äôm constantly struck by the fact that Abraham Lincoln thought DEEPLY about deporting black people 200k of whom were fighting on his side in the Civil War. You know who he never considered deporting?The Confederates who were actually trying to kill him  It was interesting reading the responses such as this one: Sounds accurate based on the white people who voted for an overt racist sexist xenophobic moron. pic.twitter.com/LPAOP35BYY  There were objections; there were people who related racism only to Trump voters; and there were a few white people who flipped the story wishing all white folks would be taken instead. Though Cobb decided not to do a poll I‚Äôve included one at the bottom of this piece though it is in no way scientific. I‚Äôm curious about what Daily Kos readers think. For those of you who have never read ‚ÄúThe Space Traders‚Äù ‚Äî here‚Äôs a link to Bell‚Äôs original short story: The Space Traders  The jaw of every one of the welcoming officials dropped not a word of the many speeches they had prepared suitable for the occasion. As the Americans stood in stupefied silence the visitors' leader emphasized that the proposed trade was for the Americans freely to accept or not that no force would be used. Neither then nor subsequently did the leader or any other of the visitors whom anchorpersons on that evening's news shows immediately labeled the "SpaceTraders" reveal why they wanted only black people or what plans they had for them should the United States be prepared to part with that or any other group of its citizens. The leader only reiterated to his still-dumbfounded audience that in exchange for the treasure they had brought they wanted to take away every American categorized as black on birth certificate or other official identification. The Space Traders said they would wait sixteen days for a response to their offer. That is on 17 January-the day when in that year the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. was to be observed-they would depart carrying with them every black man woman and child in the nation and leave behind untold treasure. ‚ÄúThe Space Traders‚Äú was adapted for television in 1994 by director Reginald Hudlin and writer Trey Ellis. It was part of the HBO anthology Cosmic Slop made up of three sci-fi stories told from a black perspective.   If you have not read Bell‚Äôs seminal work Faces at the Bottom of the Well you should.  The classic work on American racism and the struggle for racial justiceIn Faces at the Bottom of the Well civil rights activist and legal scholar Derrick Bell uses allegory and historical example to argue that racism is an integral and permanent part of American society. African American struggles for equality are doomed to fail so long as the majority of whites do not see their own well-being threatened by the status quo. Bell calls on African Americans to face up to this unhappy truth and abandon a misplaced faith in inevitable progress. Only then will blacks and those whites who join with them be in a position to create viable strategies to alleviate the burdens of racism. "Freed of the stifling rigidity of relying unthinkingly on the slogan 'we shall overcome'" he writes "we are impelled both to live each day more fully and to examine critically the actual effectiveness of traditional civil rights remedies."With a new foreword by Michelle Alexander Faces at the Bottom of the Well is urgent and essential reading on the problem of racism in America.  Linda Greenhouse reviewed it for The New York Times: In Derrick Bell's view discourse about race in America is mired in the sugarcoated myth that equality for blacks will be found just around the corner as soon as the country completes its fitful but inevitably progressive journey toward enlightenment and justice. The myth is sweet but ultimately disabling and dangerous he believes because it denies to both blacks and whites understanding of a truth that is almost exactly the opposite: that racism is not a passing phase but a permanent feature of American life and that the path is marked not by real progress but by occasional short-lived judicial or legislative victories that serve to obscure the underlying truth even more. Both in his writing and by his actions Mr. Bell one of the country's most prominent scholars of race and the law has spent years trying to bring this message both to other blacks and to the white-majority institutions in which he has worked. Most notable of these is Harvard Law School where more than 20 years ago he became the first black faculty member to receive tenure. Two years ago he vowed to remain on an unpaid leave until the law school hired a black woman for its tenured faculty. In July Harvard Law School refused to extend his leave for a third year and informed him that his failure to return meant he had relinquished his position on the faculty which still includes no tenured black women. He is currently a visiting professor at New York University Law School. Without directly addressing this episode Mr. Bell's new book "Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism" nonetheless makes it appear not only understandable but almost inevitable. Like his previous book "And We Are Not Saved: The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice" this one approaches his theme indirectly through allegory fables and dialogues with a fictional "lawyer-prophet" a mordantly wise black woman named Geneva Crenshaw whose role is to goad and inspire the professor-narrator to confront the truth without the sugarcoating. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What I am now curious about is how given the upswing of open in your face white supremacy and an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government deeply rooted in racial animus along with a much less acknowledged persistence of racism in segments of the population who dub themselves ‚Äúleft‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal‚Äù readers may (or may not) have changed what they thought back in 2019.¬† This is of course not a scientific poll however I am going to post one anyway. See down below. I admit my thoughts are in line with those of Dr. Bell. He is often portrayed as a pessimist. I think he was actually a realist.¬† ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Black Voters Matter bus tour marks 60 years since the Freedom Ride and eight years Shelby County v. Holder was decided in a blow to voter access. The voting rights bus tour kicked off June 19 in Jackson Mississippi where many Freedom Riders were arrested 60 years ago when they got off the bus there. The tour which also included stops in Alabama Georgia South Carolina North Carolina West Virginia and Tennessee aimed to travel the reverse route of the 1961 Freedom Rides. On the side of the bus are the words: "Freedom Ride The Fight Continues" "Power" and "Love" along with the images of the original Freedom Riders a group of white and Black activists that included college students and middle-aged Americans. This week's eight-day trip came during a week of action involving voting rights. Earlier this week the Senate failed to pass a measure to start debate on a sweeping voting rights bill. The ‚ÄúFor the People Act‚Äô‚Äô backed by Democrats would among other things allow same-day voter registration and expand early voting. Republicans argued it was overreaching. ‚ÄúThis is game day‚Äô‚Äô LaTosha Brown co-founder of Black Voters Matter told USA TODAY in an interview Friday aboard one of the buses. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the fork in the road where we will either go down the road of peril as it relates to democracy or we‚Äôre going to go down the road of great possibilities and promise.‚Äù Yale professor and author of ‚ÄúHow Fascism Works?‚Äù Jason Stanley¬†tweeted ‚ÄúHistory shows that propaganda can make a dominant group mad with panic and fear about the threat of a small minority subjugating them supposedly by seizing the institutions and doing things to their children.‚Äù I‚Äôve been thinking about this tweet a lot lately as I watch the ongoing moral panic across the country about critical race theory (CRT).¬†Florida¬†banned¬†CRT¬†and the 1619 Project in teaching history. Texas Governor¬†Greg Abbott¬†signed a¬†‚Äú1836 Project‚Äù¬†bill to promote ‚Äúpatriotic education‚Äù and the state‚Äôs exceptionalism. Idaho¬†banned¬†CRT¬†in schools¬†and set up an¬†‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù task force¬†while according to the¬†AP a conservative group in Nevada suggested¬†teachers wear body cameras¬†to ensure they aren‚Äôt teaching¬†CRT. Aside from how these bans are affronts to academic freedom and free speech¬†CRT¬†is by no stretch of the imagination taught widely in grade school or high school. This panic is the product of conservative media scaring by parents over what their kids are learning in school about¬†U.S.¬†history. The most central and most controversial claim is that¬†CRT¬†teaches self-hate to white kids. Though I disagree with this idea on its face I also don‚Äôt think the recounting of history is inherently supposed to make anyone feel good. That isn‚Äôt the mission of education nor does it promote critical thinking. But what frustrates me the most about all of this is I can‚Äôt imagine that the average parent linking¬†CRT¬†to ‚Äúself-hate‚Äù has ever stopped to consider the messages past and current curriculums send to Black children.  We live in a country where our education systems often condenses the African-American experience as a journey from whitewashed versions of slavery to the ‚ÄúI Have A Dream‚Äù speech. In the service of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù we already subject children or all races to ‚Äúgood master happy slave‚Äù narratives the Disney-version of colorblind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or Black History Months that begin and end with the Civil Rights Movement.  Racism may¬†often run deep but one of the most depressing things about it is how superficial it really is. In most parts of the world it is literally a matter of black and white. A person‚Äôs skin colour however has little biological significance. It is merely a balance between defending the lower layers of the dermis from cancer-causing ultraviolet light (which favours dark skin) and promoting the beneficial role of ultraviolet in the synthesis of vitamin D (which favours light skin). The farther someone‚Äôs ancestors lived from the equator the paler their skin evolved to be. Go back far enough though and everyone‚Äôs ancestors lived in Africa the continent where¬†Homo sapiens¬†originated. Most non-Africans alive today trace the bulk of their ancestry to Africans who burst forth on an unprepared world about 60000 years ago. Indeed the oldest representative of the species yet found in Britain retained the dark skin of his African forebears. Africa is where humanity grew up‚Äîand where the bulk of human genetic diversity is found to this day. Only now is a serious effort beginning to explore Africa‚Äôs genetic richness. Better late than never. The¬†Three Million African Genomes (3mag) project a continent-wide endeavour proposes to do for the place what has already been done for Europe North America and parts of Asia‚Äînamely to catalogue and analyse the genetic diversity of those who live there. That will be scientifically fascinating for it will help elucidate how¬†H. sapiens¬†evolved. But it will be medically important too. It may even help erode that black-and-white excuse for racism. Genetic diversity brings with it diversity of genetic disease. Cystic fibrosis‚Äîin any case rarer in Africa than in Europe‚Äîis often caused there by a different mutation from the one involved in the European version and is thus missed by tests developed in the West. A mutation responsible in Ghana for 40% of inherited deafness is unknown in South Africa. And so on. It also brings a diversity of genetic response to disease. Some of the molecular details of the immune system for example vary with geography. Understanding that variation in Africa will improve understanding of immunity to infection helping Africans and non-Africans alike. Jordan Crowley was born with only one shrunken kidney to clean his blood. As he gets older his one kidney gets sicker. Jordan is now 18 loves dogs and is more interested in telling me about his college classes than the fact that he was recently hospitalized for seizures a complication of his illness. He‚Äôll need a kidney transplant soon. He would be closer to getting that kidney transplant if only he were categorized as white. A patient‚Äôs level of kidney disease is judged by an estimation of glomerular filtration rate or eGFR which normally sits between 90 and 120 in a patient with two healthy kidneys. In the United States patients can‚Äôt be¬†listed¬†for a kidney transplant until they‚Äôre deemed sick enough‚Äîuntil their eGFR dips below a threshold of 20. Jordan is biracial with one Black grandparent and three white ones. His estimated GFR depends on how you interpret this fact: A white Jordan has a GFR of 17‚Äîlow enough to secure him a spot on the organ waitlist. A Black Jordan has a GFR of 21. Jordan‚Äôs doctors decided he is Black meaning he doesn‚Äôt qualify. So now he has to wait. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ After a year in which demands for racial justice acquired new resonance Spriggs and others are pushing back against a strongly held tenet of economics: that differences in wages largely reflect differences in skill. While African Americans lag behind whites in educational attainment that disparity has narrowed substantially over the last 40 years. Still the wage gap hasn‚Äôt budged. In 2020 the typical full-time Black worker earned about 20% less than a typical full-time white worker. And Black men and women are far less likely than whites to have a job. So the median earnings for Black men in 2019 amounted to only 56 cents for every dollar earned by white men. The gap was wider than it was in 1970. Black workers also earn lower wages relative to their credentials. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute a liberal think tank found that whether they have a high school diploma or an advanced degree Black workers make about 80% of the earnings of a white worker with similar education. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in denial that education matters but I am pushing back on the extent that it matters‚Äù said Darrick Hamilton a professor of economics at the New School in New York. ‚ÄúThe fact is there are a limited number of jobs and we sort them based on power. Race is a deciding factor.‚Äù Consider information technology which offers some of the best-paid jobs in the country. African Americans earn around 1 in 10 bachelor‚Äôs degrees in computer science nationwide. By contrast they account for only 2.6 of every 100 computer workers in the region around San Francisco including Silicon Valley. Even with the credentials that many African Americans have in the field Spriggs said in an interview ‚ÄúSilicon Valley says ‚ÄòYeah but they are not skilled.‚Äô‚Äù NBC spoke to Erick Louis the TikToker who posted the¬†original video¬†that helped the strike movement gain traction on the app. To him the issue is not that white creators are replicating the choreography created by Black users but it‚Äôs more of a matter of giving ‚Äúcredit where it‚Äôs due.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt just speaks volumes. We have these experiences outside of TikTok. As Black folks we‚Äôre used to galvanizing marching protesting having to scream and yell to have our voices heard. It‚Äôs weird that it‚Äôs also having to be translated onto a space where people are supposed to divulge their creative endeavors and engage creatively‚Äù Louis said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs supposed to be a safe space but even in those spaces we‚Äôre forced to make a statement and protest.‚Äù TikTok released a statement to NBC saying in part that the app‚Äìwhich is among the top of the most downloaded and used social media platforms¬†in the world‚Äìis a ‚Äúspecial place because of the diverse and inspiring voices of our community and our Black creators are a critical and vibrant part of this.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm‚Äù the spokesperson said. That‚Äôs all fine and dandy but based on what‚Äôs happening now with the dance strike and also with previous attempts by Black creators to draw attention to the app‚Äôs habit of¬†suppressing their voices in the past it seems like there‚Äôs still some¬†work that TikTok needs to do¬†in order to truly make it a place where Black creators can thrive and get their coins just as¬†Addison Rae¬†and them folks have. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
