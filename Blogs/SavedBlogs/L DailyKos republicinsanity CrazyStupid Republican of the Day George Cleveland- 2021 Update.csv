L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: George Cleveland- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-04-29, On this date in 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 as well as 2020 “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” published profiles of George Cleveland from the North Carolina House of Representatives who we still think looks like Carl from Pixar’s “Up” but is decidedly far less lovable in our eyes. Cleveland has been allowed to run for office virtually unopposed in every election since 2002 and while he has missed a large percentage of the votes in the North Carolina House he has turned up for some of the most notorious pieces of legislation to cross the desk of North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory. Cleveland has supported the state constitution having a ban on same sex marriage blocked minimum wage increases restricted early voting blocked the Medicaid Expansion in the Tar Heel State and voted for the notorious “motorcycle safety” bill that through amendments put forth by Republicans became one of the harshest anti-abortion laws in the country. Cleveland also has gone to the floor of the North Carolina House to pitch ideas for illegal immigration like profiling potential undocumented immigrants based on what they’re wearing tried forcing the owner of the North Carolina State Fair to allow people to carry guns at the event against his wishes and once argued that there aren’t actually any people who are extremely poor in North Carolina it’s just an illusion created by statisticians who redefine what poverty is (for the record 8% of North Carolina lives in extreme poverty and 17.5% live below the poverty line in total).George Cleveland was one of several North Carolina Republicans who reacted to South Carolina’s state legislature removing the Confederate flag from state grounds in the wake of the mass murder at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston by instead voting for SB 22 to make it HARDER to remove Confederate iconography from around the state.Cleveland also supported two pieces of legislation that were created by the North Carolina GOP to stick it to the LGBTQ community voting for SB 2 a bill aimed at allowing for state officials to refuse to perform marriage duties based on their “sincerely held religious beliefs” and sponsoring the now-infamous disaster that is HB 2 which isn’t just written to force people to use bathrooms according to the sex they were born as but it was written to specifically allow people of “religious faith” to use it as a justification to discriminate against the gay community in North Carolina.He was of course one of many North Carolina Republicans who responded to the loss in the governor’s race by Republican incumbent Pat McCrory by trying to supplant democracy by stripping many of the main powers of governance away from incoming Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Cleveland followed that up by co-sponsoring a bill with fellow CSGOPOTD Michael Speciale and Larry Pittman  of the North Carolina state legislature to attempt to eliminate the prohibition on seceding from the United States that was written into the North Carolina state constitution after the Civil War to reiterate the fact that the Tar Heel State should totally not do something that stupid ever again. Well George Cleveland wants the option to start another American Civil War back on the table apparently.Cleveland won re-election in 2018 after surviving the GOP Primary with but 52% of the vote and then won with 58% of the vote in the general election. For those keeping track George Cleveland is now just shy of his 82nd birthday and in recent years has co-sponsored legislation to ban abortion at not just 20… but 13 weeks and the completely over-the-top anti-choice bill known as the “Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act”.  Oh and lest we forget he also voted against extending the statute of limitations on child abuse cases because he apparently would like molesters to still have a better chance of getting away with their crimes.Cleveland won re-election in 2020 with 60% of the vote and immediately sought to work to limit the ability of Gov. Roy Cooper to continue state-of-emergency orders co-sponsoring a bill to limit such orders to a 30 day window and past that requiring approval from the state legislature. Because heaven forbid any governor keep mask mandates in order during a pandemic to save lives.
