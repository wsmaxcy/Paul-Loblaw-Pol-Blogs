C, Blackouts: Coming to a Neighborhood Near You?, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-30, California and Texas have both experienced extensive blackouts during the past year with multiple fatalities in Texas. Why? Might blackouts come to your state? Are we entering an era of unreliable energy? If you want answers to these questions I recommend tuning in to a webinar tomorrow featuring Isaac Orr one of the nation’s top energy experts and Brent Bennett of the Texas Public Policy Foundation. The webinar will begin at noon Central. You can sign up for it here. If you want a preview of the explanation for the Texas blackouts or if you can’t make the webinar you can get the details here. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
