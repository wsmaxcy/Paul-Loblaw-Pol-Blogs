C, J.P. Sears on the Woke Military, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-20, J.P. Sears has established himself alongside the Babylon Bee as one of the primary assets in the War against Woke. Here he takes on wokery in the military:  Best line: “Today we’re replacing hand-to-hand combat training with hand-holding training.” Runner up: “Women who can’t lift as much are just as strong as men who can lift more.” The sad part is this might be a documentary rather than satire. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
