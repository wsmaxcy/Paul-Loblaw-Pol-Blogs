L, Sen. Marsha Blackburn Mocked For Griping About Funding Elder Care, David Moye, 2021-04-07, The Republican Party’s opposition to President Joe Biden’s proposed infrastructure plan is pushing GOP politicians into taking some bizarre positions in an attempt to own the libs. Case in point: Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn who on Wednesday took to Twitter to gripe about various parts of the plan. Considering Blackburn is a conservative it’s no surprise she opposed funding climate change studies and green transportation initiatives but she shocked many by revealing she also has problems with helping the country’s oldest citizens many of whom vote Republican﻿. President Biden’s proposal is about anything but infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/fRtbPqg7QK Paying lip service to helping older Americans is Politics 101 so naturally many Twitter users were shocked by the tweet which was quickly overwhelmed with negative comments. The Democratic National Committee was quick to point out what Blackburn was saying. Republicans in Congress are now opposed to elder care. https://t.co/UjHmz30TGQ Others piled on with the mockery. the senator from Tennessee would like to make sure the 1 million+ seniors she represents know that she literally opposes caring for them https://t.co/uBtmlv7zss Yeah to hell with the elderly! Boo seniors! BOO!!!! I’m a one issue voter and that issue is “Old people should die in Dickensian poorhouses” https://t.co/kRtMn0T5f4 The audacity of spending money on elder care https://t.co/7NSbQcJDnV Biden Derangement Syndrome is when GOP brains become so broken by the president's very popular policies that their negative messaging ends up converging with Dem positive messaging. https://t.co/kELUeaWMFd This is like a Biden jedi mind trick — Republicans’ message is that Democrats are fighting too hard for America’s seniors. https://t.co/EhYHQ3b4G6 Blackburn’s tweet was so out of touch that some people suspected she was secretly in cahoots with the White House. Did the Biden administration pay Marsha for this tweet? https://t.co/0e2tS109xT One thing I've been worried about is that the Biden team is cramming so much popular stuff into its bills that it might be hard to get the message out it's nice of Senate Republicans to help out. https://t.co/4V0fM8jvSW However one person had some advice for Blackburn and her fellow Republicans. "Screw you seniors!" doesn't seem like a great political strategy https://t.co/IJakc4X4lb
