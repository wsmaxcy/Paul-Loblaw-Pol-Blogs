L, BWAHAHAHA GETTR dumb because previous guy teases 2024 run again to distract you, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-07-01,  Previous guy teases 2024 run again because it could be the only way to stay out of prison. Despite knowing the value of his griftable promises has previous guy offered a 2024 pardon to Weisselberg? And on the grifting front Trump touts yet another social media platform in light of his absence on the bot-happy Twitter.  GETTR is PARLER with a larger financial stake for previous guy and his minions recalling that the latter refused an attempt by Trump to take a major stake in it. It also is an even more pathetic attempt to mimic Twitter only with even more shady security measures.  It is guo/bannon/miller nothing to do with Trump. It was originally the getome app launch by the guo network on 5/10/21 they just changed the name to gettr.  The name GETTR was inspired by the words “Getting Together.” Posts will be 777 characters long the app will host videos up to three minutes in length and will also be capable of hosting livestreams the person working on the app said. Headquarters for the app are located in New York. GETTR’s user interface appears similar to that of Twitter. Initial promotional materials for GETTR on the app stores displayed posts of users celebrating the House of Representatives no longer requiring masks on the floor of the chamber. Initial trending topics on the app included the hashtags “#trump” “#virusorigin” “#nra” and “#unrestrictedbioweapon.” Those tags refer to the newfound and still unproven refrain from Republicans that China created the Covid-19 virus in a lab as a bioweapon. But the similarities with Twitter don’t end there. GETTR’s app also claims to offer new users the ability to “import copies of your content from Twitter to GETTR.” And evidence on the site indicates that the new platform is also allowing users to import their actual Twitter followers — who somehow end up with GETTR accounts of their own. www.politico.com/...

Trump’s answer comes days after he held his first post-presidential rally in Ohio where he talked about the “catastrophe” of the Biden administration.  thehill.com/…  Bob Ney:  This is going to take some twists & turns. Although Trump wasn't indicted yet at this time--Weisselberg was--they were still talking about things Trump did.  Some of it is tax oriented. @bobney   Jason Miller CEO of GETTR served as a senior advisor to President Donald J.Trump.
