L, It's Official: Trump And Allies Acted As Russian Assets During 2020 Election Cycle, NewsHound Ellen, 2021-03-17, Donald Trump Sen. Ron Johnson and plenty of their cronies have some ‘splaining to do about why their 2020 campaign rhetoric and actions fit so perfectly with Putin’s designs thanks to the revelations in a newly-declassified intelligence report. The report does not explicitly state that Trump and Russia used the same messaging or tactics. But no one familiar with Trump’s tactics or what was seen nightly on Fox News could miss the implications. For example from the report: A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of people linked to Russian intelligence to launder influence narratives including misleading allegations against President Biden through U.S. media organizations U.S. officials and prominent U.S. individuals some of whom were close to former President Trump and his administration.…The primary effort the intelligence community uncovered revolved around a narrative that Russian actors began spreading as early as 2014 alleging corrupt ties between President Biden his family and other U.S. officials and Ukraine.  Sound familiar?  MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace connected the dots between Trump’s 2019 effort to get dirt on Biden from the president of Ukraine (the subject of Trump’s first impeachment) and Russia's already-ongoing smear campaign of the same subject. Guest Frank Figliuzzi former FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence explained the larger seriousness of the report. And also it wasn't just that Russia at Putin's direction with Putin's knowledge was directing and supporting a campaign to back Trump. That would be bad enough. But they were doing it - part and parcel of that campaign was to go after Joe Biden and his family. It was a scorched-earth no-holds-barred we're going after his family we're going to besmirch him we're going to denigrate him. This is you know you talk about dirty politics - this is dirty geopolitics on a national and national security level.  ... [The 2020 election] was a narrow victory. There's no rest for the weary because this doesn't stop with this. It will keep coming. It is the new battlefield.  And then secondly all of the people who just regurgitated every day and every night and by the way still do it every night on cable television this mantra of Russian propaganda they're not just liars now. Now we have to call them what they are. They are Russian assets when they regurgitate the lies that they know come from the Russian intelligence service. Wallace noted that Konstantin Kilimnik (a key figure in the Mueller investigation) appeared in this latest report as having taken steps to damage U.S. ties to Ukraine denigrate Biden and his candidacy and benefit Trump’s prospects for re-election.  She also noted that much of the same propaganda “came out of the mouths of American members of Congress” during Trump’s first impeachment trial. “Should we go back and trace the puppeting or the puppet strings being pulled between Russian disinformation and the things said by American members of Congress?” she asked. Figliuzzi thinks we should. He called for getting out the facts and “getting some sunshine on this so that it doesn’t happen again or at least we mitigate the risk.” He explained that the report reveals Russia’s goals and operation are bigger than just the 2020 election: Wallace named two other names:  Andriy Derkach and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). The report described Derkach as a Russia-tied Ukrainian legislator who played “a prominent role in Russia's election influence activities.” The report also assessed that Putin had “purview” over Derkach’s activities.  Johnson you may recall led the Senate investigation into Hunter Biden last year. Although he has denied receiving information from Derkach and laughably claimed not to know who he is the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Johnson “repeatedly cited information provided by Ukrainian official Andriy Telizhenko” as part of an effort to discredit Biden. Then in January the Trump administration sanctioned Telizhenko and named him as part of a Russia-linked foreign-influence network associated with Derkach. Figliuzzi didn’t mince words about Johnson’s complicity: And it's going to continue Nicolle. It's not just this. Understand that even as we speak Russia and its intelligence services are trying to undermine what we think about the COVID vaccine. This just keeps going and so when you see people questioning the effectiveness of the vaccine you've got to go “Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Haven't I -- haven't I seen that in some Russian propaganda campaign?” This is part of our continuing coverage of the 2020 elections.
