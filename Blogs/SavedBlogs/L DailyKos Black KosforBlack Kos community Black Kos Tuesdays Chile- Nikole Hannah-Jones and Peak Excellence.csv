L, Black Kos Tuesday's Chile- Nikole Hannah-Jones and Peak Excellence, Black KosforBlack Kos community, 2021-07-06, Nikole Hannah-Jones and Peak Excellence Commentary by Chitown Kev Earlier today Project Creator for “The 1619 Project” and Pulitzer Prize-winning staff reporter for The New York Times Magazine Nikole Hannah-Jones announced that she was turning down an opportunity to teach journalism as a tenured faculty member in the journalism school at her alma mater The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Instead Hannah-Jones has accepted a position as Inaugural Knight Chair in Race and Reporting at Howard University. Hannah-Jones will be joined by National Book Award winner (Between the World and Me) Ta-Nehisi Coates. Hannah-Jones’s decision comes after a protracted dispute with UNC in which she was initially the first Black Knight Chair to be denied full professorship and tenure at UNC’s Hussman School of Journalism and Media; an event that Hannah-Jones described in an interview with CBS This Morning’s Gayle King as “embarrassing.” Kossack randallt has a diary posted that gives much of the chronology of the Hannah-Jones tenure proceedings at North Carolina. Hannah-Jones has also released her own statement concerning those proceedings from the beginning to the end of her tenure process. That “embarrassing” part though. In her interview with King Hannah-Jones describes being on a track beginning in her pre-collegiate years of constantly competing in elite white settings.  The experience according to her also helped her solidify her decision to work at a historically Black institution. "Since the second grade when I started being bussed into White schools I've spent my entire life proving that I belonged in elite White spaces that were not built for Black people... To have that position and appointment mutilated because of...politics of the ugliest and most racist and sexist kind. It’s embarrassing and humiliating by design. And all racism and sexism directed at a individual is directed at a community; is yes directed at all black people but it is also very personal. And I don’t think that most white people really get the personal part. Knowing that it’s all systemic that when it happens to you...it is personal. The other part that strikes me is Hannah-Jones’s decision to take up Howard University on their offer a decision that Gayle King specifically asked Hannah-Jones. "One of my few regrets in life is that I didn't go to Howard as an undergraduate and I have long wanted to be a part of the Howard family. It's just so clear this is the right thing for me to do at this moment" she said.  37 years ago as a high school senior I had more college acceptance letters than I expected to receive (given my low grade point average). One of those acceptance letters was from Howard University and there were family members urging me to take Howard up on their offer. I declined and matriculated to another HBCU that was so ill-fitting for me that I dropped out after a semester. Howard (along with Morehouse College and Spelman College) simply holds that place in the minds of many Black kids. (Granted I don’t think that a HBCU is for everyone.) I too regret my decision not to go to Howard although at the same time I think that I respect why I made the decision that I did (East Lansing MI was too close to home I had family in DC and I wanted to stay away from family was the main factor). Let’s be for real: Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ta-Nehisi Coates are at the peak of their profession they are among the absolute best in their field and...hell I could be persuaded 37 years later to bury my regret once and for all time with peak excellence at the helm. MAYBE. And I am delighted that others high school seniors or even entering graduate students will get a chance to study under peak excellence at the preeminent Black university should they choose. On the Fourth of July in 1970 six American artists declared independence in an Echo Park loft in Los Angeles. The occasion was the opening night of an exhibition devoted exclusively to the work of Black women—which is now considered by art historians to be the first of its kind in L.A. and probably in the U.S. The show was organized quickly by the artists themselves in response to another L.A. showcase of Black art backed by a corporate sponsor (the Carnation Company) and overwhelmingly focussed on men. The women called their event the “Sapphire Show” after a character in “Amos ’n Andy”—the shrewish know-it-all Sapphire Stevens—transforming a racist and sexist stereotype of women into an avatar of feminist revolution just as one of the show’s best-known participants the magnificent Betye Saar would do two years later in her assemblages when she began arming Aunt Jemima figurines with rifles. Today the “Sapphire Show” represents both a milestone and an unsolved mystery. It may be hard to imagine in the Instagram age but no photographs of the exhibition exist nor is there any written record of what was on view. The only known paper trail is housed in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian: a copy of a flyer announcing the show. Its design is echt seventies using more fonts than the exhibition had artists and features photographs of the six artists from grinning baby pictures to pensive head shots. The list of the artists—Eileen Abdulrashid (now Eileen Nelson) Gloria Bohanon Sue Irons (now Senga Nengudi) Suzanne Jackson Yvonne Cole Meo and Saar—misspells one name (“B. Sarr”) suggesting the haste with which things came together. The flyer also takes a lighthearted dig at corporate culture and its cynical exploitation of the women’s movement borrowing the tagline of a cigarette advertisement: “You’ve come a long way baby.” The “Sapphire Show” was installed for six days at Gallery 32 thanks to a serendipitous gap in the gallery’s schedule; the experimental space was run by Jackson in her painting studio. Jackson now based in Savannah Georgia was then a twenty-six-year-old student of the influential African American artist Charles White at the Otis Art Institute. She had a parallel life as a dancer: professionally trained in pre-statehood Alaska where she grew up she had performed in South America on a tour organized by the State Department before arriving in L.A. (Jackson later also became an accomplished stage-set designer.) She wasn’t interested in a career as a gallerist but sometimes artists need to make their own luck. Her guiding principle might be summed up by Shirley Chisholm’s famous line: “If they don’t give you a seat at the table bring a folding chair”—or in this case sign a lease. A promotional event for a book examining the role slavery played leading up to the Battle of the Alamo that was scheduled at the Bullock Texas State History Museum on Thursday evening was abruptly canceled three and a half hours before it was scheduled to begin. Authors of the book titled “Forget the Alamo” and the publisher Penguin Random House say the cancellation of the event which had 300 RSVPs amounts to censorship from Republican elected leaders and an overreaction to the book’s examination of racism in Texas history. “The Bullock was receiving increased pressure on social media about hosting the event as well as to the museum’s board of directors (Gov Abbott being one of them) and decided to pull out as a co-host all together” Penguin Random House said in a statement. Gov. Greg Abbott and the museum have not responded to the Tribune’s requests for comment. But Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick confirmed he called for the event to be canceled. Abbott Patrick and other GOP leaders are board members of the State Preservation Board which oversees the Bullock museum. “As a member of the Preservation Board I told staff to cancel this event as soon as I found out about it” he wrote on Twitter.” This fact-free rewriting of TX history has no place @BullockMuseum.” Chris Tomlinson one of the book’s three authors shot back on Twitter. Lt. Gov Dan Patrick takes credit for oppressing free speech and policing thought in Texas. @BullockMuseum proves it is a propaganda outlet. As for his fact-free comment well a dozen people professional historians disagree. #ForgettheAlamo #txlege https://t.co/SrKwpzb2HT https://t.co/jlIfZ6NSt5  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Environmentalists and activists claimed victory Saturday after a company canceled plans to build an oil pipeline through southwest Tennessee and north Mississippi and over an aquifer that provides drinking water to 1 million people. Byhalia Connection said it will no longer pursue plans to build a 49-mile underground artery that would have linked two major U.S. oil pipelines while running through wetlands and under poor predominantly Black neighborhoods in south Memphis. A joint venture between Valero and Plains All American Pipeline Byhalia Connection had said the pipeline would bring jobs and tax revenue to the region — and it had given to Memphis-area charities and tried to build goodwill in the community. But in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday Byhalia Connection said it was canceling the project “due to lower U.S. oil production resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.” “We value the relationships we’ve built through the development of this project and appreciate those that supported the project” Byhalia Connection’s statement said. According to a 2018 study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative that looked at the gender race and ethnicity of critics reviewing 100 top domestic films of 2017 — nearly 20000 reviews in all — 82 percent of the critics were white (non-Hispanic) and nearly 78 percent were male. And nearly 90 percent of those considered “top critics” were white. Critic jobs are so scarce and so sought after those who are fortunate enough to land one tend to keep it as long as possible which means the statistics likely haven’t changed much even five years after the Annenberg report particularly when looking at staff positions. “Technically anyone could be a critic but not everyone could be a critic” freelance film critic and writer Robert Daniels told me by phone from Chicago. The internet has democratized the sharing of opinions on any given cultural work. Virtually anyone can express their perspectives on art via Twitter Letterboxd Medium Substack their own website or any number of other forums. The question now isn’t so much who gets to be a critic but rather which critics among a roaring choir of ideas will have an impact on the larger cultural conversation. Though he has found success as a freelancer with bylines at big-name outlets Daniels who is Black started his career by launching a self-run website: 812 Film Reviews. As he points out staff writers at those big-name outlets are predominantly white and since major films are rarely assigned to freelancers the initial consensus about a film comes from those reviewers on staff. Having his own outlet allows him to weigh in too. South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma ordered to surrender himself to start a 15-month jail term for contempt on said Sunday he would not be doing so by the court-set deadline. "No need for me to go to jail today" he told journalists at his Nkandla homestead in Kwa-Zulu Natal province where hundreds of his supporters are camped outside in solidarity. "They cannot accept papers and expect me to show up in prison" he added referring to his legal bid to challenge the sentence. The former president 79 earlier told supporters his "constitutional rights were abused" by judges of the country's constitutional court. He was sentenced to the jail term for contempt of court after he repeatedly refused to give evidence to corruption investigators. His supporters have vowed to render South Africa ungovernable if he is jailed. After sentencing Zuma the South African court nonetheless agreed to hear his challenge to rescind the order. The deadline to surrender himself to the authorities was set to run out on Sunday. Gunmen have kidnapped 140 children from a boarding school in north-western Nigeria a school official has said in the latest in a wave of mass abductions targeting schoolchildren and students. Heavily armed criminal gangs in north-west and central Nigeria often attack villages to loot steal cattle and abduct people for ransom but since the start of the year have increasingly targeted schools and colleges. The attackers opened fire and overpowered security guards after storming the Bethel Baptist high school in Kaduna state in the early hours of Monday abducting most of the 165 pupils boarding there overnight. “The kidnappers took away 140 students only 25 students escaped. We still have no idea where the students were taken” said Emmanuel Paul a teacher at the school. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
