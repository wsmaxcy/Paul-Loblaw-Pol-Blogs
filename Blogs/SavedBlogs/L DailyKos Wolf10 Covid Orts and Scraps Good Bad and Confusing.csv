L, Covid Orts and Scraps: Good Bad and Confusing, Wolf10, 2021-07-01,  Anyone who doubts the #DeltaVariant wave is coming only needs to look at Israel🇮🇱 and UK🇬🇧—two of the most heavily vaccinated countries in the world. Hospitalizations are increasing ⬆️ in both countries too. US🇺🇸 is ~1 month behind UK—but US vaccinations are slowly. #COVID19 🧵 pic.twitter.com/9LXAONCzzK  Prevention and Attenuation of Covid-19 with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines NEJM. From the Abstract: “We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 3975 health care personnel first responders and other essential and frontline workers…. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 participants (5%) of whom 5 were fully vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 2) 11 partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2) and 156 unvaccinated; the 32 participants with indeterminate vaccination status (<14 days after dose 1) were excluded.... Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection the mean viral RNA load was 40% lower (95% CI 16 to 57) in partially or fully vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants.” The load is not zero then.  Illinois summer camp didn’t require masks indoors. Over 80 teens staff got COVID-19 USA Today More than 80 teens and adult staff have tested positive for COVID-19 after attending a summer camp in central Illinois that did not require masks indoors or vaccination status. Of the 85 people infected about 70% of the cases were in those not vaccinated according to a press release from the Illinois Department of Health on Monday. "The perceived risk to children may seem small but even a mild case of COVID-19 can cause long-term health issues" IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said in the release. CDC director: Vaccinated people ‘safe’ from delta variant do not need to wear masks The Hill Thanks but no thanks I’ll keep wearing my mask.  Inside the risky bat-virus engineering that links America to Wuhan MIT Technology Review This would appear to bring into question previous dominant narratives.  Links above purloined from Naked Capitalism  And now for what might be good news: AI technology identifies 160 possible new drug treatments for COVID-19 Health Europa Researchers from the University of Cambridge’s Milner Therapeutics Institute and Gurdon Institute looked at proteins to determine which of these are linked to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. By doing so they were able to determine potential drug treatments for COVID-19. The study used a combination of computational biology and machine learning to create a comprehensive map of proteins that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to examine this network they were able to identify key proteins involved in infection as well as biological pathways that might be targeted by drugs.
