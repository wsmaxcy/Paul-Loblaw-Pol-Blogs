L, AZ Rep. Paul Gosar holding fundraising event with white nationalist Nick Fuentes, Mother Mags, 2021-06-29, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar’s siblings have been telling us for years in political ads they appear in for their brother’s opponents that he is a white supremacist. Gosar put that question to rest in February when he skipped the Covid relief bill vote to keynote Nick Fuentes’ America First Political Action Committee conference. Gosar was the first sitting member of Congress to ever attend an AFPAC event for good reason. Now he’s doubled down teaming up with Fuentes for a July 2 fundraiser.

I’ll say this: there are millions of Gen Z Y and X conservatives. They believe in America First.” In other words there are a lot of racists out there and I’m their man in D.C. That would make sense that the man who boycotted the Pope’s 2015 speech because he mentioned climate change but drove to Nevada to stand with criminal Cliven Bundy against the government does not see what the issue is standing next to a racist who proudly marched at Charlottesville who called the Jan. 6 Capitol riot “awesome” and who’s been banned from YouTube for hate speech. (Gosar still does not believe in climate change.)   Gosar’s name comes up a lot when Jan. 6 is mentioned since he was one of three congressman that the insurrection’s planner Ali Alexander identified as providing aid. Gosar’s possible role in organizing Jan. 6 comes as a surprise to just about no one in Arizona where he was seen at nearly every Stop the Steal event since the election. Here's Congressman Paul Gosar posing for a photo with what appears to be a member of the Proud Boys a known hate group.As a bonus the man on the far left of the photo is wearing a T-shirt for the Oath Keepers an anti-government extremist organization. https://t.co/pcIvbmOB8F When Gosar spoke at Fuentes’s event in February Kevin McCarthy said the GOP should not engage in blowing “nativist dog whistles.” Gosar Marjorie Taylor Greene and other members of the so-called “America First Caucus” aren’t whistling anymore. They’re shouting their racism in the halls of congress. What say you Republican Party?
