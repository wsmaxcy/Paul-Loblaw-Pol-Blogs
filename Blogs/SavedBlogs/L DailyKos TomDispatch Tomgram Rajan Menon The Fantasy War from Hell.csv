It started with three air strikes on September 11 2001. The fourth plane heading perhaps for the Capitol (a building that wouldn’t be targeted again until last January 6th) ended up in a field in Pennsylvania. Those three strikes led to an American invasion of Afghanistan beginning this country’s second war there in the last half-century. Almost 20 years later according to the New York Times there have been more than 13000 U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan. Call that payback after a fashion. There’s only one problem: the greatest military on the planet with a budget larger than that of the next 10 countries combined has visibly lost its war there and is now in full-scale retreat. It may not be withdrawing the last of its forces on May 1st as the Trump administration had agreed to do but despite the pressure of the American military high command President Biden “overrode the brass” and announced that every last American soldier would be gone by the 20th anniversary of those first airstrikes against the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. At this late date consider it grimly fascinating that the generals who all those years kept claiming that “corners” were being turned and “progress” made that we were “on the road to winning” in Afghanistan as the present Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley insisted back in 2013 simply can’t let go of one of their great failures and move on. Under the circumstances don’t for a second assume that the American war in Afghanistan is truly over. For one thing the Taliban have not yet agreed to the new withdrawal date as they did to the May 1st one. Instead some of its commanders are promising a “nightmare” for U.S. troops in the months to come. Were they for instance to attack an air base and kill some American soldiers who knows what the reaction here might be? In addition the Pentagon high command and this country’s intelligence agencies are still planning for possibly making war on Afghanistan from a distance in order to “prevent the country from again becoming a terrorist base.” As Eric Schmitt and Helene Cooper of the New York Times reported recently “Planners at the military’s Central Command in Tampa Fla. and Joint Staff in Washington have been developing options to offset the loss of American combat boots on the ground.” In other words the American war in Afghanistan may be ending but as with so much else about that endless experience even the finale is still up for grabs. In that context consider the thoughts of TomDispatch regular Rajan Menon on what has without any doubt been the American war from hell of this century. Tom On May 1st the date Donald Trump signed onto for the withdrawal of the remaining 3500 American troops from Afghanistan the war there already 19 years old was still officially a teenager.  Think of September 11 2021 — the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and the date Joe Biden has chosen for the same — as in essence the very moment when its teenage years will be over. In all that time Washington has been fighting what in reality should have been considered a fantasy war a mission impossible in that country however grim and bloody based on fantasy expectations and fantasy calculations few of which seem to have been stanched in Washington even so many years later. Not surprisingly Biden’s decision evoked the predictable reactions in that city. The military high command’s never-ending urge to stick with a failed war was complemented by the inside-the-Beltway Blob’s doomsday scenarios and tired nostrums. The latter began the day before the president even went public when in a major opinion piece the Washington Post’s editorial board distilled the predictable platitudes to come: such a full-scale military exit they claimed would deprive Washington of all diplomatic influence and convince the Taliban that it could jettison its talks with President Ashraf Ghani’s demoralized U.S.-backed government and fight its way to power. A Taliban triumph would in turn eviscerate democracy and civil society leaving rights gained by women and minorities in these years in the dust and so destroy everything the U.S. had fought for since October 2001. By this September of course 775000-plus Americans soldiers will have served in Afghanistan (a few of them the children of those who had served early in the war). More than a fifth of them would endure at least three tours of duty there! Suffice it to say that most of the armchair generals who tend to adorn establishment think tanks haven’t faced such hardships. In 2010 and 2011 the Obama surge would deploy as many as 100000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. The Pentagon states that as of this month 2312 American soldiers have died there (80% killed in action) and 20666 have been injured. Then there’s the toll taken on vets of that never-ending war thanks to PTSD suicide and substance abuse. Military families apart however much of the American public has been remarkably untouched by the war since there’s no longer a draft and Uncle Sam borrowed money rather than raising taxes to foot the $2.26 trillion bill. As a result the forever war dragged on consuming blood and treasure without any Vietnam War-style protests. Not surprisingly most Americans know even less about the numbers of Afghan civilians killed and wounded in these years. Since 2002 at least 47000 non-combatants have been killed and another 43000 injured whether by airstrikes artillery fire shootings improvised explosive devices or suicide and car bombings. A 2020 U.N. report on civilian casualties in Afghanistan notes that 2019 was the sixth straight year in which 10000 civilians were killed or wounded. And this carnage has occurred in one of the world’s poorest countries which ranks 187th in per-capita income where the death or incapacitation of an adult male (normally the primary breadwinner in a rural Afghan home) can tip already-poor families into destitution. So how then can the calls to persevere make sense? Seek and you won’t find a persuasive answer. Consider the most notable recent attempt to provide one the Afghanistan Study Group report written by an ensemble of ex-officials retired generals and think-tank luminaries not a few of them tied to big weapons-producing companies. Released with significant fanfare in February it offered no substantive proposals for attaining goals that have been sought for 19 years including a stable democracy with fair elections a free press an unfettered civil society and equal rights for all Afghans — all premised on a political settlement between the U.S.-backed government and the Taliban. Still Standing After All These Years Now consider Afghanistan’s bedrock reality: the Taliban which has battled the world’s most fearsome military machine for two decades remains standing and continues to expand its control in rural areas. The U.S. its NATO allies and the Afghanistan National Security and Defense Forces have indeed killed some 50000 Taliban fighters over the years including in 2016 its foremost leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansoor. In 2019-2020 alone several senior commanders also members of the Taliban’s shadow government were killed including the “governors” of Badakshan Farah Logar Samangan and Wardak provinces. Yet the Taliban whose roots lie among the Pashtun the country’s historically dominant ethnic group have managed to replenish their ranks procure new weapons and ammunition and raise money above all through taxes on opium poppy farming. It helps that the Taliban continues to get covert support from Pakistan’s military and intelligence service which played a pivotal role in creating the movement in the early 1990s after it was clear that the leaders of the Pakistan-backed Pashtun mujahedeen (literally those who wage jihad) proved unable to shoot their way into power because minority nationalities (mainly Uzbeks and Tajiks) resisted ferociously. Yet the Taliban has indigenous roots too and its success can’t be attributed solely to intimidation and violence. Its political agenda and puritanical version of Islam appeal to many Afghans. Absent that it would have perished long ago. Instead according to the Long War Journal the Taliban now controls 75 of Afghanistan’s 400 districts; the government rules 133 others with the remaining 187 up for grabs. Although the insurgency isn’t on the homestretch to victory it’s never been in a stronger military position since the 2001 American invasion. Nor has the morale of its fighters dissipated though many are doubtless weary of war. According to a May U.N. report “the Taliban remain confident they can take power by force” even though their fighters have long been vastly outmatched in numbers mobility supplies transportation and the caliber of their armaments. Nor do they have the jets helicopters and bombers their adversaries especially the United States do and use with devastating effect. In 2019 7423 bombs and other kinds of ordnance were dropped on Afghanistan eight times as many as in 2015. Tallying Costs As 2019 ended a group of former senior U.S. officials claimed that the Afghan campaign’s costs have been overblown. American troops killed there the previous year they pointed out amounted to only a fifth of those who died during “non-combat training exercises” and that “U.S. direct military expenditures in Afghanistan are approximately three percent of annual U.S. military spending” and were decreasing. It evidently escaped them that even a few fatalities that occur because a country’s leaders pursue outlandish objectives like reshaping an entire society in a distant land should matter. As for the monetary costs it depends on what you count.  Those “direct military expenditures” aren’t the only ones incurred year after year from the Afghan War. Brown University’s Costs of War Project for instance also includes expenses from the Pentagon’s “base budget” (the workaday costs of maintaining the armed forces); funds allotted for “Overseas Contingency Operations” the post-9/11 counter-terrorism wars; interest payments on money borrowed to fund the war; the long-term pensions and benefits of its veterans; and economic aid provided to Afghanistan by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Do the math that way and the price tag turns out to be so much larger. But even if you were to accept that 3% figure that would still total $22 billion from the $738 billion fiscal year 2020 Pentagon budget hardly chump change — especially given the resources needed to address festering problems on the home front including a pandemic child poverty hunger homelessness and an opioid epidemic. Nation-Building: Form vs. Substance Now consider some examples of the “progress” highlighted by the proponents of pressing on. These would include democratic elections and institutions less corruption and inroads against the narcotics trade. First the election system an effective one being of course a prerequisite for democracy. Of course given the way Donald Trump and crew dealt with election 2020 here in the U.S. Americans should think twice before blithely casting stones at the Afghan electoral system. In addition organizing elections in a war-ravaged country is a dangerous task when an insurgency is working overtime to violently disrupt them. Still each of Afghanistan’s four presidential elections (2004 2009 2014 2019) produced widespread systematic fraud verified by investigative reporters and noted in U.S. government reports. After the 2014 presidential poll for instance candidate Abdullah Abdullah wouldn’t concede and threatened to form a parallel government insisting that his opponent Ashraf Ghani had won fraudulently. To avert bloodshed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry brokered a power-sharing deal that made Abdullah the “chief executive” — a position unmentioned in the Afghan constitution. (Incidentally elections to the national legislature have also been plagued by irregularities.) Although USAID has worked feverishly to improve election procedures and turnout spending $200 million on the 2014 presidential election alone voting fraud remained pervasive in 2019. As for key political institutions which also bear American fingerprints the respected Afghanistan Analyst Network only recently examined the state of the supreme court the senate provincial and district assemblies and the Independent Commission for Overseeing the Implementation of the Constitution (ICOIC). It concluded that they “lacked even the minimum independence needed to exercise their constitutional mandate to provide accountability” and aggravated the “stagnation of the overall political system.” The senate lacked the third of its membership elected by district assemblies — the remaining senators are appointed by the president or elected by provincial assemblies — for a simple reason. Though constitutionally mandated district assembly elections have never been held. As for the ICOIC it had only four out of its seven legally required commissioners insufficient for a quorum. When it comes to the narcotics trade Afghanistan now accounts for 90% of the world’s illicit opium essential for the making of heroin. The hectares of land devoted to opium-poppy planting have increased dramatically from 8000 in 2001 to 263000 by 2018. (A slump in world demand led to a rare drop in 2019.)  Little wonder since poppies provide destitute Afghan farmers with income to cover their basic needs. A U.N. study estimates that poppy sales at $2 billion in 2019 exceeded the country’s legal exports while the opium economy accounted for 7% to 11% of the gross domestic product. Although the U.S. has spent at least $9 billion attempting to stamp out Afghanistan’s narcotics trade a 2021 report to Congress by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) concluded that the investment had next to no effect and that Afghan dominance of the global opium business remained unrivalled. The report didn’t however mention the emergence of a new more insidious problem. In recent years that country has become a major producer of illegal synthetic drugs especially methamphetamine both cheaper and more profitable than opium cultivation. It now houses according to a European Union study an estimated 500 meth labs that manufacture 65.5 tons of the stuff daily. As for the campaign against corruption a supposed pillar of U.S. nation-building forget it. From shakedowns by officials and warlords to palatial homes built with ill-gotten gains by the well-connected corruption permeates the American-installed system in Afghanistan.   Though U.S. officials have regularly fumed about the corruption of senior Afghan officials including the first post-Taliban president Hamid Karzai the CIA funneled “tens of millions” of dollars to him for years (as he himself confirmed). Investigative reporting by the Washington Post’s Craig Whitlock revealed that many notorious warlords and senior officials were also blessed by the Agency’s beneficence. They included Uzbek strongman and one-time First Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum accused of murder abduction and rape and Mohammed Zia Salehi the head of administration at the National Security Council under President Karzai. In 2015 a U.S. government investigation revealed that $300 million earmarked to pay the Afghan police never actually reached them and was instead “paid” to “ghost” (non-existent) officers or simply stolen by police officials. A 2012 study traced 3000 Pentagon contracts totaling $106 billion and concluded that 40% of that sum had ended up in the pockets of crime bosses government officials and even insurgents. According to SIGAR’s first 2021 quarterly report to Congress one U.S. contractor pled guilty to stealing $775000 in State Department funds. Two others subcontractors to weapons giant Lockheed Martin submitted nearly $1.8 million in fraudulent invoices while hiring local employees who lacked contractually required qualifications.  (They were asked to procure counterfeit college diplomas from an Internet degree mill.) And lest you think that this deeply embedded culture of corruption in Afghanistan is a “Third World” phenomenon consider an American official’s recollection that “the biggest source of corruption” in that country “was the United States.” Hubris and Nemesis Strike — Yet Again While writing this piece a memory came back to me. In 1988 I was part of a group that visited Afghanistan just as Soviet troops were starting to withdraw from that country. After a disastrous 10-year war those demoralized young soldiers were headed for a homeland that itself would soon implode. The Red Army had been sent to Afghanistan in December 1979 by a geriatric Politburo leadership confident that it would save an embattled Afghan socialist regime which had seized power in April 1978 and soon sparked a countrywide Islamist insurgency backed by the CIA and Saudi dollars that spawned a small group that called itself al-Qaeda headed by a rich young Saudi. Once the guerillas were crushed so Soviet leaders then imagined the building of a modern socialist society would proceed amid stability and a shiny new Soviet-allied Afghanistan would emerge. As for those ragtag bands of primitive Islamic warriors what chance did they stand against well-trained Russian soldiers bearing the latest in modern firepower?   Moscow may even have believed that the Kabul government would hold its own after the Soviet military left what its new young leader Mikhail Gorbachev had then taken to calling “the bleeding wound.” The Afghan president of that moment certainly did. When our group met him Mohammed Najibullah Ahmadzai a burly fearsome fellow who had previously headed the KHAD the country’s brutal intelligence agency confidently assured us that his government had strong support and plenty of staying power. Barely four years later he would be castrated dragged behind a vehicle and strung up in public. The Politburo’s experiment in social re-engineering in a foreign country  — no one said “nation-building” back then — led to more than 13000 dead Soviet soldiers and perhaps as many as one million dead Afghans. No two wars are alike of course but the same vainglory that possessed those Soviet leaders marked the American campaign in Afghanistan in its early years. The white-hot anger that followed the 9/11 attacks and the public’s desire for vengeance led the George W. Bush administration to topple the Taliban government. He and his successors in the White House seized by the overweening pride theologian Reinhold Niebuhr had long ago warned his fellow Americans about also believed that they would build a democratic and modern Afghanistan. As it happened they simply started another even longer cycle of war in that unfortunate country one guaranteed to rage on and consume yet more lives after American soldiers depart this September — assuming Biden’s decision isn’t thwarted.
