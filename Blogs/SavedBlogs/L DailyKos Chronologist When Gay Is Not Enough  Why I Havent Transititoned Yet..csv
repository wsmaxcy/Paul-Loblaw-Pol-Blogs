L, When Gay Is Not Enough:  Why I Haven't Transititoned Yet., Chronologist, 2021-04-26, It began with the Queen of Spades.  Even as a very young child I loved playing cards and would watch my grandmother play Klondike (frequently misnamed Solitaire) at night before her bedtime.  I thought cards were beautiful especially Hoyle and carried them around since I was three.  The Queen of Spades was beautiful and something about her just made sense to me.  I wanted to be her.  Truthfully I was only three and I wanted to be her.  It never went away.   I am gay but that’s not what I really am.  I’ve known I was meant to be a woman (despite my mother’s protestations based on her religion and her wishes for the apocalypse) since I was around three or four.  What I mean by that is that in the 80’s and 90’s she raised us to believe that the tribulation was just around the corner so that colored everything we did.  I didn’t even attempt to go to college because of her beliefs until 2001.   For most of my life I was my mother’s subject.  I have very long periods of time in which I wasn’t permitted to go to school partially for my own protection but mostly due to preventing me from embarrassing her.  You see I have autism-spectrum disorder (Aspergers’ diagnosed in 2000 before it was the diagnosis everyone just had to have or even knew about.  From my birth until that therapist tested and diagnosed me I lived in a world of torment because my mother knew what was wrong but denied it try to fight it with Christianity and exorcisms and never told me.  What she told me was that I was insane (and therefore unworthy of love unlike my younger brother) and that the only reason she didn’t ship me off to an institution or a group home (frequently threats) was because she loved me.  I’d already discovered thanks to my grandmother that Mother quit loving me the moment my little brother was born.  If I wasn’t serving the family I had no value to it.   And then there was the gender aspect.  In a safe household one is permitted to eventually ask questions about who they are and what they are to experiment and see what feels right.  In a fundamentalist and emotionally abusive home where screaming and a litany of swearing that would make a sailor blush over the smallest of mistakes many of them having no importance to the screaming mother in question in any real way it’s a different matter.  Within a fundamentalist home where you always know the human hurricane is going to start you just never know where or over what unimportant little matter is going to trigger it biology is destiny.  You’re born with testicles you’re a man as that is what Jesus wants.  Only how can you become a man when you’re raised singly by a woman who hates men and seems to hate and resent your very existence?  I didn’t learn anything about being a woman from her either.  She didn’t want us emulating her.  Instead she demanded we just pick up on how men are supposed to behave — without granting either of us any of the autonomy either growing teenagers or adult men have.  Think of it like being given endless math tests in school when the subject you’re in is English lit. and you haven’t even had first-grade training in math.  And when you fail it’s your fault.   What I did learn about women from her however was how right the feminists were.  She wouldn’t have ever approved of that hating them because Christianity told her to.  Yet I realized that she was what feminism was all about even though I had the good sense never to mention this.  My mother could handle just about anyone and was excellent at her profession.  I thought she could do anything except not scream and swear at the drop of a hat.  Even without her lead I never really cared what other men were doing.  Were I to ask what men or boys were doing I wouldn’t be invited to participate anyway.  That I’d long discovered.  Better to be alone as much as possible.  Books don’t decide they hate you because you know nothing about how to relate to them.  I knew men made me hot but I never dared to mention this to her.  Firstly because we were Christians all sexual feelings were wrong and bad and should be disallowed rebuked and repented of.  But feelings for men?  It was almost irredeemable and yet it kept happening over and over and over.  I haven’t changed any.  I still develop feelings and crushes and moon over men.  What I’ve learned is that since I have no gaydar and tend to pick straights even if I do end up daydreaming and obsessing over a man I must never speak of it to anyone.  Least of all him.   One of the things I learned when I was a teenager was to never admit I liked something.  You see like all autistics I am obsession-tending.  To Mother everything is a sign of Satan so anything that I started to like was swiftly banished from the house.  She didn’t do that to my brother.  Expressing my love for something was the quickest way to see to it that it would be taken away and destroyed.  But it turns out that that’s how it works outside of her control too.  Tell a man I love him and our friendship is over.  Find something I enjoy doing and prepare to watch it die soon.  All things are loss and all roads lead to despair and defeat.  This is inevitable and no picking yourself up and trying again doesn’t eventually get you what you want.  Certainly doesn’t make you stronger.  It just means more sacrifices and more things lost until you eventually have the good sense to do what you should’ve done in the first place; give up on what you want.  It’s why I’m supportive of abortion.  The kindest thing you can do for your children especially children you don’t want or can’t dare have is to spare them from this horrible world before they ever know what pain is.   I am decisively gay but I have always wanted and still want a female body.  This male body doesn’t work for me at all.  Every moment that I am in it feels wrong distorted off-kilter.  My genitals’ mere existence is an embarrassment to me.  I know nothing of maleness except that it’s toxic to everyone involved.  I want to fix it but I am not in a position or state where transitioning would be possible.    Inevitably everyone who sees me and doesn’t know me thinks I am a woman and my high-pitched voice doesn’t help. Gay men reject me out of hand just as everyone else does but they especially.  Most people reject anyone who rubs their hands talks to themselves isn’t making eye contact and doesn’t seem to be fully in the world.  But there’s a stigma around effeminate gay men that makes no sense to me.  We owe everything we’ve gained to the Stonewall rebellion and that was the drag queens who led that!  When I was a child while I was brought up in a rabidly fundamentalist faith my private opinion was that gay men and lesbians should simply have the surgery.  Then they could simply repent once (instead of endlessly) and move on with their lives.  I was nine when I thought of that; I know better now.    These drugs that block puberty would never have been available to me or even permitted.  Mother and her fundamentalism would never stand for my taking them.  She needed to have two growing boys to hate and destroy with endless verbal and emotional abuse.  We all knew in in my family that I’m a trans who hasn’t begun but it was an elephant in our room.    My brother and I are both total wrecks and social cripples.  We were never allowed to form real friendships or date.  And then when we finally become adults here in Idaho we don’t fit in at all.  None of the things that either of us know about are of any help in developing friendships or dating.  Even finally ceasing fighting my gayness and deciding instead to try to live celibate (until I came to Wicca and after a time chose Wicca) didn’t solve the problem.  Under Hecate’s rule I could finally accept myself.  But that didn’t mean anyone else did.  Just because I quit fighting my gayness didn’t mean anyone else would accept it.  My family certainly didn’t.  They thought it went away because of some deliverance ministry.  Don’t ask.   It wasn’t until I was twenty-five that I even met my only lover in my entire life.  We lasted almost a year as a sexless couple because that’s what he ultimately wanted due to his own issues and I put up with it because I loved him.  Much as I put up with him betraying me only for him to turn around and put me out.  I went through hell with my family for his sake and at the first test from his he casts me away.  I don’t think I’ve ever fully recovered.   Since then no one has really wanted me.  Several men have played me saying they want me but expecting me to do things I’m unwilling to do because they’re usually about money.  I won’t co-mingle funds.  I just won’t.   Because of the kind of state Idaho is where wages are low and getting fired is easy every time I tried to establish a life for myself it failed and I wound up getting thrown back to Mother’s couch.  No friends no support system nothing at all.  And while that meant I had a roof it also meant I had no privacy no rights no expectation of anything positive and certainly no progress on either the romantic or sexual fronts.  Really it was simple math.  I could be housed provided I was her defacto slave and always subjected myself to the endless screaming and attempts to reindoctrinate me back into Christianity or else.  And “Or else” came in the form of my first stint of homelessness.   Homeless in Portland.  Being there made me feel worse because there were so many gay & trans-affirming places.  If I’d wanted to transition there I should’ve been able to but I couldn’t because I had no home and no way of getting one.  I have a lifelong weakness.  For some reason no matter how many applications I filled out I never got job interviews.  Trashy clothes nice clothes wild hair washed hair manicured hair driven around by Voc Rehab counselors . . . didn’t matter.  Without Voc Rehab encouraging them employers wouldn’t touch me.  They never did say why.  I’m not a thief I’ve never been arrested for anything but I’m just that weird.   Imagine having the worst of both worlds.  Places to be that might accept your sexuality whatever it was surrounding you.  But you still don’t dare set foot in there because homelessness is still a big problem for you.  Your possessions at your side because it isn’t safe to stash them you are still disqualified from seeking out relief or pleasure.  And again you just keep getting reminded that nothing ventured nothing lost.  Or in other words risk isn’t worth it.  It’s only going to end in defeat right from the start so you might as well just turn away and go back to daily survival.   I’ve only had my disability benefits for about three years and I’m scared they’ll be turned off because they’ll think I’ve “Recovered” enough to work again.  But being basically unemployable?  I fear I won’t survive if I’m forced into the streets a third time.   For forty years I’ve wanted to transition and I still do.  That hasn’t changed.  I want to be a woman always have always will.  But I don’t believe I’m ever going to be in a position where I can let my guard down to do it.  Could you imagine me trying to go have the surgery while still living with Mother?  Can you guess what she’d scream and do?  No doubt leave me homeless again.  Transitioning while in Portland on the streets?  Impossible.  Now?  When I know no one but grocery store employees and fear the loss of my benefits at any time?   God I’m so sick of this stress!  I’ve spent 42 years waiting to see when it’s my turn to have any say over my life.  And I still haven’t gotten my turn.   Then of course there’s my brother.  He ridiculed me and gave away my confidences in him.  I’d tell him something and he’d run off to Mother with it.  By now you should all know what that means . . .  A couple of years ago he came to me and told me that he wanted to transition and had already started wearing womens’ clothing in secret.  She needed my support so of course I granted it.  But asked only for a visit to the restroom alone.  There I cried not with relief but out of anger and frustration.  You see my sibling has a terrible tendency to take whatever I was trying to learn and master it in minutes.  It didn’t matter what it was anything I can do he can do better.  He can do anything better than me.  Yes he can.  Yes he can.  Yes he can. . . .   I have to be one of her close confidantes give her advice and support and listen to her fears about this.  All the while never telling her what I really think.  And it means that I was forced to question both she and I.  This revelation left me wondering if Mother caused this and if this was really an abnormal or improper thing for both of us.  For me wanting to be a woman was always natural something that’s been part of me all my life.  Her sharing this trait destroyed my confidence yet I was expected to fully back her.  I thought this meant that I had to surrender that to her too.  Sacrifice yet another important aspect of myself and just stay a gay man albeit one with absolutely no masculinity at all except a beard.  Even my uh ability to make sperm doesn’t work anymore; a combination of diabetes and blood pressure pills.  Oddly I don’t actually care.  I’m not concerned about it.  There’s a fluid leak in my testicles that needs a surgery to correct and I only care about it because it causes my urine to deflect unless I sit down.  It’s not important to me otherwise.  Because I don’t even want that body part.  It took me some time to sort it out.  But the fact is I want to transition.  Still and after all this time.  But I’ve never been in a position not even now when it was possible or safe.  It’s one reason I want to move and start my life over.
