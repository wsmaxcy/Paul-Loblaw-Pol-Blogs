L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 6/30/21: Halftime, jckforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-06-30, We’re halfway through 2021. Time for a wellness check. How’s everybody doing. Are you vaccinated yet? Is something preventing you from getting your shot? How are we all doing otherwise? If you are vaxxed congrats! We may be good to go for awhile. A new study on the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines shows they not only protect people from COVID-19 but perhaps for longer than first thought. According to the study by Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis these two mRNA vaccines could provide protection for years - not just months as first thought. The study published in the journal Nature shows the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies and B cells that support the immune system. Which is a relief because the virus is upping its game. The more dangerous and more transmissible Delta variant has spread to almost every state in the US fueling health experts' concerns about Covid-19 spikes. The variant is expected to become the dominant coronavirus strain in the US the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. And with half the US still not fully vaccinated doctors say it could cause a resurgence of Covid-19 in the fall -- just as children too young to get vaccinated go back to school. Unfortunately rank stupidity is not far behind. Nearly 100 COVID-19 cases have resulted from an outbreak at a summer youth camp in west central Illinois mostly involving unvaccinated people the Illinois Department of Public Health reported Monday. So far 85 campers and adult staff members with Crossing Camp in Rushville have contracted the virus. Eleven additional COVID-19 cases occurred when a couple of camp participants attended a conference nearby in mid-June. So far out here in sunny Sonoma County we haven’t had to evacuate yet but it’s still early in the season. It is however shaping up into one hell of a season. Portland Ore. was forecast to hit record 114 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday shattering Sunday's all-time temperature record of 112 degrees which surpassed Saturday's record of 107 degrees. Seattle also set a record on Sunday reaching 104 degrees in a city where many people don't have air conditioning while the town of Lytton British Columbia reached 116 degrees. Described as a “once in a millennium” weather event the heat dome that has gripped the Pacific Northwest is notable because such extreme temperatures are a rarity in the region. But thanks to climate change they may not be so unusual in the years to come. “Climate change is clearly increasing the severity and frequency of unprecedented extreme heat events globally” Daniel Swain climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles told Yahoo News. “That’s also specifically true in individual regions.” While the causes of the heat dome weather phenomenon are complex — a ridge of high pressure descended on the Pacific Northwest offshore winds drew in unusually dry air to the region from the high desert etc. — the climate conditions that precipitated it have been trending steadily in one direction. “The mean warming in this region so far has been somewhere between 2 and 4 degrees Fahrenheit so I think it’s fair to say that at a minimum climate change contributed at least that much to the severity of this heat wave" Swain said. Whoops spoke too soon. The Lava Fire — burning between the city of Weed and Mt. Shasta — jumped from 1446 acres on Monday to 13300 acres as of 10 a.m. Tuesday. It's 20% contained according to the U.S. Forest Service. More than 800 personnel are fighting the fire. Tuesday firefighters planned to scout for containment opportunities north of the fire and hold constructed lines to the south and west cutting off the fire before it reaches residential areas the Forest Service said. Steep rocky terrain limited road access to the fire and limited water sources close to the fire are impeding firefighting efforts in the area. We haven’t gotten our wish of seeing the Loser and his spawn frog-marched into Leavenworth but maybe someday? Donald Trump is facing a potentially crippling financial and political blow as state prosecutors consider filing criminal charges against his family business this week. Prosecutors in New York could soon bring an indictment against the Trump Organization related to the taxation of lucrative perks that it gave to top executives such as use of apartments cars and school tuition. The 45th president is not expected to be personally charged but the legal drama could bankrupt his company by damaging its relationships with banks and other business partners as well as clouding his political comeback. Ron Fischetti a lawyer for the Trump Organization held a virtual meeting with prosecutors last Thursday for about 90 minutes in an effort to dissuade them from pursuing criminal charges against the company. We’re not getting our noses rubbed in government corruption as blatantly anymore the rich still get richer. With today’s surge in Facebook shares all five of the tech megacaps have now eclipsed the $1 trillion valuation level. Facebook ‘s rally came after a federal court judge granted the company’s motions to dismiss dual antitrust cases filed by the Federal Trade Commission and a group of 48 state attorneys general. This is the first time that the U.S. market has had five stocks with a 13-digit valuation. Apple (ticker: AAPL) is still the world’s most valued company at $2.249 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.024 trillion. Amazon (AMZN) is valued at $1.74 trillion Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is at $1.67 trillion and Facebook (FB) is now worth $1.008 trillion. Microsoft crossed the $2 trillion level for the first time last week. (Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (2222.SR) not traded in the U.S. has a valuation of $1.87 trillion.) We’ve made some progress but there’s still a lot of work to do. Kitchen Table Kibitzing is a community series for those who wish to share a virtual kitchen table with other readers of Daily Kos who aren’t throwing pies at one another. Drop by to talk about music your weather your garden or what you cooked for supper…. Newcomers may notice that many who post in this series already know one another to some degree but we welcome guests at our kitchen table and hope to make some new friends as well.
