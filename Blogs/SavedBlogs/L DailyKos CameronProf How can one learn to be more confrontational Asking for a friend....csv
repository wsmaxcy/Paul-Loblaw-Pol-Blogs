L, How can one learn to be more "confrontational"? Asking for a friend..., CameronProf, 2021-07-07, I am about one of the biggest introverts that exist in my circle of existence.  Ever since I was teh child I avoided any form of confrontation yelling etc. by curling into a ball putting my fingers in my ears and hoping it would go away.  When people are unkind to others often times I get physical manifestations of it as if I was the one on the receiving end. When people be they doctors roommates nurses people in general confront me I shy away even when often they are not being confrontational to me because of something that I have done but it is how they interact with everyone.   They seem to naturally come at you in a brisk confrontational manner as that is how they act towards everyone (For example my 1 brother no one has any contact with the cna I had mentioned in the past where I live etc.) I just basically cower down and let them rant and do not say anything meanwhile as a result I pay the price with my innards and become even more of who I was coming deeper into the circle.  When I mention this topic before whether to family friends etc. basically the response is: “Be assertive just stand up for yourself you have done nothing wrong”  The problem is I am in such a deep feeling of discomfort I do not *know* how to do that and I am fearful of even trying to do so.  I wonder if others here have the same issue that I do and how they approach it.
