L, Kitchen Table Kibitzing 4/27/2021: To Your Health!, belinda ridgewoodforKitchen Table Kibitzing, 2021-04-27,  Good evening Kibitzers!  In theory between the time I write this and the time you read it I will have gotten my second Moderna shot. I am prepared to feel like crap after it but not instantly I hope. My plan is to do as I did last time which was go home in such a way as to pass the nice Italian supermarket and stop there to pick up some comforting prepared foods for a couple of days’ lunches and suppers (plus a small treat from the pastry counter for being a good girl). Last time I went they had fabulous arancini the size of softballs one of which makes a great lunch so I am hoping to see those again.  [Update: Got the shot got the arancini feeling okay so far but it’s early yet.] The other part of my plan is to make myself a drink when I get home. I know we’re not out of the woods by any means but as many here have observed before it really feels like a big fucking deal to have even the first shot so I am expecting to wish to celebrate the second. I came nowhere near exhausting YouTube’s supply of videos that satisfy our curiosity about how various adult beverages come to be. This is just sort of a survey course but it seemed appropriate for the day. I raise a glass to relief and to the hope everyone can soon be protected. Let’s start with beer as many of us do. This video takes a more scientific approach than most of those I have here.   [6:45] I was trying to stay away from the ones where grandpa shows you how to make wine at home…   [8:50] As I never tire of saying I thought I didn’t like Champagne until I got on the train to Paris. They were coming around with trays of it of course and I thought well I’m on a train to Paris what the hell. I immediately learned that what I didn’t like is whatever they pour in wedding-reception halls in New Jersey. Champagne is fucking awesome.    [4:24] Before we start distilling let’s look at hardware. Or not so hard in the case of corks.   [4:06] Barrels kind of bridge the gap between wine and whiskey.   [15:37] My favorite line here is “Production continues there with the approval of Congress.” Yeah no doubt.   [5:06] This narration is certainly synthetic speech imo with text written by someone who is not a native English speaker. Its accent is an interesting choice but without better inflection it’s not fooling anyone. Obviously this has nothing to do with the information about vodka.   [8:18] Alton Brown explains why gin and tonic is medicine.   [4:57] I personally had no idea about this tequila process. Wow.   [5:04] I love Lagavulin. It smells like dirt in a good way. On Islay they’d call it “peaty” but they mean it smells like dirt.   [10:33 minus the 1:04 of Johnnie Walker ads I peeled off the front.] To finish up here Bon Appétit rounds up ten chefs to show how to make their favorite drinks.   [18:19] Actually music to finish up. Paste your drinking-themed tunes in the comments please — I certainly can’t stuff them all in this diary! Also your other comments drink recipes and in fact random utterances are also welcome because that’s how we roll here.   [4:42] At the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute Wembley Stadium 1988.   [5:34] At the 1993 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductions then-surviving members of The Doors play with Eddie Vedder.   [5:41] My sincere apologies to those who cannot consume alcohol for boring you with all this. I’d urge you to get back at me by booking a KTK diary and writing about say halvah or tahini two preparations that just taste like fire to me and not in a good way.   [2:19] Today’s Political and Other Short Subjects: The Meidas Touch would like to remind Dan Crenshaw (R-TX-02) about an earlier comment he’s conveniently forgotten.   [0:45] The Parody Project has a song about that pillow guy to the tune of Tit-Willow from Gilbert & Sullivan’s The Mikado.   [3:30] Founders Sing on the other hand is going with Albert Einstein singing a Temptations tune because why not?   [3:11] I had something else in this spot and then Jon Batiste (with Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails) won the Oscar for Best Original Score for the Pixar film Soul which also won Best Animated Feature. For my money the CBS This Morning interviewers could shut up just a little more but Jon does get to talk and it’s lovely to hear what he says.  [5:00] It’s not that an 18-second video of someone petting a duck is that remarkable. It’s just that I really like the title it’s been given: Epic Duck Just Vibing.    [0:18] This is a “Yay New Jersey” piece from a few weeks ago wherein frogs and salamanders are assisted across the road to vernal pools. Note that we are speaking of amphibians here — some are long but everything here has legs.  [3:21] Stay safe!  💙💙💙💙💙  The Democracy Docket website founded by formidable our-side attorney Marc Elias carries breaking news about current election law more in-depth articles and always information plus all available legal documents (as PDFs) about every active election law case.

I can’t even link all the places they’re working. They’re feeding people who need meals wherever they find them for whatever reason and by whatever means including supporting local restaurants by contracting with them for meals. Pretty much every tab at that website will tell you something amazing. You can always donate or volunteer at their website but it may not be up on the very latest news. For that check Twitter for Chef Andrés and for World Central Kitchen.  Please see Denise Oliver Velez’s diary for information on and ways to help the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and the nearby islands where people are currently threatened by a dangerous volcanic eruption.  It has been 1315 DAYS SINCE HURRICANE MARIA MADE LANDFALL IN PUERTO RICO ON SEPTEMBER 20 2017.  As federal money begins to flow so many problems have built up due to various natural disasters drought Covid as a pandemic and with its economic impacts it’s not the case that a big pile of cash is just going to fix everything there. At the root of the problem is racism; what a surprise. It’s easy for wealthy colonizers to loot a place when there aren’t many people who care what happens there. It’s… kind of a pattern. Since no one can snap their fingers and declare the problem solved this box is now tracking reports from Denise Oliver-Velez. To learn more about what’s going on there her Twitter feed and Daily Kos comments are good starting points. 1313 days after Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico has become a cheap tourist location in the midst of the pandemic. The price isn't cheap for islanders; it's deadly.   Missing some past entry? My past diaries list where the older purple boxes still live. NEW: In the latest SciShow video host Rose Bear Don't Walk* (Salish/Crow; Yale ‘16) discusses how mRNA vaccines actually work and why they’re not able to change our DNA as some fear . See also their playlist of Covid updates on what we’re learning. *This is a complete digression from Covid but Hank Green’s been hosting the Covid news segments himself so I was interested when this young woman showed up instead and the more so when I read her name. It turns out the Bear Don’t Walk family is a distinguished one and she is bent on making a difference for her Salish community. The thing I turned up about her that I liked best was her jingle dress dance for hope. NEW: @AhsanteB’s interview with Dr. Bisola Ojikutu of the Harvard School of Public Health answers a lot of questions that the vaccine-hesitant or curious might be thinking. It’s a good presentation obviously aimed at the Black community but informative to anyone. Anyway! Variants: 🦠 Dr. Fauci talks with Seth Meyers about the new virus variants and how much danger they pose. 🦠 A video from the Wall Street Journal (whose news division remember is good) goes into more and geekier detail about how the variants work. 🦠 A Vox video reviews how smallpox was eradicated and discusses the roadblocks to fighting Covid in the same ways. NEW: This video is not specific to Covid but offers a fairly simple account of how our immune system works. NEW articles: The Atlantic has listed their ongoing virus coverage here and none is behind a paywall. They add new articles often including these two: The Rural Pandemic Isn’t Ending and The Blood-Clot Problem Is Multiplying. xaxnar’s diary (with its comment thread) discusses neurological impacts seen in “long-haul” Covid sufferers. wilderness voice’s KosAbility diary (and comment thread) offer further discussion of long Covid its symptoms and their relationship to ME/CFS. This tweet by Joseph Allen links to a NY Times visual presentation about how we can change the airflow in classrooms to make it safer. There’s also a link from there to an Instagram “augmented reality” classroom visit. The Washington Post is maintaining this page that tracks vaccine arrival and distribution state by state. Note this is NOT paywalled. This virus spread tracking site also has an excellent “wiki” page on virus information/misinformation proper mask use symptoms etc.  h/t eeff! This excellent video explains clearly how viruses are killed by washing with soap.   h/t Sara R! A doctor shows how to quickly alter a disposable mask to get a safer fit. CDC chart shows how to remove gloves properly to avoid contamination. The lung exercises in this diary are still good for anyone sick or not. [Sara R and winglion have suspended taking orders for masks while Sara is recovering from her surgery. If you hear they’re able to take orders again before I do you can find their links in my past diaries.] PALM BEACH (The Borowitz Report)—Unsparing in his criticism of the President Donald J. Trump blasted Joe Biden for firing almost no one in his first hundred days.    [snip] In another alleged failure of Biden’s first hundred days Trump ripped the President for having picked “no fights whatsoever” with TV celebrities. “It’s almost like he doesn’t even watch TV” Trump said. “What does he do all day?” — The Borowitz Report at The New Yorker This Week in Boredom:
