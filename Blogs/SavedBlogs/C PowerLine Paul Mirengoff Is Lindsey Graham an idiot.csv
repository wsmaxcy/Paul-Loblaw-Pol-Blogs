C, Is Lindsey Graham an idiot?, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-07-03, Philip Klein of National Review thinks so. In fact his  latest column is called “Lindsey Graham is an idiot.” Klein bases his assessment on the fact that Graham is now back on board the bipartisan infrastructure deal. Graham had jumped off when Joe Biden said he would only sign the bipartisan bill in tandem with a multi-trillion dollar Democrats-only reconciliation bill containing the rest of his liberal wish list. At that point Graham  declared that Biden had made him look like “a f—— idiot.” Because it’s still clear that Biden Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi view the bipartisan bill and the Dems’ reconciliation bill as a package it’s understandable that Klein calls Graham an idiot. Is he one though? I’ve made many derogatory comments about Graham over the years but I’ve never considered him unintelligent. I still don’t. It’s difficult for anyone on the outside to know just how the infrastructure-plus saga will play out in a bipartisan scenario and how it would play out without Republican buy-in. My sense is that the legislative result will be basically the same whether it’s the product of two bills — a bipartisan deal plus reconciliation — or just one reconciliation bill. In either case it will come down to what Joe Manchin wants. Similarly my guess is that the political fallout will be more or less the same in either scenario. It’s conceivable that Manchin will force Democrats to take a somewhat smaller total package to reward Republicans for their bipartisanship. On the other hand it’s conceivable that to keep the price tag of a reconciliation bill down he would take a somewhat smaller total package if Republicans forced him to do the whole thing through reconciliation.  At the most though we’re talking about marginal differences I suspect. My preference nonetheless is for making the Democrats go it alone. But that’s mainly because of my distaste on aesthetic grounds for bipartisanship.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
