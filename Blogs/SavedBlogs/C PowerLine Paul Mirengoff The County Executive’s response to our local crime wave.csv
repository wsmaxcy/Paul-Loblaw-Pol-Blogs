C, The County Executive’s response to our local crime wave, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-04, Yesterday I  discussed the crime wave in Montgomery County Maryland. Homicides carjackings and armed robberies are all up this year.  In January there were seven homicides. According to the chief of police that’s an all-time record for a single month. As for armed robberies they have increased by 40 percent. How will the County respond? Its task force on “Reimagining Public Safety” is  recommending fewer police on streets and the elimination of funding for officers in schools. In addition it recommends “alternative responses to crime” shifting certain law enforcement responsibilities from police to county agencies and community organizations and inevitably collecting and analyzing data to address both racial and social disparities. Clearly this is no way to combat a crime wave. It’s a sure-fire way to exacerbate one.  Will the County implement these recommendations? Our far left County Executive Marc Elrich seems eager to do so — and soon. He greeted the recommendations in which he likely had a hand with this: 
I think social justice has been a long time coming. And telling people that it could be a long time before we deal with this would just be kind of insult to injury. We have to address this and this has got to be a priority.
 Unfortunately “this” doesn’t mean crime. It means the alleged absence of “social justice.” Elrich has been trying to sabotage the police since he took office. He  wanted to hire an incompetent police chief who had been fired from her previous job as police chief in a smaller jurisdiction. Her calling cards were her race and her lack of any association with policing in Montgomery County. Hiring her was too much even for our liberal County Council.  Under Elrich the police department is experiencing  defections on a large scale. He must see this as a good thing — all the easier to reduce the number of officers protecting the public and to hand over police functions to “community organizations.”  The statistics show that Montgomery County is already “reimagining public safety” and developing “alternative responses” to crime. The reimagined alternative response is to grin and bear it — in the name of “equity.” My liberal neighbors seem disinclined to reimagine their safety in this fashion. They express growing concern and anger about the crime spike. Whether these liberals can reimagine their politics to the point of replacing Elrich with a more conventional liberal (a conservative is out of the question) remains to be seen. The best alternative might be to reimagine the side of the Potomac River on which to reside. To be sure the rot is spreading to Northern Virginia too but probably not as quickly as here.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
