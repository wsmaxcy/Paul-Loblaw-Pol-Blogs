C, And now an important message from "Dr. Fauci" about wearing masks at home , Allahpundit, 2021-05-06, To cleanse the palate I enjoyed this enough that I felt obliged to share. My guess is that Fauci-haters of which there are many will enjoy it even more. Watch then read on. Important Dr. Fauci update: pic.twitter.com/xTePKmeOBk — Tyler Fischer (@TyTheFisch) May 3 2021  It’s hard to believe after the past year that soon Fauci jokes will feel passe a remnant of an era we’ve left behind and which no one will ever want to revisit. But we are leaving that era behind. If the declining daily case counts don’t convince you maybe the rising daily condom sales will: Male condom sales in the United States increased 23.4% to $37 million during the four weeks ending April 18 compared with the same stretch a year ago according to the latest figures from IRI a market research firm that tracks point-of-sale data at big box retailers grocery stores drug stores and other retail channels… Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) also said condom sales have grown at stores in recent weeks compared with a year ago. A spokesperson for CVS called the growth “substantial” in an email but did not provide data… Even before the pandemic condom sales had been sluggish. Sales dropped 2.4% in 2017 and 3.4% in 2018 before ticking up 1.2% in 2019 according to IRI data. Considering most of the country was locked down last March and April a 23 percent surge in condom purchases this year over the same stretch seems like no great shakes. Aren’t sales of pretty much everything up this spring? Except toilet paper of course. To give this dumb post some redeeming value read this report on Fauci’s comments yesterday comparing the different levels of protection people get from different forms of immunity. In some cases those who’ve been vaccinated have up to 10 times the number of antibodies that people who’ve recovered from a COVID infection have he said. But people who’ve had COVID and then get a single vaccine dose seem to be powerfully protected from the virus including three of its most dangerous variants and even different coronaviruses like SARS. If you’ve been infected and are wondering if a shot will do anything extra for you the answer seems to be a resounding yes.
