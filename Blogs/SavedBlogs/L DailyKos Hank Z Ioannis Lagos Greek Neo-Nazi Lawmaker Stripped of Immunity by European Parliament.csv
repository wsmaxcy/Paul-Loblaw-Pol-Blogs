L, Ioannis Lagos Greek Neo-Nazi Lawmaker Stripped of Immunity by European Parliament, Hank Z, 2021-04-27,  Belgian authorities on Tuesday took a Greek far-right member of the European Parliament into custody ahead of his likely extradition to Greece to serve a 13-year prison sentence for being a leading member of a criminal organization. The move came after the EU assembly voted 658-24 with 10 abstentions to remove the parliamentary protection of the deputy Ioannis Lagos paving the way for him to be sent back on a European arrest warrant. … “A European arrest warrant has been issued at our request and that warrant has been executed by the Belgian authorities. The matter is now in the hands of the judiciary” Greek Police spokesman Theodoros Chronopoulos told The Associated Press.   A French Greens lawmaker Marie Toussaint who chaperoned the vote through the EU parliament said that “it was essential for the European Union to lift the immunity of Ioannis Lagos so that he can face justice in his country.” “Impunity cannot be tolerated” Toussaint said in a statement and she warned more broadly about the dangers of hate speech in Europe and the violence it provokes.
