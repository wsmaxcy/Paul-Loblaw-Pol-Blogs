Cawthorn's Instagram account features a post which is location stamped at the Eagle's Nest from 2017. The mountaintop building designed as a 50th birthday present for the Nazi leader is open to the public as a historic site. Like the video of Cruz Mitchell's clip starts with the Congressman apparently posing for a selfie. Mitchell asks: "How was visiting Hitler's house?" Hawthorn responds: "No didn't go there."
