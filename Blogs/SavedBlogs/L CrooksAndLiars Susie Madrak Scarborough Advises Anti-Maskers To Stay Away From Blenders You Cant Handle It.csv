L, Scarborough Advises Anti-Maskers To Stay Away From Blenders: 'You Can't Handle It', Susie Madrak, 03-30-21, Joe Scarborough is really pissed off at the stubborn contingent of Trump-believing anti-maskers in the Republican party. "Republicans are not just fighting distancing. Trump supporters people who are still in that personality cult aren't just saying masks are no good. In fact they spread disease!" he said incredulous. "Come on stay away from household appliances. Stay away from the blender. you're not meant for it. But it's now vaccines. They've now moved on to vaccines. And you have Donald Trump -- it's all because of me but you don't have to take the vaccine. But half of Americans half of people who supported Donald Trump don't want to take the vaccine. He's come out a couple of times and say yeah you should take the vaccine I got one. "He's not showing any leadership. But why would he show leadership? He's never shown leadership. And instead you have these anti-science people who are not only bashing the vaccine but are also saying no you know what we need to make sure that nobody in America knows who took the vaccine and who didn't take -- wrong! wrong! Hey you know what? You know what? You missed the stop. The train left the station" he taunted. "Your idiocy that you and the last president together helped kill hundreds of thousands of Americans that stop was like -- it left on January the 20th. and you're just standing there by yourself. And look around at the idiots who were around you. who were saying no social distancing. who were saying no masking who were attacking the vaccine. you guys want to stand there on that platform and get sick and kill each other that's up to you. but we've moved on. "Stay out of leaders' way who want to make sure that we can once again go back to our life. We can once again take our kids to baseball games. We once again can go to concerts. We once again can get moving on with our lives by showing that we were not stupid enough to say no to a vaccine." For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
