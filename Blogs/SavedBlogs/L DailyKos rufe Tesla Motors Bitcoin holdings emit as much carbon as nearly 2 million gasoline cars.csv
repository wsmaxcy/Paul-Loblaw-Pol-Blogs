L, Tesla Motors' Bitcoin holdings emit as much carbon as nearly 2 million gasoline cars, rufe, 2021-05-04, Tesla Motors a manufacturer of luxury electric vehicles came under fire by some environmentalists earlier this year for a large investment in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.  Due to its digital nature Bitcoin requires the consumption of energy to be produced and used but the exact impact had previously been only the subject of small academic studies.  Bank of America has tried to quantify the carbon emissions of an average Bitcoin transaction.  They found that half of Bitcoin mining is in a single region of China where over 80% of electricity is generated by coal while 75% of Bitcoin's network is in regions of China with predominantly coal power. Furthermore they found that due to the diminishing returns of Bitcoin mining and sensitivity of miners to cost large Bitcoin purchases and increases in the value of Bitcoin increase the average emissions of Bitcoin as more computing power is required for each subsequent Bitcoin mined and less efficient mining rigs become profitable.  Based on their estimates Tesla Motors' purchase of $1.5 billion dollars of Bitcoin emited the equivalent of 1.8 million gasoline cars. Tesla's plan to accept Bitcoin as payment for vehicles in the future would emit as much as 30 to over 100 gasoline cars per vehicle if implemented.  The report highlights the importance of government regulation of cryptocurrency carbon emissions as they grow in popularity as a form of speculative investment.
