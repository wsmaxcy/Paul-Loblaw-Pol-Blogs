L, At ID Rally DJT Calls Biden "Most Unpatriotic President in History" Racist Dog Whistling in Dixie, Mark Karlin, 2021-07-04, Despite the pleas of his mini-me Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) Trump held a “Save America” rally that drew a large crowd in Sarasota on Friday Night.  DeSantis did not want a political rally to compete with the attention and rescue efforts focused on the Surfside Champlain South condo building with more than 100 persons still missing (as well as the favorable media attention De Santis was receiving for “managing a crisis”) As it rained on his cultists Trump declared Joe Biden as “perhaps the most unpatriotic president in history.” The former president whose company and CFO are now under indictment also falsely declared that he had saved Mount Rushmore from being altered to replace the four presidential heads with among others Rev. Al Sharpton. He also excoriated Biden’s reversal of his executive order to teach a colonial settler version of US history in American schools and deplored the “1619 Project.” This is all consistent with Trump’s two campaigns and one-term presidency championing only one principle: this is a patriarchal white nation and Blacks and Browns are little more than ghosts of the enslaved. As Yahoo News reported: "The mission for all of us here tonight is to preserve the legacy of July 4 1776 and to defend our liberty from the radical Left movement that seeks to cancel this date demolish our heritage and destroy our beloved nation" [Trump] said. The heritage of which he speaks is a false narrative embedded in US history that the white man saved North America from savages and improved the souls of Blacks by enslaving them. In short he is making America’s twin original sins into virtues that his white grievance followers find emotionally liberating. In his landmark book “The Tribalization of Politics” Ian Reifowitz writes how Rush Limbaugh prepared the pathway for Trump’s ascent through “racial-priming. “You know how this story ended [of Trump’s 2016 run for the presidency]— the party base was so smitten by that overt racism replacing dog whistles with dog whips that it ignored Trump’s weak conservative bona fides and outright flaws.” Indeed as an ignited emotional appeal to the potential loss of white patriarchal rule nothing has precedence with the “white victimhood” and white nationalist movement more than a flawed savior of white man rule and decreasing government support for non-whites. That is why The Guardian account of Trump’s Independence Day Rally (actually held the night of July 3) notes the indifference of Trump followers to his recent indictment and ongoing revelations of wrongdoing including an attempted coup: Two days earlier the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg had pleaded not guilty to tax fraud charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney (DA). The case in New York could be merely the tip of a legal iceberg that threatens Trump himself. But Joe Walsh a former Republican congressman turned Trump critic tweeted in response: “Trump’s supporters already know he’s a tax cheat a liar a ruler-breaker and a crook. They don’t care.” Interviews at the rally with some of the ex-president’s most ardent fans put this hypothesis to the test. Some did indeed shrug and move on. Others echoed  Trump’s view that the charges were politically motivated. More than one prefaced their answer with the words “it’s bullshit.” In the end most whites with their backs against the wall as the demographics of America inextricably move them into minority status still see Trump as the iconic savior from a United States unmoored from its white “manifest destiny.” Only in an alternative universe and Trump groupies occupy that fantasy world borne of white supremacy would a president such as Biden be considered unpatriotic and a thoroughly corrupt con artist who has no sense of US history beyond that it has been White-ruled be considered a “patriot” when he is actually guilty of treason and rampant corruption and violations of the law.
