L, Kamala Harris Visits Historic Woolworth's Lunch Counter Where Sit-In Movement Began, Ryan Grenoble, 2021-04-19, In a surprise stop during a visit to Greensboro North Carolina on Monday Vice President Kamala Harris dropped in on the International Civil Rights Center and Museum. The museum houses what remains of the Woolworth’s five-and-dime where on Feb. 1 1960 four Black college students sat at a lunch counter and politely asked for service ― a revolutionary act at the time. They were rebuffed but they returned to the whites-only lunch counter day after day in increasing numbers popularizing the sit-in movement that spread quickly across the South. Harris reportedly sat in the seat once occupied by Rosa Parks when she visited the museum in the 1990s.
