L, Supreme Court Evisceration of Voting Rights Act Leaves Referendums Only Way to Save Arizona Voters, EricAZ, 2021-07-01, The Supreme Court eliminated most of the remaining protections of the federal Voting Rights Act on Thursday leaving referendum petitions as the only way to protect Arizona voters from the sweeping dictatorial and absurd enactments of the Arizona Legislature. The only other hope for protecting voters a new federal voter protection law is blocked in the U.S. Senate by the filibuster. In a straight 6-3 partisan vote the Supreme Court upheld laws that prevented Native Americans living in remote villages from working together to get their ballots turned in at the county seat which can be more than 100 miles away. The court also decided to arbitrarily throw away ballots that arrived at the wrong precinct despite very challenging geography that makes accurately determining voter precincts all but impossible. In upholding two Arizona voter suppression laws from 2016 the court majority all but eliminated the federal statute which has been the bedrock of voter protection since the 1960s. Anticipating the court decision the Arizona Legislature has enacted a raft of new voter suppression bills that have been dubbed: The BAD The WORSE The BETRAYAL And The ABSOLUTELY CRAZY The BAD bill eliminates the popular Permanent Early Voting List used by more than 80% of Arizonans to vote by mail and replaces it with another list that is purged by officials depending on people’s voting patterns. The WORSE bill defunds elections by cutting off grant funding that election officials have used to put drop boxes in remote areas and otherwise support the accurate and timely counting of votes. The BETRAYAL breaks a settlement with the Navajo Nation in a federal voting rights lawsuit that allows people in remote villages five business days to travel to the county seat to supply a missing signature to a mail-in ballot. The ABSOLUTELY CRAZY is a laundry list of nutty ideas that has come out of the “Cyber Ninja” “Audit” of Arizona’s votes. Provisions range from denying the current Secretary of State access to the courts (access is restored to her successor by the bill) turning voter registration over to the state department of Game and Fish to secretly encoding ballots with various types of hidden inks and markings. It is unknown whether these will allow government officials to determine how people voted. Other provisions give $500000 in government funds to investigate in support of a state legislator who has been banned from social media for running a Russian-style troll farm.  Arizona Deserves Better can stop these laws from going into effect by collecting 118000 signatures for each bill in the next 90 days.
