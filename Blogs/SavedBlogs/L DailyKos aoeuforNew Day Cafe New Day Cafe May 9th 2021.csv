L, New Day Cafe: May 9th 2021, aoeuforNew Day Cafe, 2021-05-09, Three more weeks of winter officially. I got the Moderna jab three weeks ago and I had the Covid last year so I’m probably already safe. Come on in. New Day Cafe is one of our DailyKos openthreads posting at 07:30 Portland Standard Time. If you have a question or something to say don’t be bashful. Sign up here. Our Rules of the Road are here. I went to the Saturday Market downtown yesterday for the first time this year. I didn’t go at all last year. The drum circle wasn’t very big.  This is my current project as it looked when I bought it. I’m pretty sure it was a twelve speed when it was new and had twenty seven inch wheels and tires. I don’t have any of those so it got 700Cs. Gearing is a whole set of problems. That’s a link to Sheldon Brown’s website. It skips in fourth gear. One of the choices is newer wheels and widening the rear triangle to 130mm. I hope to know more next week. I may have to get another front derailleur. It had cantilever brakes which require old style levers that I don’t have any of so I put on a set of V-brakes that were on a wider frame. They’re a close fit. Check out the reflectors. The first album in a list of 20. Some are blocked in the US.    Time for pie breakfast.  What’s on your mind this morning? We were all new here once don’t be bashful.
