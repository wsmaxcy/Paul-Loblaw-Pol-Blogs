L, June 30 Good News Roundup, niftywriterforGood News, 2021-06-30, Good Day Gnusies. It’s been an eventful week so far with more to come.  Let’s get straight to the good news.  Opinion: A small ‘Trump proofing’ reform is set to advance. It could make a real difference. Greg Sargent Washington Post June 29 2021. Sometime on Tuesday evening the House of Representatives is expected to pass a bill that would strengthen the independence and oversight powers of inspectors general in a host of new ways. ✂️ The bill — which is called the IG Independence and Empowerment Act and is being championed by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) — would codify into law a host of new safeguards for inspectors general. Those are the internal watchdogs at government agencies who are supposed to be independent from pressure from presidents or their political appointees. The measure responds to abuses that we saw undertaken with great relish by Trump. For instance it codifies a requirement that a president can only remove an IG if specific and defined types of malfeasance or lawbreaking have been documented. The bill also places new limitations on a president’s ability to leave an IG position blank an obvious way a president might limit oversight on himself. And Tweeps.. if you missed it. Speaker Pelosi's Jan 6 commission has some details out. She will seat 8 Democrats and 5 Republicans. She will PERSONALLY decide if Qevin McCarthy's nominations will be accepted so she has VETO power over the nuttersThis is MAGNIFICENT news House votes to remove Confederate statues and replace Roger B. Taney bust Alex Rogers CNN June 29 2021 The House passed a resolution Tuesday to expel Confederate statues from the US Capitol and replace its bust of Roger B. Taney the chief justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision with one honoring Thurgood Marshall the first African American Supreme Court justice. The vote was 285 to 120. Sixty-seven Republicans voted with 218 Democrats in support of the bill.The House passed a similar resolution last year on a bipartisan basis but it stalled after Republicans in the Senate argued that the states should decide which statues they'd like to display in the Capitol. The legislation has a better chance to pass now that Democrats hold the Senate majority.

Prescription drug prices are ridiculously high in the USA and some years ago it was Walmart that began to offer commonly prescribed medicines for $4. Now they have arranged with an insulin manufacturer to supply their stores with insulin products which they will offer to customers at significantly lower prices. That’s very good news.

It’s not just Mozilla. Employers across the country from Fortune 500 companies such as PepsiCo and Verizon to boutique advertising firms and nonprofit organizations are continuing pandemic benefits such as increased paid time off and child- or elder-care benefits as well as embracing flexible work schedules and remote work in recognition that a returning workforce is at high risk of burnout. Fidelity is granting U.S. full-time and part-time employees five additional paid “relief days” for unexpected events as well as elder- and child-care coordinators to help find and vet caregivers or tutors. The fund manager also expanded a program to help parents of children with behavioral or developmental disabilities. Marriott International is adding three paid “TakeCare Days Off” on the Fridays before Memorial Day July Fourth and Labor Day for non-hotel staffers. The world’s largest hotel chain also “strongly encourages teams” to avoid all meetings on Fridays. If a critical meeting must take place “we ask that it be concluded by no later than noon local time” Sarah Brown Marriott’s director of corporate media relations wrote in an email. Indicting the Trump Organization Could Be Just the Start Barbara McQuade Daily Beast June 29 2021. First prosecutors have confidence in their case. They are willing to put their evidence to the test by showing their cards to the organization’s lawyers. ✂️ The second inference we can draw is that charges seem likely. A report in the Wall Street Journal indicates that Trump Organization lawyer Ronald Fischetti did not use a Monday meeting to dispute the evidence but instead argued that the alleged misconduct should get a pass. ✂️ Because the meeting between the lawyers appears to have been less than fruitful we can expect charges to be filed soon. Prosecutors do not make idle threats about filing charges. The third inference is that if charges are filed against the Trump Organization they may not be the last. ✂️ When corporate entities are charged often individual defendants are charged as well. Those charges could come later in what is known as a superseding indictment. So even if the Trump Organization is the only named defendant in an indictment this week that does not mean that individuals won’t be charged. It just means that they haven’t been charged yet. There are things Allen Weisselberg doesn't know about his own sons and his ex-daughter-in-law has the documents Sarah K Burris Raw Story June 29 2021. She explained that Weisselberg thinks that he knows everything going on inside the Trump Organization every day but there are some things he's not aware of involving his son. She wouldn't reveal what specifically but she said "he is blind to the fact that he believes everything that Donald promised him and everything his sons are telling him." She told Melber that she has "proof to back up the fact that's just not true." It's a sentiment that Michael Cohen reiterated when he spoke out on Twitter Tuesday saying that the prosecutors already have all of the documents that they need. Fox News Agrees to $1 Million Fine for Violating Human Rights Law Lloyd Grove Daily Beast June 29 2021. Despite Fox News’ claims to have repaired the company’s toxic workplace culture since the firing of founder and chairman Roger Ailes in July 2016 Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has effectively admitted to ongoing misconduct that includes sexual harassment discrimination and retaliation against victimized employees and has agreed to pay a million-dollar fine for what New York City’s Commission on Human Rights called “a pattern of violating of the NYC Human Rights Law.” The settlement agreement reached last week with the human rights commission contains the largest-ever financial penalty assessed in the agency’s six-decade history and also requires Fox News to remove mandatory confidential arbitration clauses from the contracts of on-air talent along with other employees and contributors for a period of four years when they file legal claims under the city’s human-rights law outside of the company’s internal process. It “also demands immediate changes to policies surrounding reporting sexual harassment retaliation training and compliance with the NYC Human Rights Law” according to a statement from the commission which added: “The Commission will monitor the network on a quarterly basis for a period of 2 years to ensure compliance.” The battle to break up Big Tech has just begun Will Oremus Washington Post June 29 2021. Dismissal of FTC’s Facebook antitrust lawsuit may spur rewrite of law. Of course Big Tech was never going to go down without a fight. The past week capped by a stinging court rebuke Monday of the government’s case against Facebook has revealed just how far the nascent antitrust-reform movement has to go to achieve its most ambitious goals. But it has also clarified the path forward for today’s trustbusters with District Judge James E. Boasberg’s dismissive ruling handing them both a road map and a fresh tank of fuel. If the goal is to split up the tech giants “I think the Facebook ruling actually helps” said Hal Singer an antitrust economist who is managing director of the litigation consulting firm Econ One. “It will generate more votes and enthusiasm” for rewriting the laws to constrain dominant Internet platforms. ✂️ Antitrust experts have warned from the start that cutting the tech industry’s Goliaths down to size would take more than one slingshot — and likely many years. The first wave of trustbusting in the United States took the better part of two decades from the early 1900s to World War I. The federal antitrust case against Microsoft lasted nine years from the inquiry’s opening in 1992 to settlement in 2001. Anyone expecting a quick end to the battle over Big Tech was misguided. The same goes for anyone who now thinks Facebook is in the clear. For one thing the judge dismissed the FTC’s complaint without prejudice offering a blueprint for it to address his objections and a 30-day window to refile. It will do so under the leadership of Khan who was sworn in June 15 as FTC chair. It’s a chance for Khan to put her stamp on a suit that was initially filed under a Republican-led FTC last year in what some critics felt was a rushed process. Documents Show Ivanka Trump Didn’t Testify Accurately in Inauguration Scandal Case David Corn Mother Jones June 28 2021. During a December 1 deposition—in which she swore to tell the truth—Ivanka Trump the eldest daughter of Donald Trump who was an executive at the Trump Organization before becoming a White House adviser to her father was asked if she had any “involvement in the process of planning the inauguration.” She replied “I really didn’t have an involvement.” Ivanka testified that if her “opinion was solicited” regarding an inauguration event she “would give feedback to my father or to anyone who asked my perspective or opinion.” And that was as far as her participation went.  But this wasn’t accurate according to the documents which indicate she was part of the decision-making for various aspects of the inauguration including even the menus for events. One email chain shows that Ivanka Trump was directly involved in the planning of at least one proposed event for the inauguration. On November 29 2016 Rick Gates then the deputy chairman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee (known as the PIC) emailed her the current schedule of inauguration events. He noted that Stephanie Winston Wolkoff a lead producer working with the PIC “is going to call you to discuss some additional ideas she has about some other events that we would like to see if you would be willing to do based on our meetings.” Ivanka replied to Gates and Winston Wolkoff “Great. I am looping in my assistant Suzie who can coordinate a time for us to connect.” There's a word for this: PERJURY. https://t.co/iLe3NqlOlB pic.twitter.com/Z47ke9Z6Ho  This story is going viral across the world. Everybody loves to laugh at the McCloskeys it seems. https://t.co/cXObKHZbtP Alabama officials CANCELS Trump rally at the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park because they were concerned it would be 'too partisan' Katelyn Caralle Daily Mail June 29 2021. A park commission in Mobile Alabama cancelled a July 3 event where Donald Trump was scheduled as the keynote speaker after the chairman claimed the event was becoming 'too partisan.' 'After the request was made then there was contact with the Republican Party they contacted us and then it became apparent that it was going to be a partisan political event rather than just a patriotic event planned for that evening' commission chairman Bill Tunnell told a local NBC affiliate in Alabama. Trump according to the report was supposed to be the keynote speaker at a Saturday event at the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile Alabama – the day before Independence Day.  Florida's governor did better than Trump in a Republican straw poll. Now he's scared to death that Trump's is going to turn against him. https://t.co/3M2w19t9Hz Disaster For Republicans As Arizona Ballot Audit Totally Backfires Jason Easley Politicus June 29 2021. The Trump-driven Arizona ballot audit has backfired as nearly half of Arizona voters oppose it and it has added to support for President Biden.  By 49-46 percent Arizona voters are opposed to the audit which puts the result within the poll’s margin of error. But the survey of 600 likely voters found that the intensity of opposition to the audit exceeded the intensity of support with those strongly opposed to it outnumbering those strongly in favor by 5 percentage points. And while Democrats and Republicans broke along familiar partisan lines independent voters upon whom the state pivots in close elections opposed the audit by 18 percentage points. In a head-to-head rematch in Arizona the poll shows Biden edges Trump by 51-44 percent. The poll which was conducted June 17 through June 23 has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Arizona is no longer a red state. It is a swing state and the only thing that Arizona Republicans accomplished with their ballot was to alienate and enrage non-Republican voters. Republicans in other states would be wise to stay far far away from this idea. The Trump-driven Arizona ballot audit has backfired as nearly half of Arizona voters oppose it and it has added to support for President Biden. https://t.co/BK0nZDtaDy via @politicususa  Today’s first @washingtonpost quarantine TikTok is the Arizona audit so far https://t.co/uDk5slT1Oq pic.twitter.com/t6VYLPPjaO  Trump's Ohio Speech: 'Scores Of People Left Early' — SAD! Crooks and Liars June 29 2021. Dozens of people walked out of a rally in Ohio over the weekend as former President Donald Trump was speaking. ✂️ "Yet in the audience and on the stage the scene in Ohio on Saturday was reflective of how diminished Mr. Trump has become in his post-presidency and how reliant he is on a smaller group of allies and supporters who have adopted his alternate reality as their own" New York Times correspondent Jeremy Peters explained. "One of the event's headliners was Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia the far-right Republican who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory." "Mr. Trump's speech — low-key digressive and nearly 90 minutes long — fell flat at times with an otherwise adoring audience" the report added. "Scores of people left early as he bounced from topic to topic — immigration Israel Speaker Nancy Pelosi's protective mask." Nevada pageant winner to become 1st transgender Miss USA contestant Dan Avery NBC June 29 2021. Kataluna Enriquez who was crowned Miss Nevada USA on Sunday will become the first openly transgender woman to compete in the Miss USA pageant. With a platform centered on transgender awareness and mental health Enriquez 27 beat out 21 other contestants at the South Point Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. “I didn’t have the easiest journey in life” she said according to KVVU-TV. “I struggled with physical and sexual abuse. I struggled with mental health. I didn’t have much growing up. I didn’t have support. But I’m still able to thrive and I’m still able to survive and become a trailblazer for many.” After her win Enriquez thanked the LGBTQ community on Instagram writing “My win is our win. We just made history. Happy Pride.” Kataluna thank you for being a powerful voice for equality and inspiring others in the LGBTQ+ community to live freely as themselves. Our state is so proud of you. #Pride https://t.co/s8hzvVujWU   To LGBTQ+ folks across the country — no matter where you are on your journey — know you are loved and accepted just as you are. pic.twitter.com/e0vpSBkwFV  Cosmic gulp: Astronomers see black hole swallow neutron star Seth Borenstein AP News June 29 2021. Talk about a heavy snack. For the first time astronomers have witnessed a black hole swallowing a neutron star the most dense object in the universe — all in a split-second gulp.✂️ Ten days later they saw the same thing on the other side of the universe. In both cases a neutron star — a teaspoon of which would weigh a billion tons — orbits ever closer to that ultimate point of no return a black hole until they finally crash together and the neutron star is gone in a gobble. ✂️ Neutron stars are corpses of massive stars what’s leftover after a big star dies in a supernova explosion. They are so dense that they have about 1.5 to two times the mass of our sun but condensed to about 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide Brady said. Some black holes known as stellar black holes are created when an even bigger star collapses into itself creating something with such powerful gravity that not even light can escape. ⚡️ Yer Wonkette: Manhattan DA Notifies Trump Lawyers 'F*ck Around' Season Is Over Time To Find Out Liz Dye June 28 2021. ⚡️ Outrage Won’t Save Our Damaged Democracy.
