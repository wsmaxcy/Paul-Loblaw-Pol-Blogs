C, Should concern over “hate crimes” influence American foreign policy?, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-03-21, The mainstream media is  struggling to reconcile its attacks on Donald Trump for speaking harshly about nations like China and Iran with its approval of (or at least non-judgmental posture towards) Joe Biden doing the same thing. To this struggle we can add the task of defending Biden’s anti-China rhetoric while continuing to blame Trump’s rhetoric for “hate crimes” against Asian-Americans.  Two Asian-American professors Viet Thanh Nguyen and Janelle Wong have written  an article for the Washington Post called (in the paper edition) “This is what happens when you vilify Asia.” “This” means the murders of Asian sex workers in Atlanta. The article is silly at several levels. First there is no evidence I’m aware of that the Atlanta shootings were motivated by  anything other than a loathing of prostitutes (a form of self-loathing given the shooter’s penchant for frequenting massage parlors).  Second no U.S. official has “vilified Asia” per se. Particular Asian regimes have been criticized based on their policies. China’s and North Korea’s are the modern examples. But in recent times U.S. officials and politicians have also been highly critical of Russia Cuba Venezuela and even Israel.  Third U.S. officials and politicians should continue strongly to criticize our adversaries including Asian ones. We cannot conduct foreign policy based on the extent if any to which our policies and pronouncements might affect the treatment of citizens with roots in a given nation or conduct. Wokeness and political correctness cannot override legitimate foreign policy objectives. Nguyen and Wong acknowledge that there are grounds on which China fairly can be criticized. But then they quickly resort to good old-fashion moral equivalency arguments.  They note that “China has not routinely used bombings and drone strikes as tools of foreign policy or established military bases in dozens of nations” as America has. They also claim that like China the U.S. “uses widespread surveillance against its own population” and goes even further to employ “espionage and covert action on foreign populations — including in efforts to weaken and overthrow governments with which it does not agree from Iran to Guatemala [note: almost 70 years ago].”  These are Red China’s talking points including some of the very ones used by China in its 20 minute anti-American harangue in Anchorage.  If you believe that the U.S. and China are about equally horrible then yes it is hypocritical (though perhaps still in the national interest) to criticize the Chinese communists. But if you understand that China is a deeply repressive expansionist dictatorship and that the U.S. isn’t then our leaders should not feel constrained in criticizing China even if it could be demonstrated (and I doubt that it can be) that their criticism is producing an appreciable increase in offenses against Asian-American.  Nguyen and Wong manage to get one thing right. They emphasize that criticism of China by American officials and politicians is bipartisan. Indeed they say that China is “one of the few issues about which Democrats and Republicans agree.” That’s true at least when it comes to talk.  The question becomes whether now that Biden and his Secretary of State are harshly calling China out the media will blame crimes against Asian-Americans on the administration’s anti-China rhetoric. I think we know the answer to that one. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
