L, Cartoon: On The Fence Page 12 - Family's Gotta Schtick Together, Partofthesolution, 2021-04-26, I’m feeling a sense of renewal this Monday we made it past the Chauvin trial with a good outcome (so far) and no outbreaks of social unrest. Spring is here and it’s time to return to the outside world vaccines are available to those who want them and cases against Former Guy are proceeding. Ahh the smell of indictments in the morning does my old heart good! Here’s page 12 of On The Fence all the pages of which can be found at onthefencecomic.com along with other art and commentary. Have a great Monday!
