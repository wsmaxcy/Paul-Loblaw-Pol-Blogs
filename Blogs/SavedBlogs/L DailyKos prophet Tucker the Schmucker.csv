L, Tucker the Schmucker, prophet, 2021-04-27, Tucker “The Schmucker” Carson (would use a different nickname but this is a family forum) is deadly wrong about mask wearing—again. Seriously this guy needs a wad of duct tape in and over his mouth. And a surgical mask. And a Halloween mask. First of all masks protect others from you. Not the other way around. This is due to the way air circulates around a mask when a person breaths coughs or sneezes. Fauci recommends wearing masks outdoors. He wears a mask in his car so it is apparent he wears a mask outdoors. It is estimated that 1 in 1000 people can catch the coronavirus outdoors. That’s 382200 infections. In China it’s 1 in every 7324 or 190879 infections (beats the crap out of the US but what else is new). It’s not clear how many of those infected wore masks. Masks reduce infections by 65%. We know what happens to some people who die of Covid 19. It’s a nasty death and a lonely death. You probably wish it on your worst enemies but that’s where the line stops. Kids do get the virus. Even if kids don’t contract the virus directly they can get it from others (even if kids wear masks though the risk is much less). The worst consequence to kids getting covid 19 is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). This is an inflammatory syndrome of numerous bodily systems—heart lungs blood vessels kidneys digestive system brain skin and eyes. Most kids recover with medical care. Some don’t and risk their lives. Without treatment (symptoms can be difficult to interpret) survivors can end up with permanent damage; permanent like for the rest of their lives. There are no second chances when it comes to the health of your kids. NO. SECOND. CHANCES. Too many people know and regret this. Tucker the Schmucker has 4 kids (older now so their risk of infection is higher. Tucker their risk is HIGHER. If you have any private integrity demonstrated at home you’d have your kids wear masks outside. Telling folks not to wear masks is bad advice. Telling people to harass others wearing masks is a prelude to incitement. Those people not wearing masks and getting in people's faces ie less than 6 feet is exposing those mask-less people to charges of terrorism. The Justice Department (under Trump surprise surprise) considers the threat of infection by a biological agent (of which the coronavirus is one) an act of terrorism. Domestic terrorism. So at worst (in Tucker’s case the best?) scenario is that Tucker the Schmucker is inciting people to commit acts of domestic terrorism.
