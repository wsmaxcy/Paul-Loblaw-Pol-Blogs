L, Newsmax Settles Dominion's Defamation Suit & Admits Lying & Trying to Ruin Man's Reputation., TheCriticalMind, 2021-05-01, On Friday Newsmax issued a grovelling statement admitting to their despicable reporting of the ‘rigged election’ lie. They enumerated the falsity of their claims. Confessed to their sins. And apologized to an executive at Dominion Voting Systems Dr Eric Coomer for their scurrilous accusations that he had attended ‘Antifa meetings’ and had been active in manipulating the election results. Here is their admission: Since Election Day various guests attorneys and hosts on Newsmax have offered opinions and claims about Dr. Eric Coomer the Director of Product Strategy and Security at Dominion Voting Systems. Newsmax would like to clarify its coverage of Dr. Coomer and note that while Newsmax initially covered claims by President Trump’s lawyers supporters and others that Dr. Coomer played a role in manipulating Dominion voting machines Dominion voting software and the final vote counts in the 2020 presidential election Newsmax subsequently found no evidence that such allegations were true. Many of the states whose results were contested by the Trump campaign after the November 2020 election have conducted extensive recounts and audits and each of these states certified the results as legal and final. They added:  “There are several facts that our viewers should be aware of. Newsmax has found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so. Nor has Newsmax found any evidence that Dr. Coomer ever participated in any conversation with members of “Antifa” nor that he was directly involved with any partisan political organization.” And concluded: On behalf of Newsmax we would like to apologize for any harm that our reporting of the allegations against Dr. Coomer may have caused to Dr. Coomer and his family.  For more on this please go to our website at Newsmax.com and read “Facts About Dominion Smartmatic You Should Know.” How did we — and Newsmax —  get here? After the election as the nation celebrated the return of sanity and compassion evinced by a Biden victory the badly-beaten loser grasped at straws to keep his fragile ego afloat. A flood of braggadocio stinking of desperation promoted the absolute absurdity of an election fraud repeatedly denied by state election officials; federal authorities; the courts state and federal; recounts; and audits. Sensing ratings gold conservative media reported every hint of a suggestion that the election had been ‘stolen’. Ultra right-wing opinionators shamelessly plugged theories based on the wispiest ‘evidence’ produced by casual onlookers. These high-paid MAGA-defenders solemnly repeated stories by witnesses who saw something ‘suspicious’. They told tales of state employees destroying ballots while Republican election-observers were banished to observation sites from which nothing could be seen. And for a short time all was exuberant nonsense pure hokum and quite obviously the machinations of lawyers with no regard for the law and bloviators with no regard for the truth. And while irresponsible. it would have been legal. However as they were laughed out of court and their legal losses mounted the lawyers constructed ever more fantastical tales. And the hype-hyenas of cable news gleefully reported ever jot and tittle of unsubstantiated tommyrot as gospel truth. And then they were sued. You can see it now. Panicked media execs made fearful calls to in-house lawyers and legal hired guns and got the news they dreaded. They were faced with financial ruin. The evidence was so overwhelming —  their disregard for truth propriety and other people’s reputations so patently callous that —  despite pro-forma counter-suits  —  they knew their fat was in the fire. Settlement became inevitable. And on Friday Newsmax became the first to do so. Sometimes these agreements are a private affair. A certain amount of cash is forked over on condition that the victims of the slander never speak of it — or reveal the amount of the resolution. But in Newsmax’s case satisfaction was only realized with a public admission of the facts of the case. And thus their statement. Other organizations will also pay up and make public apologies. The lawyers will also negotiate whatever private settlements they can. And although the deep-pocketed ‘Fox News’s of this world will pay out I suspect that personal and professional bankruptcies will limit the recovery from the lawyers. The big hurt for these legal leaches will be the loss of their license to practice law. The once profitable road to notoriety will be closed. For most the punishment will be financial and reputational. But for one toothy drunk a federal facility may well be his fate.
