C, Who’s the Biggest Terrorist Threat?, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-29, Last night Joe Biden repeated the absurd claim that according go our intelligence agencies white supremacists are our number one terrorist threat. Let me know when white supremacists burn down a city or two; until then I am going with Antifa. This Antifa video describes the far-left movement in honest–i.e. openly terrorist–terms. It includes a threat to kill Ted Wheeler the hapless left-wing mayor of Portland and helpfully includes his home address. If you want to see a terrorist threat this is it: pic.twitter.com/JzS9n2QFWR — nefelibata33_ (@knotathreat) April 29 2021  
By the way it appears that this video does not infringe Twitter’s terms of service. Keep that in mind next time they cancel a conservative for something a great deal less serious than threatening to kill a public official. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
