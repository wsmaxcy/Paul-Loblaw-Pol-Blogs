L, Top Comments: Condiments Edition, brilligforTop Comments, 2021-05-10, I assume most households have a basic set of condiments around: I’m guessing ketchup mustard mayonnaise are the basic set with a bottle of hot sauce and possibly a bottle of soy sauce as extras. But I’m also willing to guess that each of you has a favorite something and you have a collection in the kitchen. In our house it’s primarily hot sauce/seasoning. As you can see in the photo above we have a lot of hot sauce. That picture doesn’t include three BBQ sauces in the refrigerator (two regular and one homemade keto spicy batch) the shaker bottle of Ethiopian (yes imported) berbere spice and the multiple bottles of hot sauce in the pantry because we recognized we might have too many open at once! We each have our favorites: Mr. Brillig is favoring either the pukka sauce or chipotle Tabasco while K2 heads directly for Cholula. Me I prefer either berbere or sriracha. At one point after our visit to New Orleans for Netroots Nation we had a gallon bottle of the chipotle Tabasco with a pump and that lasted a little under two years.  The large bottle of Franks is primarily for making what K2 calls Orange Chicken… basically chicken breasts cooked in the instantpot with butter and Franks Hot Sauce then shredded. Many of the others were from a monthly hot-n-spicy subscription box because pandemic :). Astute observers might notice a stray bottle of soy sauce in the background. My years in graduate school in the heart of Boston’s Chinatown gave me an appreciation for the varieties of soy sauce so we have regular low-sodium aged and also tamari because it’s lower-carb.  What’s in your kitchen? What favorite condiment did I forget? What do you have more than just one of?
