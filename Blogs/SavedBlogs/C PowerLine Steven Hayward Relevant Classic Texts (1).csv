C, Relevant Classic Texts (1), Steven Hayward, 2021-05-27, From time to time I post excerpts from classic authors that bear on the current scene especially C.S. Lewis’s anticipations of postmodern nihilism and progressivism in works such as The Abolition of Man and The Screwtape Letters. It strikes me that we should have a regular Power Line series on classic texts to keep handy. I previously quoted The Screwtape Letters on progressivism but in the sequel Lewis wrote almost 20 years later (1962) for the Saturday Evening Post “Screwtape Proposes a Toast” there appear several passages that predict with uncanny accuracy what the left is doing to education today—specifically things like Virginia abolishing entrance tests for elite high schools and eliminating advanced math classes. (Keep in mind if you aren’t familiar with the ironic literary device Lewis employed in Screwtape that the speaker is a devil-figure instructing other junior Satanic agents on how to corrupt humans): What I want to fix your attention on is the vast overall movement towards the discrediting and finally the elimination of every kind of human excellence – moral cultural social or intellectual. And is it not pretty to notice how “democracy” (in the incantatory sense) is now doing for us the work that was once done by the most ancient Dictatorships and by the same methods? You remember how one of the Greek Dictators (they called them “tyrants” then) sent an envoy to another Dictator to ask his advice about the principles of government. The second Dictator led the envoy into a field of grain and there he snicked off with his cane the top of every stalk that rose an inch or so above the general level. The moral was plain. Allow no preeminence among your subjects. Let no man live who is wiser or better or more famous or even handsomer than the mass. Cut them all down to a level: all slaves all ciphers all nobodies. All equals. Thus Tyrants could practise in a sense “democracy.” But now “democracy” can do the same work without any tyranny other than her own. No one need now go through the field with a cane. The little stalks will now of themselves bite the tops off the big ones. The big ones are beginning to bite off their own in their desire to Be Like Stalks. . . Once you have grasped the tendency you can easily predict its future developments; especially as we ourselves will play our part in the developing. The basic principle of the new education is to be that dunces and idlers must not be made to feel inferior to intelligent and industrious pupils. That would be “undemocratic.” These differences between pupils – for they are obviously and nakedly individual differences – must be disguised. This can be done at various levels. At universities examinations must be framed so that nearly all the students get good marks. Entrance examinations must be framed so that all or nearly all citizens can go to universities whether they have any power (or wish) to profit by higher education or not. At schools the children who are too stupid or lazy to learn languages and mathematics and elementary science can be set to doing things that children used to do in their spare time. Let them for example make mud pies and call it modelling. But all the time there must be no faintest hint that they are inferior to the children who are at work. Whatever nonsense they are engaged in must have – I believe the English already use the phrase – “parity of esteem.” An even more drastic scheme is not possible. Children who are fit to proceed to a higher class may be artificially kept back because the others would get a trauma — Beelzebub what a useful word! – by being left behind. The bright pupil thus remains democratically fettered to his own age group throughout his school career and a boy who would be capable of tackling Aeschylus or Dante sits listening to his coeval’s attempts to spell out A CAT SAT ON A MAT. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
