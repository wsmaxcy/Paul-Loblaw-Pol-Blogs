C, Flynn Jr: Trump Campaign Statement on Powell has to do with Legal Funding, John Cleer, 2020-11-23, https://parler.com/post/70a5aac24a104f2e83ef4020b60fb0e0 Michael Flynn Jr · @mflynnJR 17 hours ago · Wrt the @JennaEllisEsq press release Cannot confirm yet but I’m confident this has to do w money coming in for legal defense fund sppt @SidneyPowell has her own separate entity 4 legal donations that isn’t in conjunction w the Trump legal team Frees SP 2 do her own thing…which will STILL b biblical. Give this the 24 hour rule….     President Trump didn’t “disown” Sydney Powell and it wasn’t a wild statement from his campaign that distanced Powell and you can disregard any RINO’s who say otherwise. The president’s campaign and legal team have specific rules to meet regarding funding. There’s also the question of liability regarding Powell’s press conferences: if she makes accusations against Dominion (which she has already has repeatedly) as a member of the Trump campaign Dominion could sue the Trump campaign for defamation. Would they win? NO. But that would give the Trump campaign another obstacle and another judge and they’re already working under a tight deadline. Further there are political implications as Powell has accused Trump’s supposed ally Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia of getting kickbacks from Dominion Voting Systems in a pay-for-play scheme. Kemp like Nancy Pelosi has a former Chief of Staff lobbying for Dominion; unlike Pelosi however he is a Republican and there will be other Republicans implicated in Georgia (which Powell says “is probably going to be the first state I’m blowing up”) and President Trump might not want to start a fight with his own party in the middle of all of this. He likely will also want to avoid accusations that he is prosecuting his political opponents. So it’s perfectly sensible for the Trump Campaign to “officially” distance themselves from Powell right now and she’s said she agrees with it. It also bears little relationship to the outcome of the election or any of the lawsuits regarding election fraud. On Saturday Jordan Sekulow son of Trump’s longtime attorney Jay made a similar statement to Powell’s regarding the Georgia election. Powell’s censored tweet that earned her a 12-hour ban linked this article from the Bannon- and Giuliani-associated Chinese dissident who leaked what were likely blackmail pictures from Hunter Biden’s laptop last month. The article breaks down Soros’ and the CCP’s role in Dominion/Smartmatic/Sequoia vote rigging software. Nationwide Powell claims that Biden’s votes were “weighted” at around 1.25 times under Dominion algorithms while President Trump’s were weighted at .75 and 35000 votes were given to every Democratic candidate on the undercard in every race. Dominion by design she says allows administrators to drag and drop votes into the trash which they did. “I think the fraud went much further than just President Trump” she told Newsmax. “I think they did it to John James and others.” *** Across the country 7 million votes were taken from Trump by Powell’s count and 3 million dead people voted (probably all for Biden). This is much bigger news than the Trump campaign’s announcement which appears to have been a formality. Why aren’t more conservatives talking about this? The evidence for all this will have to play out in the courts and Powell is one of the top lawyers in the country. Reading pseudonomous clickbait writers call her a “conspiracy theorist”  misrepresent the Trump campaign and demoralize Trump’s base makes my blood boil. What about you? Are you ok with that??     ***EDIT: Powell’s phrasing was ambiguous and I misunderstood it. She told Newsmax We have other testimonial evidence that appears to be coming in now that indicates the Democrats literally added 35000 votes to every Democrat candidate to begin with… Definitely all over one state and I’d be willing to bet it happened everywhere. It’s since come out that the “one state” she had direct evidence for is Arizona.   (Crossposted to https://abcu8.co/2020/11/23/flynn-jr-trump-campaign-statement-on-powell-has-to-do-with-legal-funding/) This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.
