L, Second Time Around, ReasonaBill, 2021-05-10, For the second time in approximately sixteen years President Joe Biden is part of a multicultural team pulling America back from the brink. The last time in 2009 Mr. Biden was second in command to former President Barack Obama. This time he is in charge with Kamala Harris as his VP. Republicans were quick to admonish the current President for what is being described as anemic hiring numbers for April; while at the same time neglecting the fact that Mr. Biden presided over a 1.3 million jobs gain in 4 months more than any other chief executive before him. During the first round of cleaning up the last Republican economic mess the final 3 years of the Obama administration created over eight million jobs the numbers fell under the Trump administration to six million. As Obama’s dance partner during the crucial period of saving the economy Mr. Biden knows the dance steps and is prepared for the second time around.   I shudder to think where we would be with Trump still in office    A new report was released as to the actual numbers of deaths due to the Covid-19 virus. The accepted number has been under 600000 but according to studies from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 900000 people have died in the U.S. Fortunately for the American public Joe Biden entered office ready to shoot vaccines from the hip. In a few months he increased vaccine manufacturing and distribution. Joe Biden told Americans the previous administration was a “dismal failure” on the coronavirus as others controversially said Trump “had no plan” for the distribution of the vaccine. Although Dr. Fauci refuted in part the accuracy of the no plan claim there was no dispute that the Trump administration was woefully under-prepared.  I can only imagine…        The number of deaths so far as a result of the Coronavirus will affect not only the grieving families ad-infinitum but the world economy for decades. Instead of the confident and intelligent leadership we elected in November of 2020 we could still have a delusional president who stated over the weekend that a horse was a junkie. “So now even our Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit is a junky (sic)” Trump wrote.  “This is emblematic of what is happening to our Country. The whole world is laughing at us as we go to hell on our Borders our fake Presidential Election and everywhere else!” Republicans constantly troll Joe Biden over his mental competence I think they should look in their own backyard. Tan suits Dr. Seuss or bleary-eyed horses cannot excuse the party that is ready to toss out its leadership for a lie.  Mr. Biden is proving to be much more of a  Roosevelt Democrat than anyone expected. I hope he dares to tackle the irrational amounts of guns on the streets not those in cabin gun racks. As a member of an inner-city community victimized by gun manufacturers I pray that he keeps the commitment to rid the streets of illegal guns. Declaring gun violence a public health issue is a beginning. The 2nd Amendment is not sacrosanct;  The world has come a long way since muskets and log cabins. Republicans need to realize the Constitution is not a religious document but a living testament to the benefit of change. Conservatives like to say the Founders were wise beyond their years but refuse to believe they knew America’s needs would shift.  Continue to Vote for Change.
