C, DOJ sues Georgia over its voting law, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-06-25, The Biden Justice Department announced yesterday that  it is suing Georgia over the voting procedures the state recently adopted. The suit alleges civil rights violations under Section 2 of he Voting Rights Act. It will be prosecuted by Kristen Clarke the racist head of the Civil Rights Division with the help presumably of her brainy principal deputy  Pam Karlan. On the merits the lawsuit is a joke. As  Andy McCarthy says: 
The law provides for voting far more extensive than the Constitution’s minimal standards and well beyond what about five minutes ago were state-law norms.
 In my opinion there is no chance that a reasonable court will back the DOJ’s position on the Georgia voting law. Also I see no chance that if called upon the Supreme Court would uphold a ruling in the DOJ’s favor. Perhaps Team Biden-Clarke hopes for a good draw at the district court and appellate levels and thinks that maybe just maybe the Supreme Court won’t have time to act before the 2022 election in which Georgia likely will be a key battleground state in the battle for control of the Senate. Or maybe Team Biden-Clarke simply feels compelled by ideology and its base to take a stand however absurd against the Georgia law. At a minimum the Dems can probably raise funds off of the suit. I figure soon to be getting spam for that purpose from Nancy Pelosi Rafael Warnock and Keisha Lance Bottoms with headers like “Paul this message is tough to write” and “this is jaw dropping.” I agree with McCarthy’s conclusion: 
These are still early Biden days. He may not be able to get much legislation through Congress but there are no brakes on the Civil Rights Division — except the courts.
