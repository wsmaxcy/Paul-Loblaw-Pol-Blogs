L, AMERICA’S SILVER TSUNAMI: Aging Prisoners Face Disastrous Conditions Disease Dementia and Death, Bill Berkowitz, 2021-06-30, “Prisons in the United States contain an ever growing number of aging men and women who cannot readily climb stairs haul themselves to the top bunk or walk long distances to meals or the pill line; whose old bones suffer from thin mattresses and winter’s cold; who need wheelchairs walkers canes portable oxygen and hearing aids; who cannot get dressed go to the bathroom or bathe without help; and who are incontinent forgetful suffering chronic illnesses extremely ill and dying.” — “Old Behind Bars: The Again Prison Population in the United States” Human Rights Watch  They are aging more rapidly than those on the outside. They face challenges that are often torturous. They are at high risk for COVID-19 and susceptible to all sorts of other illnesses as well as the onset of dementia. They are vulnerable and often helpless. They are America’s incarcerated senior citizens. While some senior citizens in prison were given early release and were spared getting coronavirus if you are an aging prisoner in the US 50 is the new 65.    This phenomenon is called “accelerated aging” and according to the Urban Institute’s KiDeuk Kim and Bryce Peterson “the physiological age of some older prisoners is up to 15 years greater than their chronological age.” This is in stark contrast to outside prison walls where our youth-oriented culture labels “40 as the new 30” “60 as the new 50” and so on. “In America over 203000 people are serving life sentences in prison more than the country’s entire prison population in 1970” The Washington Post’s Tom Jackman reported in early March. “Of the lifers 30 percent are at least 55 years old. And according to a new study by the Sentencing Project more than two-thirds of those serving life in prison are people of color.”  In essence life sentences have become death sentences.   The Marshall Project’s Lisa Armstrong (in partnership with Mother Jones) recently reported (https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/06/29/lost-opportunity-lost-lives) that “There are 148815 people over the age of 55 in state prisons according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The pandemic provided an opportunity to do what advocates politicians — both Democrats and Republicans — and others have long recommended: Significantly reduce the prison population in this case by releasing older adults and others most medically vulnerable to protect them from the virus.  Between March and June 2020 just as the coronavirus pandemic was taking off in the country state and federal prison populations dropped by more than 100000 people according to a study by the Marshall Project and the Associated Press “driven in part by efforts to release low-risk and elderly people” Rep. Earl Blumenauer wrote in the Portland Tribune in mid-June.   According to Blumenauer “Across the country one in five people in prison have tested positive for the coronavirus compared to one in 20 in the general population. Tragically nearly 3000 incarcerated people have passed away.” The Silver Tsunami  One of the biggest issues facing prisoners and prison staff and authorities is the onset of dementia among prisoners which Rachel Lopez an Associate Professor of Law at Drexel University labeled a “silver tsunami” (https://theconversation.com/prisoners-in-us-suffering-dementia-may-hit-200-000-within-the-next-decade-many-wont-even-know-why-they-are-behind-bars-138236). In June of last year Lopez wrote: “Prison officials are bracing for a silver tsunami that will flood correctional facilities with elderly and often vulnerable prisoners.”  Like the rest of the United States population the prison population is aging fast. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2030 people over the age of 55 will account for almost one-third of all incarcerated people. That means that American prisons will house upward of 400000 older prisoners about the same population of New Orleans representing a near doubling of the number of older prisoners currently behind bars.  Lopez noted that “America’s large aging U.S. prison population is the direct result of the ‘tough on crime’ policies of the 1980s and 1990s when three-strike laws and mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole condemned many to die behind bars. The Federal Bureau of Prisons spends approximately US$881 million per year caring for the elderly in their custody.”   The effects of dementia among aging prisoners are profound and “compounded by incarceration” Lopez pointed out. “Because of their profound impairments people with dementia are sometimes unable to understand that they are in a prison much less why. Elderly prisoners with dementia are also at an increased risk of victimization sexual assault and bullying from other prisoners.  “Additionally because they struggle to understand and follow prison rules they are also more likely to be subjected to harsh punishment while incarcerated. Some are punished with solitary confinement which further degrades their physical and mental health.”    It is clear that older prisoners face numerous hardships and injustices from incarceration including: having their chronic health conditions ignored or mistreated; physical threats from younger prisoners; the need for special equipment including wheelchairs and walkers to be able to ambulate around their prisons; difficulties climbing on and off top bunks; trouble hearing making it challenging to discern orders from guards; and mental health issues many of which are the result of prolonged imprisonment. In a report titled “Aging Behind Bars: Trends and Implications of Graying Prisoners in the Federal Prison System” Kim and Peterson emphasize that “While this may be caused by a host of related factors — including histories of unhealthy behaviors and inadequate healthcare — there is little doubt that the trauma and stress of the prison environment can have an impact on prisoners’ accelerated aging and deterioration of health.” Kim and Peterson point out that “Not only do older prisoners require more treatment and medical care than younger prisoners their needs may also require more time and effort from the prison staff such as when a staff member gives them medicine or monitors their daily chores. Staff may also need to provide more surveillance and protection to older prisoners as they are more likely than younger prisoners to experience physical injuries and victimization.” According to “Aging Behind Bars” “The annual cost of incarcerating an individual age 50 and older has been estimated at $68270 double the cost of a younger offender. This estimate equates to $16 billion a year spent on older inmates nationally even though they make up less than 20 percent of the total prison population.” The report also points out that: * “The growth rate of older prisoners varies across offense type gender and race” and “the proportion of older female prisoners is growing faster than that of older male prisoners and providing health care services to aging women generally costs substantially more.”  * “The fiscal burden of aging prisoners is applicable to a wide range of prison operations (e.g. medical supplies welfare services treatment training) not just the upkeep of medical housing units.”  * “If prisoners age 50 and older cost three times more than younger prisoners the per person cost of [imprisoning] and programs in BOP would be approximately $9000 for those below age 50 and $27000 for those age 50 and older.”  * “At five times more older prisoners can consume up to one-half of the BOP’s total allocation for [imprisoning them] (approximately $1.2 billion in FY 2012).”  Unless systemic changes are instituted on a national level the aging prison population will continue to grow as will the cost of incarcerating them. The trend of privatization which is popular with many politicians is not a viable or just solution as the privatizer’s interests in profits trumps the possibility of ideally releasing them or short of that improving their conditions.  But their accelerated aging is likely due as the “Aging Behind Bars: Trends and Implications of Graying Prisoners in the Federal Prison System” report notes to being in prison in the first place and subject to an inhumane stressful and dangerous environment.  As noted above the ideal option would be the release of elderly prisoners because their continued incarceration neither serves their wellbeing nor that of society. However that requires breaking with the United States’ harmful infatuation with incarceration having the highest percentage of people behind bars in the world. It would also necessitate providing community support systems for the ex-offenders once they are released.  “Elders are needlessly dying in prison when they could be safely returned back to their families and home communities” said Jose Saldana who served 38 years in New York State prisons and is now director of Release Aging People in Prison (RAPP). “The only thing that stops a 75-year-old man who has been imprisoned for almost five decades from being released is vengeance. That’s the only thing. It's not justice; it's vengeance.”
