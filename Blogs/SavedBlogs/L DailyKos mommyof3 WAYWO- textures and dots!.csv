L, WAYWO- textures and dots!, mommyof3, 2021-05-09,  What Are You Working On? is for all things hand-made home-made and creative in a variety of mediums. I am on a bit of a crochet kick at the moment. I think it’s because it’s the fiber art medium I am the most efficient in… my grandmother taught me to crochet when I was in kindergarten so I have literally been doing it for all of my conscious memory. Once I get a stitch pattern rolling I can zip right through most projects. I also love the textures that crocheting creates in the pieces I make. It’s amazing what you can make using simple chains with single and double stitches! The baby afghan in the opening picture is a combination of herringbone half-doubles and double crochet bobbles and I loved the combination. I finished last September for my great-nephew.   I decided I loved the polka dots the bobbles created and made a pillow for the now nineteen year old daughter. It’s amazing how the bobbles pop out in the darker yarn! I am a math educator so of course this pillow became an image for discussing repeated addition and arrays!  I am now in the middle of two crochet projects… taking turns depending on my mood.  This is a sweater for ME… with yarn I was gifted for Christmas. I will work on it in spells for the next couple of months. It will be a nice comfy layering sweater.   The other project I am working on is for a family friend— a pair of pillows for her new apartment when she goes to college in the fall. She loved the dots on my daughter’s… so she gets even more dots! This one is fun to work on...I just started this weekend and it’s moving pretty fast.  So… what are you working on? Looking forward to see all the different projects in the comments!
