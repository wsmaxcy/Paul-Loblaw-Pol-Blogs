L, Moronic Fox Guest Calls Biden 'Dumb Bastard' â€” Kilmeade 'Understands', David, 2021-06-19, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Fox News host Brian Kilmeade admonished a guest on Thursday after he called President Joe Biden a "dumb bastard." The remark came as Kilmeade was interviewing Brian Dockter a technician who claimed to be out of work due to Biden's tax policies. "What is your message to Washington and to the John Kerrys of the world who tell you to go pick another profession?" Kilmeade asked. "Why doesn't he pick a different profession?" Dockter replied. "He's obviously not good at it so if anybody should lose a job it should be him and his cronies and Biden." "Biden's such a dumb bastard he just doesn't get anything" he added. "Yeah can't talk about the president like that" Kilmeade responded. "But I understand your frustration. Especially with politicians who see bar graphs and pie charts and not people. We like to see people here." "And I understand how you feel" the Fox News host concluded. For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
