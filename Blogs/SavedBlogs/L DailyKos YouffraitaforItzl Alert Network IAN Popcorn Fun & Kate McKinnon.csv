L, IAN: Popcorn Fun & Kate McKinnon, YouffraitaforItzl Alert Network, 2021-07-04, Many years ago when I was in college one of my roommates loved the Philly Inquirer...and one issue had a recipe for Pizza Popcorn. No kidding. Delicious! (It was also my go-to recipe in troll diaries back when kossacks did recipes in troll diaries.) My roommates and I had much fun munching pizza popcorn. Usually. There was this one time when I confused the paprika (key ingredient) and the cayenne pepper (oops). The recipe would have been published around 1977 I think. You pop the popcorn normally — I do it on a stovetop but I’ve been doing it that way since Mom taught me so you could say I’ve had a lot of practice — and then you toss it with the “pizza” seasonings: Melt the butter first and add the garlic oregano & paprika: mix well. Pour over the popcorn & then toss with the Parmesan. I never added salt b/c the Parm is salty enough; YMMV. I tried to find the recipe at Philly.com but came up empty (I guess it was too long ago) so the amounts are up to you.     A little something to watch with your pizza popcorn:  This one sounds weird to me but so many people go apeshit over ranch dressing or even ranch flavoring I have to include it. Ranch Popcorn: Ingredients: The instructions are:  www.tasteofhome.com/... More popcorn theater:  Buttery Cajun Popcorn looks good. I doubt you really have to air pop it — I certainly wouldn’t! Never had an air popper in my life! But the seasonings look delicious. Heh:  Here’s a video with recipes for cool ranch honey mustard BBQ and buffalo popcorns. BTW I never use coconut oil for popcorn (or anything else). Your regular cooking oil is fine. But they’re right about popping 3 kernels first to see when the oil is hot enough. Do that and with a bit of practice you will pop all but about 7 kernels burning none.  This is so sick I howled:  Wow I am totally not recommending this b/c it looks...highly unlikely. However it’s so weird it’s worth watching:  As a psychic in 2019 predicting 2020 (this one never gets old):  A fun fact about popcorn: It is a whole-grain snack. So if you eat it without too much butter or salt it’s good for you! Addenda: OMG Wanda Sykes!  Cannot resist adding: I’m staying at a house next to an old graveyard and just bought a hoodie with a gay witch on it. Goth Girl Summer is in full swing. pic.twitter.com/9lsvlj7V2M
