C, The Week in Pictures: Everbiden Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-03, That shipping container stuck in the Suez Canal for six days has to be some kind of metaphor for the Biden Administration and contemporary liberalism generally. It’s not much of a stretch to go from liberalism’s cargo cult mentality that the government is the provider of all good things by just spending money to having the flow of cargo stop because of incompetence stormy weather whatever. Here’s an idea: why don’t we send that ship to the southern border since it can halt massive amounts of traffic? Anyway we haven’t had this much fun since Chris Christie and Bernie Sanders started their Chair Sitting Meme Contest.                                                 Headlines of the week:           You know he could have done this in a day.                                         And finally. . .  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
