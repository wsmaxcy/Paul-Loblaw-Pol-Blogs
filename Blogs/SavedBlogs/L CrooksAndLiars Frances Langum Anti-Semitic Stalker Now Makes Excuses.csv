L, Anti-Semitic Stalker Now Makes Excuses, Frances Langum, 2021-05-27, Bigot and stalker of mass-shooting victims Marjorie Taylor Greene is in the "denial" stage of being a Republican troll.   Her racist and stupid comparison of House of Representative mask mandates to Jewish people being put on trains and sent to "gas chambers" is backfiring.  Here is the original clip where Greene directly compared the mask mandate to when Jews "were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany" ‚Äî i.e. The Holocaust. pic.twitter.com/NPs9bJWhpy ‚Äî Right Wing Watch (@RightWingWatch) May 27 2021 She tried earlier this week (on Steve Bannon's podcast smh) to use the excuse that her language was how "real Americans talk at their kitchen tables."  Marjorie Taylor Greene went on slimy Steve Bannon‚Äôs podcast Real America‚Äôs Voice to defend herself and her wingman Matt Gaetz. ‚ÄúI have done nothing wrong.‚Äù‚ÄúI speak exactly how real Americans talk at their kitchen tables.‚ÄùSMH pic.twitter.com/SMDTsq5L5D ‚Äî TheSadTruthüíô (@ReportsDaNews) May 27 2021 And now she is mincing her comments to pretend she never said the WORD "Holocaust" so it doesn't COUNT. I didn‚Äôt think someone could make me feel ill like Trump did but this trash is quickly proving I was wrong ‚Äî Time Warped Dad (@DadWarped) May 27 2021 Which is weird because the "station" she is appearing on has a website that is calling her trolling "Holocaust remarks."  Oops. I guess the website for the network interviewing her (America's Real Voice) didn't get the memo.  https://t.co/6Wz1jn7Ire pic.twitter.com/cVV7fZXmzc ‚Äî Frances Langum üß∂ (@bluegal) May 27 2021 We're done calling her by name.  She's the bigot troll from Georgia's 14th.   BONUS CONTENT:  Check out the wiki for Dr. Gina the host for the interview above.  There's just too much comedy gold to list here.
