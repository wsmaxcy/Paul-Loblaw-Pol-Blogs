L, Daunte Wright’s murder: Truth and the fallacy of facts, Roby NJ, 2021-04-19, There was a diary on the rec list today that purported to get the facts straight about the killing of Daunte Wright. That diary bothers me deeply. First of all anything that claims to present the “straight facts” is also making a claim that those facts are comprehensive and bias-free. And therefore implies that other narratives are false and/or superfluous. In addition a claim that these are the straight facts accepts their veracity and endorses them as the sole legitimate and valid facts that we need to be concerned with But to be clear the truth about this is far more than a privileged set of facts and only by seeing the truth can we ever find justice. The diary urges us not to exploit a a terrible situation by getting some of the facts wrong or forgetting other important facts. The problem is that those “facts” conceal distract and deceive. And we have every right to be indignant and angry at every single aspect of the official narrative. What facts are claimed? The truth? People drive around with expired tabs all the time. The Minnesota system is error-prone and unreliable. In no way is the lack of up-to-date tabs a universal imperative for a police traffic stop. It’s not only discretionary it’s always secondary to the real reason for the traffic stop. Which in far too many cases is driving while Black. Pulling over drivers based on skin color is the iceberg of deep systemic and institutional racism that pervades our criminal justice system. The police officer’s goal for those stops is motivated by racism: to run the plates check the drivers ID see if there are any outstanding warrants and look for anything that could possibly trigger a search for drugs. A white mother is rarely if ever going to be pulled over for failing to display current tabs and if she is the officer’s interaction will be admonishment not suspicion. So the very premise for Daunte’s traffic stop is a direct reflection of unacceptable and systemic racism. It doesn’t matter if it was for the tabs for a broken taillight or for a hanging air freshener. To claim that the distinction matters is offensive. 2. We’re supposed to note and remember the fact that Daunte was being arrested on a bench warrant for failing to appear in court for a misdemeanor hearing. But in the “straight facts” diary each time the diarist refers to the bench warrant it includes the phrase “…regarding illegal possession of a firearm.” Why do we keep seeing that superfluous information mentioned over and over again? It doesn’t matter what the misdemeanor charge was. A bench warrant compels the officers to take Daunte into custody regardless of the underlying misdemeanor. Its inclusion only serves to perpetuate (intentionally) the stereotyped narrative of the dangerous Black thug. Now I haven’t found any more details about that misdemeanor but it’s highly likely that ugly systemic and institutional racism is behind the misdemeanor charge itself and any number of details about why the failure to appear bench warrant came about. 3. And we’re also supposed to be understanding and remember that the officer believed she was firing a taser and that the officer’s behavior after she murdered Daunte shows that it was all just a tragic mistake that the officer regrets. But that’s all a lie. A lie rooted in racism. And the videotape shows why. The officer first grabs Daunte’s elbow with her right hand and reaches across his body to get Daunte’s license in her left hand. We see her quickly transfer his license to her right hand. Then as Daunte struggles to get back into his car she moves behind the first officer and announces to Daunte “I’ll taze ya” while transferring the license back to her left hand. Now her right hand is free to draw her service revolver. She says again “I’ll taze you.” then fires point blank into his chest. By the time she’s shouting “Taser taser taser” Daunte has already fallen into his car seat and we can see that blood from Daunte’s chest wound is dripping down onto his pants. To recap: when she sees that Daunte is not complying she moves around to face him unobstructed takes the license out of her right hand so she can draw her service weapon; she shoots him point-blank and only after fatally wounding him does she shout “Taser taser taser” to try to give her action some cover. Her move to draw her gun from her right side whether self-aware or not reflects conscious and subconcious racism. The deeply embedded racist impulse to subdue the dangerous Black man. THIS is the essence of all police murders of Black men. So yeah these are cold truths of Daunte Wright’s murder that are denied and concealed by a recitation of cherry-picked and biased “facts.” The people protesting Daunte’s murder in Brooklyn Center in Minneapolis and elsewhere know these truths. And they have every right to be defiant and angry until real justice is served.
