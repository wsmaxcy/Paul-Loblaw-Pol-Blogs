C, The real Joe Biden, Paul Mirengoff, 2021-01-21, If there’s any Joe Biden pose more phony than his purported moderation it’s his purported decency. Biden is not a decent person.  Plenty of examples to support this statement. The best one is set forth by  Kevin Williamson: 
Of all of Biden’s dishonesty — the plagiarism and other intellectual dishonesty the invented biographical episodes etc. — the one that sticks out the most to me is his lying repeatedly about the death of his first wife and child falsely claiming that they had been killed by a drunk driver. In reality the driver of the other car was neither drunk nor even at fault — police reports suggest that Mrs. Biden accidentally swerved into the lane of oncoming traffic. A horrible story — but not the story Joe Biden told for years. Mentally normal people do not do things like that. Honest people certainly do not do things like that. Imagine the cynicism and soul-deadness it takes to consider the death of your wife and child and then say to yourself “How could this situation be improved for political purposes?”
 Williamson then draws a parallel to Donald Trump: 
The obvious though less tragic parallel here is Donald Trump and his imaginary friend John Barron the character he invented to call up the New York gossip pages and lie about his sex life about all the famous beauties he was bedding. (Carla Bruni at one point was compelled to make a public statement after Trump claimed to be romantically linked to her: “Trump is obviously a lunatic.”) Again mentally normal people do not do things like that. And they surely don’t name their children after their imaginary friend press agents as Donald Trump did.
 I suppose not. But Biden’s lacks of decency makes Trump’s pale in comparison at least in these two episodes. We have replaced a lying scoundrel of a president with a lying scoundrel of a president. The difference? One in his present incarnation takes mostly conservatives positions; the other in his present incarnation takes almost exclusively left-liberal ones. Congratulations America. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
