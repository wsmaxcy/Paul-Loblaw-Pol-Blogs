L, Fight the Foo!, annieliforfactory for Conspiracy Theory Machines, 2021-06-29, The First World problems of UFO sightings. The future of an illusion or illusion of a future may be available from UFO sightings or in disinformation claims and cultural hegemony. Or maybe the pods speak English. Worth remembering today that the Trump Administration has released more credible evidence this year about the existence of UFOs than it has mustered about election or voter fraud so far. https://t.co/tk6MC0qwGC  Then again the miraculous like the Huei Tlamahuiçoltica appears for some cultures often on the sides of buildings in toast and on tree bark because Tinkerbell and wish-fulfillment but less so now that we have smart phones with cameras.  Null hypothesis rejected.Alternative hypothesis: the West is techno-nutty.  Aliens do not abduct AAPIs. Or is it that white folks like to be probed. There is a paper already on UFO abductions and Asian Americans in the Journal of Popular Culture. It is a fun read. UFOs like blond white people. https://t.co/3FA0pHSMXo  Many men smoke but Fu Manchu.  https://t.co/v6Bu44OB6L The artificial intelligence can then correlate data such as whether UFOs appear during political or military events weather satellite information or natural phenomena to better determine possible origins of the unidentified objects. The only time when China has officially confirmed a UFO sighting was in 1998 when two military jets had to intercept a low-flying object that looked like a “short-legged mushroom” with two beams of lights from its centre; when approached the object increased speed until it reached over 20000 metres before disappearing in a “ghostlike” manner. While China is investigating possible extra-terrestrial crafts the United States is also set to release a report into its own examination of strange objects spotted by Navy pilots. Nasa’s chief administrator Bill Nelson has said that the space agency is looking into videos released by the US Department of Defense which showed pilots attempting to track a rapidly speeding object across the water.  www.independent.co.uk/...

I was thinking it might be sci fi related but I dont think it is. Demographic of sci fi lovers : N USA = 42.8% australia new zealand = 28.4% west europe 18.2% east europe = 3.1% https://t.co/DU37EcTd6G  Both Siegel and Mainwaring were satisfied with the film as shot. It was originally meant to end with Miles screaming as truckloads of pods pass him by.[11] The studio wary of a pessimistic conclusion insisted on adding a prologue and epilogue suggesting a more optimistic outcome to the story which is thus told mainly in flashback. In this version the film begins with a ranting Bennell in custody in a hospital emergency ward. He then tells a consulting psychiatrist (Whit Bissell) his story. In the closing scene pods are found at a highway accident confirming his warning. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is notified.[2] en.wikipedia.org/...
