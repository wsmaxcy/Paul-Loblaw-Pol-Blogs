As always the diarist gets to sleep in and may show up long after the post is published. So you know it's a feature not a bug. Pull up a chair get your cup of tea coffee or other favorite morning beverage and join us for a neighborly start to the day ahead. Some things are too good not to share. This is two members of a five-member Nashville based group called ‘Wabash.’  “Take It With Me” was recorded in an empty grain silo. Brandon McDuffee doing the vocal and Quinn Bible on the guitar. Some time after this was recorded the band reconstituted itself as ‘Orlinda’ and continued performing until 2019.  From their web page they made this sad announcement “...(on Wednesday evening June 16 2019) Brandon McDuffee left this earth to embark on a new journey.  He was our leader easily the most talented member of our band and the best representation of a truly good hearted soul we know.  His music wisdom and friendship resonated with everyone that experienced it and may it continue to resonate within this universe.” Turn your speakers up and headphones are even better. Brandon does a great job from inside a grain silo with remarkable acoustics. You will not be able to listen to this just once.  There are a number of recordings made in grain silos. Some are forgettable while others are great.  A simple search for silo music on YouTube may turn up a jewel among the thorns. Wednesday Lagniappe: Seeing that it is Blues Wednesday we can be sure Justin Johnson has a great new release.   This is his latest posted last Monday.  He says “The sun is out and I can't help but pull this Gretsch Honey Dipper resonator out hit the back porch and play some toe-tappin' summertime blues.”  This is an open thread. We have stories tall tales weather reports critter reports music and companionship.  Get your favorite breakfast beverage and join us.
