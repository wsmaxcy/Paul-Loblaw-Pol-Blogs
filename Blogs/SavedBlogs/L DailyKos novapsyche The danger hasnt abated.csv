L, The danger hasn't abated, novapsyche, 2021-05-04, The events this past weekend concerning the Republican Party seem to have disturbed some folks.  The brouhaha with Liz Cheney so far this week has taken center stage but the fact that Mitt Romney got loudly and soundly booed by his own state delegates this weekend at a Republican conference that even some seasoned talking heads found themselves with whiplash.  The rabid Republican responses to the moderate voices in their party have with good cause spooked many in the commentariat.  Accordingly many anchors and columnists are examining what could have happened or may have been revealed between the end of the newsday on Friday and the start of Monday morning.  Cheney amplified her criticism of former president Trump since the weekend so much so that she is correctly the center of attention in the American political world.  In fact I expect the current saga involving her to last at least through the rest of this week’s newscycle.  She appears to have made the critical calculation that she may need to sacrifice her political life not just for the viability of the Republican Party going forward but also perhaps for the very sustainability of American democracy itself.  She deserves credit for demonstrating integrity.  As Cheney points out that members of today’s Republican Party enthralled even now continue to perpetuate Trump’s Big Lie by their very reticence the danger posed by the Big Lie hovers.  It’s my estimation that the Big Lie has expanded to have three central columns:  supposed massive yet undetectable voter fraud ambivalence of who is responsible for January 6th and why and utter miscarriage of justice in the Derek Chauvin trial.  The third thread may seem to be not as important as the previous two but all three have an underlying theme of sorts:  deference to authority.  (The sacking of the Capitol can be read in two ways depending on which bit of propaganda one prefers— either the marauders were leftists and should have respected the righteous authority of the U.S. government or they were patriotic rightists whose own authority should have been recognized by senators and members of Congress.)  For Cheney her mission is to keep all of us aware that Trumpism is an evil seed and that anything that flows from the belief of a stolen election will all be poisoned fruit.  For me however my main focus is how that new canon of ideas will be twisted to bend the electorate to the Republicans’ will.  The potential for abuse is massive.  Psychologically speaking once a person swallows a delusion they will do what they can to maintain that delusion especially if that idea becomes central to the person’s idea of self.  Make no mistake that Trump followers have internalized this trio of ideas and may indeed lash out in violence if their newly absorbed worldview is threatened.  I began this entry because last night Thomas Friedman—not normally one of my favorite opinionists—said on Anderson Cooper’s 9:00 p.m. show that the emergence of this hardline party canonization of lies has occurred in just the last few weeks.  Another analyst Denver Riggleman stated that the GOP’s reason for going so viciously after Liz Cheney might be internal polling (also he said the GOP only governs by polling so that is simultaneously interesting and frightening).  To me all of this indicates that there is almost certainly a small band of people at the nucleus of this effort determined to bring about this establishment of deceit.    Because all of this the question:  why is this core belief being perpetuated and reinforced now?  Is it mere coincidence as the recount in Maricopa County and various other places resume that the results of the previous election go back to being up for debate?  Moreover one must wonder how else could this core belief be manipulated to elicit a reaction in those who harbor it.  This trio of ideas is potentially a weapon in the wrong hands.  And there are many wrong hands here.
