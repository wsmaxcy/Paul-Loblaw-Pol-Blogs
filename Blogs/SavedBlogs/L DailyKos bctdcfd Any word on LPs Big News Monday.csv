L, Any word on LP's "Big News Monday"?, bctdcfd, 2021-05-04, There was at least one diary on DK after the search of Giuliani’s office touting that not only had the Lincoln Project folks predicted that “something” presumably the search had been going to happen that day but that they were also saying that Monday (yesterday) was going to be a big news day also. So did anything happen in relation to their prediction? Did I miss something?
