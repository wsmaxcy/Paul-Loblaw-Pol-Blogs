The Azure kingfisherEveryone loves a rebel! 🐦💙 pic.twitter.com/2HEonQnK1i  Kingfishers are some of my favorite birds. The Azure Kingfisher is a blue and orange bird always found near rivers lakes ponds swamps dams and other watery areas. This bird has distinctive orange underpants and vibrant violet sheened feathers on its head and back:  Small bright blue and deep orange kingfisher. Almost always found above water. It patrols up and down waterways and rivers from perch to perch flying very fast and only a few meters off the water typically making a loud high pitched "seeeeeeeep" call. Sacred Kingfisher has similar orange-buff belly but it is a much larger bird.  Had another lovely day in Swan Hill today and much thanks to this little fella and his mate who came to say hello in the morning.#AzureKingfisher#LumixG9 #WildOz pic.twitter.com/up9QLHdSBP .

The head neck upper parts and breast sides are deep azure blue with a violet (purplish) sheen. The neck has a distinctive orange stripe on each side and there is a small orange spot before each eye. The throat is pale orange-white grading to orange-reddish on belly and undertail. The flanks and sides of the breast are washed purple to violet. The legs and feet are red. The sexes are similar.

A post shared by @planetbirds (@planetbirds)  Mating nesting and breeding behaviors:  Azure Kingfishers form monogamous pairs that defend a breeding territory. Both parents incubate and feed the chicks. The nest is at the end of a burrow dug out of soil in a riverbank. The tunnel slopes upwards to the nesting chamber and can be 80 cm - 130 cm long. Flooding can destroy low-lying burrows.
