C, Caitlyn for Governor?, John Hinderaker, 2021-04-06, Caitlyn Jenner reportedly is considering a run for Governor of California: Scoop: Caitlyn Jenner is talking with political consultants as she actively explores a run for governor of California three sources with direct knowledge of her deliberations tell me & @jonathanvswan https://t.co/NWV4lD9Wp1 — Alayna Treene (@alaynatreene) April 6 2021  
From the Axios story: Jenner is being assisted in her consideration by Caroline Wren a longtime GOP fundraiser. Wren initially met Jenner through her work with the American Unity Fund a GOP nonprofit focused on LGBT issues. Wren previously worked at Trump Victory a joint fundraising committee for President Trump’s 2020 campaign and also helped organize the rally he addressed immediately before the U.S. Capitol assault on Jan. 6. The context of course is the upcoming (I think) recall of Governor Gavin Newsom. As I understand it the recall ballot will have two questions. The first is should Governor Newsom be recalled? If “Yes” wins the second question is who should replace him? I don’t believe there is any limit to the number of people who can pay a few thousand dollars and get on the ballot. If that is correct it places a premium on 1) celebrity and 2) niche appeal. That is how Arnold Schwarzenegger became Governor of California: he got the most votes when Gray Davis was recalled. Given that format Caitlyn Jenner may have a real chance of being the next governor. One of my daughters comments “If the first transgender governor is a Republican people will lose their minds.” A spectacle worth seeing. And finally: If Gavin Newson does not step down immediately to make way for California's first trans governor he is literally committing violence. https://t.co/bMesZPWpWM — Stephen L.
