L, DK Quilt Guild: Carpenter's Star: A Work In Progress, art ah zenforDK Quilt Guild, 2021-05-09, I watched a video from Jordan’s Fabrics and got this pattern free from her website.  I have been waiting until other quilts were finished to move on and the time has come!  I wanted to do it in batiks but did not find the assortment that I wanted and ended up buy these lovely fabrics in the flatfold section of M&L’s Fabrics for $3.49 a yard.  I had a gift card from before the lock down and all told I spent $7!  What a bargain! DK Quilt Guild is a place for quilters to gather share ideas projects and to make the world a better place one quilt at a time. Join us and share your thoughts projects questions and tips. Quilters here are at many different levels of skill. Beginners and non-quilters are welcome too. Would you like to write a future DK Quilt Guild diary?  We NEED writers! Your diary can be elaborate and full of photos a simple story of your own quilting history or that of someone you love a discussion of a current project or a technique you're learning new adventures... You could post quilt retreat-day recipes (things like crockpot meals so food appears without much attention from you)... We could do show and tell or open thread also but either way we need diarists to host. It is EASY if you're willing to take the chance. Please join in! Please volunteer within the comments or you can send Pam from Calif a kosmail. When I first tried to learn to quilt in the 80’s I bought a book called “It’s Okay If You Sit On my Quilt” by Mary Ellen Hopkins.  My copy is dated 1982.  The big take away for me was that you could break down a lot of traditional quilt patterns to small blocks of half square triangles (HST) and plot them out on a graph.  Also that you can speed cut a lot of things with little tricks.  The one I learned by heart was how to make HST’s 8 at a time and more if needed.  That came in handy when I started making this Carpenter’s Star pattern because it has beaucoup of them and the pattern calls for them to be made 2 at a time!  Because each color combo called for 4 8 or 16 of each I made 8 at a time and 4 at a time.  It saved me time and they are much more accurate than if I had cut all those squares. The other change I made is that the finished quilt was 72x86 and I wanted it smaller.  The pattern is (4) blocks all the same turned to form the star.  The blocks are made of 6 ¼ in HST’s making them 36x43 each.  I cut it down to 3 ½ in making the blocks 18 sq. The center is now 35 ½ in sq.  You can make (8) 3 ½ in HST’s with (2) 9 in squares and (4) with (2) 9x4 ½ in squares. I bought fabric for the full size quilt top so I have enough to make this diamond border shown above the block.  I think I will sandwich it in between 2 white strips and then something else.  We’ll see how big it gets before I run out of fabric. I am pleased with how well this fit and how tight most of the points are.  It is better than work I have done in the past.  I hope to get to the borders this week while I am playing nurse to my dog Razzle who had surgery last week on her left knee.  She is not a happy dog but not in pain due to drugs.  It won’t be too long until she is up and around like usual.  She had this same surgery on her right knee in 2018. Before I go here is the other children’s quilt I did last week. Tell us what you are up to.  I have blathered long enough.  Be safe and be well.
