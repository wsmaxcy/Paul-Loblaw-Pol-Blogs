L, Dan Crenshaw Trends On Twitter And Not In A Good Way, Frances Langum, 2021-03-22, Don't cross the streams Dan Crenshaw!  The Congressman from the Houston area and alleged insider trader went on Fox and trashed the Biden administration on their border policy which he described ON FOX NEWS as winking while claiming to discourage immigration.  Crenshaw claimed that Biden winks mean he won't deport people who cross the border illegally. That's a lie.  For which there was no pushback on Fox Propaganda Network obviously.  But Medhi Hassan on Peacock (and really he belongs on the actual NBC network get with it Comcast Suits) knows that 72% of those crossing the border in FEBRUARY were immediately deported.   Watch Crenshaw squirm when faced with actual facts.   CRENSHAW: “That sounds right sounds right but there’s also 20000 that are released family units that are released. HASAN: “Hold on. Hold on. Then it’s a lie to say there’s an open border as Republicans Kevin McCarthy your leader keep saying there’s an open border? That’s false. If 72% of people are being deported how is that an open border? That’s just a lie. CRENSHAW: “Look the vast majority of people are in these family units that do not get reported. There’s also at least 1000 a day —“ HASAN: “That’s not true. CRENSHAW: “I just got off the phone with Border Patrol. No listen to what I’m about to say. 1000 a day run away people who get away. Because here’s the thing you have to understand this too. When Border Patrol is dealing with hundreds and hundreds of family units at a time thee drug cartel says ‘You pay $300 a person you walk across there you turn yourself into Border Patrol and they’re going to just let you go.’ That’s exactly what happens. But here is what happens. Border Patrol becomes babysitters they become bus drivers they become nurses. You know what they’re not doing? Patrolling the border. Drug cartels love this. They can go around they get people through —“ HASAN: “I get your talking points about bus drivers babysiters —“ CRENSHAW: “They’re not talking points. These are facts. You should go down there. You need to go down there and see this for yourself. These are facts. HASAN: “I mean a CBP officer is not a babysitter. But let me just ask you this —“ CRENSHAW: “They’re being told to be. HASAN: “It cannot be an open border if 72% of people are removed. That’s just nonsensical to claim that. You know that. I know that. All of a sudden the immigration situation is complicated and has a history going back to 2014?  And we can both sides the issue faced by BOTH Obama and Trump?  As if Trump didn't separate children from their parents as a DETERRENT to border crossings even those legal border crossings from asylum seekers?  Whenever this issue comes up remember:  people who are seeking asylum from gang violence or political oppression who might be murdered if they remain in their home country are entering the United States LEGALLY.  Asylum laws command that the US hear their case and admit them if they are found to require asylum.  Asylum is a protection granted to foreign nationals already in the United States or arriving at the border who meet the international law definition of a “refugee. The United Nations 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol define a refugee as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country and cannot obtain protection in that country due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of being persecuted in the future “on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Congress incorporated this definition into U.S. immigration law in the Refugee Act of 1980. As a signatory to the 1967 Protocol and through U.S. immigration law the United States has legal obligations to provide protection to those who qualify as refugees. The Refugee Act established two paths to obtain refugee status—either from abroad as a resettled refugee or in the United States as an asylum seeker.  American media in general and of course Fox News in particular have no coverage of this fact.  Fox promotes anti-immigrant racism daily when a Democrat is in the White House. And Dan Crenshaw knows that what he's saying on Fox is pro-Republican propaganda.  He gets tangled in his own lies when he appears outside the Fox News bubble and then he gets trending on Twitter.  That's not a good thing Dan.  In case you missed it MSNBC’s Mehdi Hasan totally destroyed GQP Seditionist criminal insider trader Dan Crenshaw tonight and all it took was a couple of on point fact checks to make him crumble. Loved it. — Ricky Davila (@TheRickyDavila) March 22 2021 Mehdi Hasan debating Dan Crenshaw right now on the border issue is like watching Mike Tyson fight Urkel. — Jason Overstreet 🩸🦷🗽 (@JasonOverstreet) March 22 2021 Also remember when @PolitiFact rated your claims on asylum seekers as “false”?
