L, From Derek Chauvin to Central American Refugees, Ishteeb, 2021-04-25, It is time to take a close look at the training our police receive if we are to prevent thousands more  Derek Chauvins operating in our cities. American police departments have become increasingly militarized. Whatever happened to community policing and the beat cop? Now we have snipers armored vehicles and advanced weaponry. Our military adventures in the Middle East and Asia have created a population of security personnel who take what they learned there and bring it to police departments as if a wartime situation is directly applicable to an urban or suburban neighborhood. While North Americans are being subjected to this militarized policing Central Americans have been suffering under their repressive regimes supported by the same American militarized police training.  The civil wars in Central America are rooted in land disputes fomented by American fruit companies (United Fruit which is now Chiquita) backed by American military support.  So now we suffer the influx of desperate refugees who are trying to escape conditions created by Central American special police forces such as the Commando Six in Guatemala Tigres and Salvadoran death squads who were/are trained and supported by American military/police in conflict with insurgents and criminal gangs. From Wikipedia Guatemala: “It was at this phase in the conflict that the U.S. government sent Green Berets and CIA advisers to instruct the Guatemalan military in counterinsurgency (anti-guerrilla warfare). In addition U.S. police and "Public Safety" advisers were sent to reorganize the Guatemalan police forces.[69] In response to increased insurgent activity in the capital a specialty squad of the National Police was organized in June 1965 called Comando Seis ('Commando Six') to deal with urban guerilla assaults. 'Commando Six' received special training from the US Public Safety Program and money and weapons from US Public Safety Advisors.” Honduras: “The Comando de Operaciones Especiales COECO ("special operations command" or "Cobras") are an elite unit of Honduran police agents skilled in managing riots and disturbances sniper shooting and tactical and special operations. The unit trains with American SWAT units.[24]” On 26 July 2012 legislation was passed for the creation of the TIGRES "Intelligence Troop and Special Security Response Groups" or "Tigers". The TIGRES counters organized crime and hooliganism in conjunction with judges and public prosecutors. The TIGERS are trained for several months by instructors from the US Army Special Forces and members of the JUNGLAS unit of the Colombian National Police with the support of the US government.[25] El Salvador: “The United States contributed to the conflict by providing military aid of $1–2 million per day to the government of El Salvador during the Carter[30] and Reagan administrations and provided significant training. The Salvadoran government was considered "friendly" and an ally by the U.S. in the context of the Cold War.[31] By May 1983 US officers started to take over positions in the top levels of the Salvadoran military and were making critical decisions and running the war.[32]” ( All quotes from Wikipedia) What goes down comes around. The over militarization of society is what we should be rejecting if we are to reform our social systems. There may be a solution for our southern brothers and sisters as well.
