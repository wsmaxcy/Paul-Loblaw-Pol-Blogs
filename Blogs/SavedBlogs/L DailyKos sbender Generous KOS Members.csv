L, Generous KOS Members, sbender, 2021-04-18, The members of this group have been so supportive to me and to my students  When we are finally given the opportunity for face to face instruction on the fall it will have been 16 months since my students have been in a real classroom  My school is sponsoring a summer camp for the entire month of June to re-energize the students in our school community.  Please help with these projects if you are able.  Stay safe the world needs more caring dedicated people like you
