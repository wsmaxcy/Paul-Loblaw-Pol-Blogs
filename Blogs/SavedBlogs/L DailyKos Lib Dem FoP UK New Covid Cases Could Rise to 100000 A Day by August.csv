L, UK: New Covid Cases "Could Rise to 100000 A Day" by August, Lib Dem FoP, 2021-07-06, The UK is about to become a gigantic experiment. The government has decided to carry on with the lifting of all laws concerning COVID counter measures from July 19. Masks will only be required by law in medical environments. At the same time the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading fast with 28773 new cases on July 5. Many more infections can be expected with England playing a Euro soccer game in London. The government is gambling on the rate of vaccinations in over 18s and higher natural immunity among the young to avoid NHS facilities becoming overwhelmed. Around 86% of adults will by “freedom day” be protected by one dose of a vaccine 64% by two. (based on the reports for July 2 and 3 to allow immunities to develop) With the age-cohort rollout of the vaccines those with one dose are likely to be under 40. Those with serious co-morbidities or risk under 40 would have had two. Data shows that vaccines have broken the link between infection and serious illness and death. Given the probability that any infections will result in far less hospitalisations and deaths the government has listened to its advisors that the NHS would be safe. Other advisors beg to differ but the new Health Minister is an “open-upper”. UK health minister Sajid Javid said coronavirus cases could rise to 100000 per day after restrictions in England are lifted on 19 July. The UK recorded an average of 25447 new cases per day in the seven days up to 2 July.  Javid told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that thanks to the “huge wall of defence” provided by the covid-19 vaccination programme covid-19 deaths are currently only one-thirtieth of those the last time daily cases were around 25000 per day. Nevertheless Azra Ghani at Imperial College London said in a statement that “current trends in hospital admissions if extrapolated […] could put a severe strain on the NHS”. Other scientists such as Christina Pagel at University College London have expressed concerns about the risks of long covid. Javid also announced that people who are double-jabbed and under 18s will not have to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19 from 16 August. Self-isolation will be replaced by testing. The UK does around a million tests a day mostly lateral flow self-tests. Secondary school students do two a week. The amount of testing will pick up a lot of asymptomatic cases among the vaccinated. There will inevitably be an increase in deaths. In some any infection however mild can be life threatening. The one glaring fault so far is the absence of information about the changed set of most common symptoms. This is data from the ZOE COVID symptom tracking project with over a million participants. Those who have had the Delta variant are reporting headache runny nose and other cold-like symptoms. Few in the fully vaccinated got a fever. The government advice will in effect be “you’re on your own to decide”. Fortunately the British public seem to be fairly sensible as in a survey earlier this month 71% wanted compulsory mask wearing on public transport to continue.  If this sounds a lot like “let it rip through the unvaccinated so we reach herd immunity” it’s because that is exactly what it is.
