L, Marjorie Taylor Greene added to task force addressing religious freedom; Ilhan Omar calls B.S., Aldous J Pennyfarthing, 2021-06-29, Because I’m an American I support every citizen’s right to worship any supernatural entity they like. That includes Yahweh. Or Ba’al. Or Simone Biles. (And if there were video anywhere of L. Ron Hubbard doing this I might even consider a tip o’ the hat to Xenu the supreme overlord of the evil Galactic Confederacy.) Personally I don’t worship anyone. I just don’t have the time. Or inclination. And I can’t remember my confirmation name so I’m too embarrassed to go back to the Catholic Church. I’m pretty sure it was something with a “J.” Jeremiah? Jacob? Jinxy? Something like that. Plus the Catholic Church has some ‘splaining to do and I’m not holding my breath on that front. The point is I fervently believe that everyone should have a right to worship freely or to not worship at all. I choose the latter. Change my mind. Or don’t. Actually don’t. I know where all the embarrassing Bible verses are hidden. Don’t test me man. So it’s more than a bit odd that Gym Jordan’s task force on “defending foundational American freedoms” including freedom of worship is soliciting the quarter-baked opinions of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who not only thinks Jesus is the only way to heaven but also believes the Christian Bible is the only legitimate accessory for the swearing-in of members of Congress. (Because of the near ubiquity of Polaroid cameras and Sharpies at ‘80s dorm parties I know I’ll never be elected to Congress. But if I were forced to pick a book for oath-reciting purposes it would probably be Catch-22. Or something from Vonnegut.) Either way there’s nothing in the Constitution or anywhere else that proscribes the use of a Koran for government oath-taking but that didn’t stop MTG from asserting that there was. And Rep. Ilhan Omar noticed:  Marjorie Taylor Greene tried to force me and @RashidaTlaib to retake our oaths of office on the Christian Bible instead of the Quran she doesn’t believe in religious freedom or the constitution. This is who the GOP wants on the task force overseeing our “freedom to worship”?? https://t.co/k20CTMUXPo  For the nontweeters: Marjorie Taylor Greene tried to force me and @RashidaTlaib to retake our oaths of office on the Christian Bible instead of the Quran she doesn’t believe in religious freedom or the constitution. This is who the GOP wants on the task force overseeing our “freedom to worship”?? Omar is right about this of course. In 2019 before she was mysteriously elected to Congress Greene tried to force both Rep. Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib to retake their oaths on Christian Bibles asserting that it was the only legal way to do so. I know how shocking it is to hear that Greene was wrong about something but bear with me. Since we're doing old videos of Marjorie Taylor Greene harassing people here's her from before she was elected in Feb 2019 turning up in Congress to try & get @IlhanMN & @RashidaTlaib to retake their oaths on a Bible & not a Quran:(h/t @ehananoki)pic.twitter.com/YMr7InKYqZ  The UK’s Independent: What she was insinuating in that video was that there was some law that required all members of Congress to be sworn in on the Bible. At the time of Ms Omar and Ms Tlaib’s ceremonies Ms Greene claimed there was no law allowing them to use a Quran over the Bible. There has never been a law in United States history that requires an elected official of the country to take the oath of office with a Bible or any other religious text. The United States Constitution actually states "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.” So there you go. Of course if Republicans were really serious about protecting freedom of worship they’d find someone who understands the concept. Or who has the barest whiff of understanding. Clearly Greene doesn’t qualify. But hey this isn’t about religious freedom at all now is it? It’s about out-Jesusing the other side—even if the Jesus they imagine is not the same Jesus who told his followers to render unto Caesar or you know help the poor. By the way since Greene is so eager to wave her Bible around maybe she could take some time to read it once in a while. She might want to start with Leviticus 19:34: “You will regard the alien who resides with you as the native-born among you. You are to love him as yourself for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.” Oh sorry Marge. That conflicts with Ocher Fuckface 1:13: “In all things be an asshole as I have commanded you.” Yeah that sounds like it’s more her speed.  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter that is). What is it?
