L, Playing Hardball To Win in the States, SheryleR, 2021-06-28, The Republicans are stripping elections from the Electorate and giving them to the Legislature. This is completely disgraceful and wrong – don’t get me wrong. But it is also a huge danger to democratic government and we need to plan. Yes file lawsuits challenging this but don’t expect that the courts will step in. Technically what they’re doing isn’t against the law. I live in Virginia. I do not want the Legislature to draft laws as in Georgia Texas and Pennsylvania to take the election away from localities and move them to the Legislature if they feel like it. But a law in Virginia and all other Democratic States that required the State to remove one Republican-won election every time another state removed a Democratic-won election just makes sure that what they’re doing hurts. We can sit and say oh we want real voters. But that’s not the game they’re playing. They’re playing to be able to overthrow elections in 2022 and 2024. So a call to action: call for your state to write and pass a bill that removes Republican wins from your state every time a Republican state removes Democratic-wins from their states. And yes this is stupid. But they think that people in the Capitol on 6 January were tourists. They will believe anything. Make it hurt.
