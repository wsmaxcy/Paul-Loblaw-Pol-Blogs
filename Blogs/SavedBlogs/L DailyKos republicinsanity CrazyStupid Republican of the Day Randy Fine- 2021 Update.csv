L, Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day: Randy Fine- 2021 Update, republicinsanity, 2021-05-08, On this date one year ago “Crazy/Stupid Republican of the Day” first profiled Randy Fine a member of the Florida House of Representatives from District 53 who was first elected back in 2016 and a second term with 55% in 2018. He did so with the campaign strategy of attacking his Democratic opponent Phil Moore by accusing him of thinking he was “above the law” and giving the shocking examples of… traffic citations. In his time in office Fine has decided to call for a city to be dissolved due to them not being able to afford to build a highway on their city budget and called for the University of Central Florida to be shut down in 2019 because of “excessive spending” he didn’t like (Heaven forbid money be spent on education).But Randy Fine really got onto our radar back in November of 2017 after an insane social media outburst. You see Fine is the only Jewish member of the Florida GOP. And when his own constituents began asking him why he was sponsoring bills that would forbid businesses and municipalities to do business with ”anti-Semitic” companies. What that definition includes is any business that Fine gets annoyed with for not blindly supporting Israel. But his constituents weren’t even AGAINST the idea… they were just wanting to know how it would work and were asking their representative online… Fine doesn’t deal well with being questioned though and anyone who wanted details he would quickly declare was also “Anti-Semitic” or straight up a “NAZI”. One such “Nazi” was a disabled veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces.That wasn’t a one-off and Fine didn’t learn anything as evidenced how in April of 2019 he got into another online argument and was attacking a constituent in a similar manner. Once he learned the person he was calling an “anti-Semite” was Jewish though Fine instead referred to his 68 year old opposition as a “Judenrat” a term for a Nazi-installed council made of Jewish members during World War II. When confronted with the fact that doing so is just y’know f***ed up Fine doubled down and insisted he was using the term properly.In spite of Randy Fine’s obvious mental instability he won re-election in November with 55% of the vote. That has allowed him to continue to sponsor and vote for some of the most brazenly bigoted bills in the Florida including HB 1 the biggest direct attack on First Amendment rights Florida has put forth in decades that changed the legal definition of “riot” to reflect protesters and then removed civil liability for anyone who might run over a “rioter”. If that scenario sounds familiar Randy Fine submitted legislation that would protect the sort of Neo-Nazi motherf***er that ran over a crowd of people in Charlottesville and killed Heather Heyer.If you’re not revolted by Randy Fine yet (and you should be) he was also a sponsor of Florida’s HB 1475 the transphobic bill aimed at targeting transgender youth who participate in public school athletics and have created a conservative “smaller government” philosophy of children being forced to submit to mandatory genital inspections to prove they’re the sex of their birth.This is Randy Fine and his surname is ironic because none of this s*** is okay.Click Here for Full CSGOPOTD ArchiveOne Year Ago May 8th 2020: Randy Fine (FL)… Original ProfileTwo Years Ago May 8th 2019: Phil Covarrubias (CO)… 2019 UpdateThree Years Ago May 8th 2018: Phil Covarrubias (CO)… Original ProfileFour Years Ago May 8th 2017: Mike Fair (SC)Five Years Ago May 8th 2016: Karen Davis (CA)Six Years Ago May 8th 2015: Glenn McConnell (SC)
