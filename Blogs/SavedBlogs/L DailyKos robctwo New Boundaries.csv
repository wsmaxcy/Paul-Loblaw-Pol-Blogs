L, New Boundaries, robctwo, 2021-05-09, I am fully vaccinated and going out in public for the first time in 13+ months. I expect to run into more tRumpites. I have a plan. I am wearing a Joe Biden hat. “I am with the Democrats and am here to help. If you have any problems let me know I will contact our Senators and Representative and let them know what you need.” My expectation is that all will go well and we will come together to solve all society’s ills over the next few weeks. Or not. If I encounter any hostility I am filming. Right now. I am telling my phone where I am and what the problem is. The problem should be able to hear me. I am not going anywhere. I will tell the problem to stay away from me. I like 21’ in a public place. If I feel threatened I am calling 911. I do not want a cop. I want a mental health professional. 911 what’s your emergency I am being threatened by a delusional person we need a mental health intervention. 911 what is the delusion I don’t know for sure something about needing to kill me because of election fraud 911 are they still a threat right now? Can’t you hear them screaming at me? 911 what are you doing to antagonize them? I am standing here calling you with my phone on video help. I am not sure if I will need to use this but I am convinced the way to deal with delusional people at all levels is to put them into the mental health care environment. For everyone’s safety. The defense bar is already starting to use the mental health crisis as a reason to escape criminal liability for the 1/6/21 Insurrection. There is going to be a pre-trial hearing on the admissibility of the “Foxitis/Foxdelusional propaganda made me do it” defense. In Federal Court. I wonder if the defense lawyer is going to be allowed to call Hanity/Carlson/Ingram in person or if the court will only allow videos? If there is any hesitation by anyone in law enforcement/mental health to respond appropriately the next step is to get their ID and send a letter to their supervisor. You might not be able/willing to do what I am going to do. I am 70. Born and raised in Corvallis Oregon. 40+ years lawyering. I will not tolerate tRumpites bothering me in public any more than I will tolerate any other psychopath ranting delusions and threatening me and my society with violence. I have a lot of experience dealing with psychotic people. Psychosis: A mental disorder characterized by disconnection from reality which results in strange behavior often accompanied by perception of stimuli (voices images sensations) and other hallucinations. (emphasis mine) I am unwilling to cede society to people who are delusional. I don’t care if there are millions of them. They threaten me my family and my way of life just by being allowed out in public spouting delusions. This is something we can all do every day. It is no longer about opinions about politics it is now about whether some people get to choose a reality when it is not objectively real and live their lives based on that delusion to our peril. If you are disconnected from reality you need mental health help. I have sat in numerous involuntary commitment hearings in Benton County. There is a whole system set up to evaluate delusional people. “I believe in tRump” is no excuse to avoid a mental health exam. Almost all of my psychotic clients had deeply held beliefs about all things political. They were delusions not based in reality. You see how this fits? Early on in the Covid crisis when I could not see my 92 year old mother in a retirement home my 75 year old tRumpite neighbor started in on “the hoax”. I told her I was going to advise her family to seek a mental health exam and consider removing her checking and driving abilities. She got it. I am not joking. One of my fishing friends called me last May about our plans for last summer. The tRump wasteland of 2020. I told her it didn’t look good due to incompetence in testing thanks to tRump. She is a retired social worker with a MS. She asked me if I had heard about the problem with the children. I was a bit confused so we talked. She told me about a plot to kidnap children involving the children’s services in Oregon. I asked her if she still went to church with the Sheriff. She said she did. I told her to call him and report what she knew. Even though she is retired as am I we have a continuing moral obligation at least to report child abuse. She was silent for a bit. I told her she was delusional. I told her if she called they would put her on a watch list for dementia. I told her the neighbors were going to watch for inappropriate behaviors. I am not joking. I have started fishing for the summer. My group is all vaccinated. Some have health issues or live with fragile people. I am staying with my daughter’s family two nights per week with a 5 & 7 yr old. I have decided to wear a mask on my boat to protect others until the rates get way down. I am letting everyone decide to mask or not. We have the close outdoors environment on all boats. I have decided if you are not two weeks post-vaccine and are not willing to wear a mask if I ask you to I will not spend a minute of my time with you. I was not surprised to see a 1776 shirt on the 25 year old high school grad living with his parents big truck AR15 grand-nephew the other day. We had a short talk. “Your grandfather way back on my paternal side came to America in 1745. His children killed the English to form this Country. We have always defended democracy. We are ashamed of you all of us. You are also delusional and it will not work out well for you.” I invited him to call me anytime to get re-oriented. I told him I would spend no time with him while he was un-American. He has not called. I have a test for anyone who wants to spend recreation time around me. Who won the 2020 Presidential election was the election fair show your sources. if you do not have the reality based answer you are delusional dangerous and in need of some serious mental health treatment. I expect to see some real world results. I’ll keep you posted.
