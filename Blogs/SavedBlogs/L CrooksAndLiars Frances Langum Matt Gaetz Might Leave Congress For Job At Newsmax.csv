L, Matt Gaetz Might Leave Congress For Job At Newsmax, Frances Langum, 03-30-21, Wait what?   I guess if trolling is your only marketable skill then moving from Republican Congressman to Newsmax on-air "talent" is a step up. Matt Gaetz is apparently floating the "news" that he will be leaving Congress to join the team at Newsmax.  Axios reports "Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has privately told confidants he's seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax three sources with direct knowledge of the talks tell Axios." Twitter was quick to respond:  All we had to do to get rid of Matt Gaetz was offer him a job at Newsmax? pic.twitter.com/V0TtCK3paM — Voters of Tomorrow (@VotersTomorrow) March 30 2021 Quitting Congress early might be the first time @mattgaetz has done anything that will directly benefit his constituents. — Steve Is Damaged (@SteveIsDamaged) March 30 2021 Not surprised. Congressman Matt Gaetz has passed zero pieces of legislation beyond naming a post office after someone.He's not a legislator. He's a lying performance artist so of course he'll fit in at Newsmax. And he'll get paid well as they try to become the new Fox News. pic.twitter.com/fb0jgpLWL2 — Russell Drew (@RussOnPolitics) March 30 2021 Is this his attempt at a gracious exit before the FBI tie him into the Jan6 debacle? — Clint Graves (@EaglePursuit) March 30 2021 There are likely "other" things motivating @mattgaetz. The fear of indictment for instance once AG Merrick Garland begins pulling threads on the GOP Corruption that brought us the insurrection. The threads go all the way back to Russia - as Matt knows all too well. — A L Katz (@ImALKatz) March 30 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
