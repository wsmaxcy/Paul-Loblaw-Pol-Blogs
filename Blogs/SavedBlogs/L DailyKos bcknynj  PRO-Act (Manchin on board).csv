L, PRO-Act (Manchin on board), bcknynj , 2021-04-19, Manchin now on board.  That leaves: Kelly Sinema and Warner.  PRO-ACT (Protecting the Right to Organize). Fox headline was: Manchin to cosponsor PRO Act union-backed bill that would crush right-to-work laws.  www.foxnews.com/… The problem remains the filibuster as there’s no plausible interpretation that would allow labor/union law to be added to reconciliation bill. Another example of why it’s impossible to pigeon hole Manchin.  He has his own set of beliefs.
