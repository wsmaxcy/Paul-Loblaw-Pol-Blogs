He shoots the elephant four times without killing it and the creature is audibly in pain before it is finally killed by their guide. “The Secret Footage of the N.R.A. Chief’s Botched Elephant Hunt”: It shows that when guides tracked down an elephant for LaPierre the N.R.A. chief proved to be a poor marksman. After LaPierre’s first shot wounded the elephant guides brought him a short distance from the animal which was lying on its side immobilized. Firing from point-blank range LaPierre shot the animal three times in the wrong place. Finally a guide had the host of “Under Wild Skies” fire the shot that killed the elephant. Later that day Susan LaPierre showed herself to be a better shot than her husband. After guides tracked down an elephant for her Susan killed it cut off its tail and held it in the air. “Victory!” she shouted laughing. “That’s my elephant tail. Way cool.” The video of the LaPierres’ sport hunt is linked in the article.

Cowardly mass shootings merchant Wayne LaPierre and his wife gunning down these beautiful animals and for what? Their sick sadistic version of ‘fun’? Really makes you question which creatures in this world are the actual beasts” tweeted Joy Reid host of The Reid Out. From the article: To avoid bad publicity—and at Susan’s written request—body parts from both elephants were shipped to the U.S. in a hidden manner. The elephants’ front feet were made “into stools for Wayne and Susan’s home.” They are truly despicable people.
