L, Appears There Is No "Trump Stain" For Some Lawyers Who Worked For Trump at least for now., Merlin196357, 2021-04-25, No I am not talking about so called lawyers like Rudy Giuliani or Sidney Powell.  Seems a number of lawyers who were using Trump as a means to a corporate/legal end were welcomed back with open arms to one Mecca of Republican Law Firms:  Jones Day of Cleveland OH.  Jones Day is where Don McGhan was working before he jumped onto the Trump train.  Jones Day has welcomed back a slew of lawyers from the Trump administration since the start of the year sealing the Midwestern firm’s reputation as a central player in Republican party politics.The return of Jones Day partners began in earnest in April 2019 when Don McGahn came back to the 2500-lawyer firm based in Cleveland Ohio after serving as Donald Trump’s first White House counsel. Between January and March of this year Jones Day welcomed back at least seven more lawyers from the White House and federal agencies such as the Department of Justice according to announcements by the firm. Eighteen Jones Day lawyers worked for the Trump administration according to ProPublica.  Some of the returning lawyers were given higher positions than they had before at Jones Day underscoring the ties between the Trump movement and the firm lawyers and recruiters said. They included McGahn who now heads its government regulation group and Noel Francisco the former US solicitor general who leads the firm’s Washington office. Emphasis is mine. Not only were some of them hired back they got promoted!   And what did Jones Day get out of Trump?  They got at least $25 million dollars in fees from Trump and Republican organizations since 2015.  And considering McGahn is a Federalist Society mofo the other thing Jones Day got was a judiciary filled with Republican extremists who think they can channel the Founding Fathers “original intent” into the 21st Century. That $25 million sounds like a lot but Jones Day didn’t become the fifth largest law firm with only Trump as a client.  They have represented such stalwarts as the “National Rifles Association Proctor and Gamble RJ Reynolds McDonald’s Chevron and Goldman Sachs.”  Jones Day took in $2 billion dollars in revenue in 2018.   And did Jones Day have to sorta kind help Trump with the 2020 Election?  They represented the Pennsylvania Republican Party with their jihad against mail-in-ballots.  But Jones Day claims they didn’t help Trump with any of his failed “voter fraud” lawsuits. I guess they do not want to sully their winning image with loser lawsuits. There are lots of lovely information in this article about other legal matters Jones Day was involved with but I think you get the gist.  The bottom line is that Jones Day lawyers got tax cuts for their corporate clients judges who will rule against consumers workers taxpayers and the environment for decades to come and have helped further cement Republican Party power.  And they got bigger salaries to boot! Who says that everything Trump touches dies?
