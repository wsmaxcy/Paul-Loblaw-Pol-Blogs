L, Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction (or I Can’t Wait to See This Movie!), Garrits123, 2021-05-10, No one could have possibly foreseen America’s current predicament. A Russian asset in the Oval Office for four years is bad enough but if you add a pandemic with a sky high death rate one of two political parties consistently  feeding whopper-sized lies to the public resulting in an insurrection  and a shaky economy it’s enough to make you want to just go to bed and pull the covers over your head before anything else can go wrong.   So how do we fix it? First America needs to recognize what Trump & republicans are trying to so bizarrely accomplish. In order to do that we must first acknowledge that Trump was “elected” with substantial help from Putin and he is therefore a Russian asset. In fact former CIA Director John Brennan has publicly referred to Trump as a Russian asset multiple times. What we just witnessed during Trump’s presidency was a never before seen destruction of our government aided and abetted by republicans in Congress. It wasn’t just because Trump is ignorant or because he’s a walking crime scene. Although some of his destruction can be attributed to both of those things there was also a method to his madness and some of it was likely being directed by Trump’s mentor in how to be a despot Vlad Putin.  We know Russian operatives infiltrated the NRA. My guess is they’ve also infiltrated evangelical groups and white supremacy organizations years ago in order to encourage division anger & violence. Their job is to continually stir the pot of anger. In addition these operatives are on all social media platforms attempting to radicalize and con ordinary people into believing things about our government that simply aren’t true. That’s the kind of activity that can destabilize nations. Putin knows that and his fondest wish is to destabilize America & NATO. (western Europe) When the middle class America’s largest socio-economic sector finds their discretionary spending seriously diminished wages still sluggish and the wage gap between the haves and the have-nots widening there will very likely be civil unrest. If you add a pandemic forcing businesses to shut down and a skyrocketing death toll that’s a recipe for disaster. Through his willing accomplices Trump & republicans Putin is destabilizing the wealthiest most powerful nation in the world. But that’s not all. At the same time that we have a Russian asset in the presidency we also have one of our two political parties the GOP working to create civil unrest for its own purposes. Here’s how it happened: Decades ago a few wealthy republican/libertarians  came up with a long-term plan to fundamentally change America in every way. They first aligned the GOP more solidly with corporate interests the 1% and Russia. That was to supply the money they needed to implement their plan. Then they began engaging in activities with what were then considered outlier & extremist groups and helped them get political traction they never had before. They did that to get their votes. These were mainly the NRA evangelicals & white supremacists. The GOP then brought them together as a political party. (See the book ‘Democracy In Chains’ by Nancy MacLean) Those alliances are driving the GOP’s refusal to pass gun control laws the push to make abortion illegal & to end same sex marriage. Those issues also have the extra added attraction of providing emotional flashpoints that further their objective of pitting Americans against each other to destabilize us as a nation. The point of destabilizing us dovetails with their plan to write a new Constitution. (See the WaPo article ‘The biggest Threat to Democracy that Nobody is talking About’ by Jonathan Capeheart Sept. 4 2018.) At the heart of the republican plan to destroy America as we know it is the libertarian philosophy that if you can’t afford something you can’t have it. For example the wealthy libertarians behind it (Kochs Mercers DeVos Bannon etc.) believe all education should be private. In other words they don’t want to pay taxes to support public education. Hence we had Betsy DeVos as Sec. of Education slowly  and systematically defunding public education. Nor do they want their tax dollars to be used to subsidize healthcare medicare medicaid welfare SNAP (early childhood meal supplements) or any other social safety net. Libertarianism is at the heart of the attempts to discontinue or privatize social security and all of the other social safety net programs. It’s why funding for Head Start programs dried up and it was behind the Trump administration’s efforts to deregulate and disregard EPA standards to allow drilling offshore and in National Parks. The people behind this government takeover want 100% un-fettered capitalism freedom to pollute at will and as far as I can tell a two-tier society composed of the haves and the have-nots. The flaw in their scheme is that if they are successful at severely reducing the buying power of the middle class (and that’s the trajectory we’ve been on) we won’t be able to afford what corporations are selling. That’s a big problem because a prosperous middle class is what propelled corporations to achieve great fortunes & made America the wealthiest nation in the world. Corporations are just beginning to understand this and put the brakes on the GOP’s single-minded  attempts to impoverish the middle class. The bottom line is a prosperous middle class is necessary to a healthy economy.  All of these manipulations and machinations by republican/ libertarians are being funded by wealthy libertarians as well as the Russian mob. If you look at the amount of money being spent to fund republicans’ campaigns you’ll see that it sharply escalated eighteen months to a year prior to Trump’s alleged victory in 2015-16. For example campaign donations to Mitch McConnell escalated into the millions from Russian oligarchs alone. (See “How Putin's oligarchs funneled millions into GOP campaigns” Dallas Morning News by Ruth May 5/8/18.) Putin’s game plan is as old as the hills. It’s called divide and conquer. It’s the same game libertarians are playing they just aren’t as obvious. Or maybe they are. At any rate if Trump is re-elected he will create more massive instability to further Putin’s and Libertarians’ causes. At the heart of all of these activities both domestic & foreign is money enormous amounts of money. Money that has been flooding individual republican coffers. We all know there are plenty of people who will do anything for money. Several of them are Congressmen & women. When the CitizensUnited decision opened the floodgates for money is when we started losing control of our country. So as you may have guessed the single most important thing to do is stop the flow of money corrupting our government. One obvious way to do that is to make all private campaign donations illegal and allow only public money to be used for campaigning. Public money is used to pay the salaries of all government employees why not use it for campaigns? Every candidate should receive the same amount of public money. The FEC should collect receipts for campaign expenditures to make sure they match the amounts spent. When the public money has been spent that’s it. There is no more money. I realize it’s more complicated than that but I’m certain it can all be worked out. The problem is having enough people in Congress to vote for a campaign funding scheme using only public money.  Frankly it’s astonishing how well America is doing considering all of the above. But make no mistake. We are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination. Not long ago I composed a tweet saying these difficulties will pass. Someone tweeted back asking me how I knew that and my response was I know it because I’ve studied history. What we’re experiencing is a cultural aberration you could even call it a fad but that implies an inappropriate superficiality & this is anything but superficial. If you know anything about quantum entanglement (what Einstein called “Spooky action at a distance”) you know we are all connected. That connection is why we are seeing a worldwide resurgence of authoritarianism.  Here’s the thing it WILL pass but we do have a choice. We can allow ourselves and our country to sink to the same level of depravity as Hitler’s Germany or we can resist with all our might. Then one day we can watch a fascinating movie telling the story of how we did it.
