L, Turns Out Caitlyn Jenner Lied About Not Voting In 2020!, Susie Madrak, 2021-05-11, UPDATE: Turns out Caitlyn Jenner was lying about not voting! Which seems to indicate she did not vote for Trump. From Politico: Caitlyn Jenner told CNN this week that she never voted for president in the November 2020 election. But Los Angeles County records show she actually did cast a ballot last fall. https://t.co/tIwAM0neGl — POLITICO (@politico) May 12 2021 Donald Trump proved you don't have to be experienced or competent to be president. All you need is a media personality right? So other incompetent people like frontrunner Caitlyn Jenner look at Trump and think "Why not me?" Dana Bash interviewed her this morning on CNN. "I need to surround myself with good people and I'm very fortunate that the Republican party has supported me in a way that they've surrounded me with really good people" Jenner said. "You haven't talked to Trump at all about any of this?" "No." Asked if she voted for him in 2020 she responded "I didn't even vote." "Out here in California it's like why vote for a Republican president? It's just not going to work. It's overwhelming. and at the time -- " "Did you vote down ticket?" "No. It was voting day and I thought the only thing out here in California that I worry about which affects people is the propositions that were out there. And I didn't see any propositions that I really had one side or the other. And so it was Election Day and I just couldn't get excited about it. And I just wound up going to play golf and I said 'Ehh I'm not doing that.' " "So how do you get people excited to vote for you now that you want to be on the ballot?" "Because I'm cute and adorable?" she said. California Democrats please don't forget to vote. Keep this bubblebrain away from the governor's seat. And there's this reminder of who she is.
