C, VIP Live On Tuesday, John Hinderaker, 2021-03-28, We haven’t done a VIP Live show for a while. Maybe we were stunned into silence by the election I don’t know. In any event we are back or will be as of 7 p.m. Central (5 Pacific 8 Eastern) on Tuesday. We will kick around the issues of the day as well as taking questions and comments from VIPs. If you are a VIP member you will get an email with a link to a live address where you can watch the event and submit comments and questions.  If you are not already a VIP member you can become one by clicking on the box in the upper right portion of our sidebar. Membership costs $4.80 per month or $48 per year and gives you access to Power Line Live events as well as other occasional benefits like videos of Steve’s lectures. You will eliminate most ads on our site. And most important by becoming a VIP you support our work. The URL to become a VIP is now: https://subscriptions.powerlineblog.com So if you are a VIP please tune in Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Central. If you aren’t please consider subscribing.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
