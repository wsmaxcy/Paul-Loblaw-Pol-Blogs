L, NYT: Party Of Freedom Fries And Birtherism Abandoned Issue-Oriented Politics!, Steve M., 04-11-21, Really New York Times?  Republican lawmakers are passing voting restrictions to pacify right-wing activists still gripped by former President Donald J.  Trump’s lie that a largely favorable election was rigged against them.  G.O.P. leaders are lashing out in Trumpian fashion at businesses  baseball and the news media to appeal to many of the same conservatives  and voters. And debates over the size and scope of government have been  overshadowed by the sort of culture war clashes that the tabloid king  relished....  [Trump's] preference for engaging in red-meat political fights rather  than governing and policymaking have left party leaders in a state of  confusion over what they stand for....  Having quite literally  abandoned their traditional party platform last year to accommodate Mr.  Trump Republicans have organized themselves around opposition to the  perceived excesses of the left and borrowed his scorched-earth tactics  as they do battle. Right -- the GOP that's fixated on culture-war talk today is totally different from the  GOP that attacked John Kerry for speaking French  (at a time when right-wingers loathed the Iraq-war-skeptical French  government and cheered the rebranding of French fries in congressional  dining halls as "freedom fries").  It's totally different from the GOP that was obsessed with Barack  Obama's birth certificate or Bill Clinton's sex life or Hillary  Clinton's health.  It’s a strikingly different approach from the last time  Democrats had full control of government in 2009 and 2010 when  conservatives harnessed the Great Recession to stoke anger about  President Barack Obama and federal spending on their way to sweeping  midterm gains. Yes the anger at Obama was strictly fiscal.  The fight against Obamacare seemed like a policy fight but in retrospect it was obviously a "You want to give free stuff to Those  People" fight. Is the Times still unable to acknowledge that?  The party that hates voting rights now is the party that hated ACORN in the Obama years. The party that hates "cancel culture" now is the party  that once hated...   I'm stating the obvious though I wish it were obvious to the Times.
