I’m a lucid vivid dreamer.  It’s more often than not that I can recall at least partially a dream from any sleep period during the past twenty-four hours.  Some (many actually) of those dreams are just really really weird.  Only a rare few are what you’d call nightmares.  Sometimes I wake up from them laughing but most of the time when I wake up and am cognizant that I’ve just been dreaming a bizarre dream my reaction is “Where in the HELL did that come from?” To recap what we know about dreams: sleepfoundation.org: Studies have revealed diverse types of dream content but some typical characteristics of dreaming include: Although these features are not universal they are found at least to some extent in most normal dreams. Debate continues among sleep experts4 about why we dream. Different theories5 about the purpose of dreaming6 include: Experts in the fields of neuroscience and psychology continue to conduct experiments to discover what is happening in the brain during sleep but even with ongoing research it may be impossible to conclusively prove any theory for why we dream. Sometimes I can recall elements of my dreams that have a correlation to a real-life experience other times there seems to be no reality connection at all.  One recurring type of dream that I’ve been having over the past few years is being in a house where the rooms keep changing and I’m trying to find my way through them and can never get to where I want to go.  Another weird recurrence is I’m trying to fix something or get something organized like packing a suitcase and it just gets worse and worse.  Maybe this stems from ordinary frustrations encountered in daily life.  I truly have no idea. I used to fly in my dreams actually fly with just my body in the air getting airborne with repetitive jumps off the ground like being on a trampoline but there is no trampoline involved.  Once airborne I can glide for a fair distance but can’t stay up very long and eventually return safely to the ground.  But it seems I no longer have those kinds of dreams.  I sure can’t remember having any of those recently. I won’t talk about my more disturbing dreams only to say that sometimes I come awake only to find I’m still dreaming and know I’m still dreaming and want to wake up with a passion but it’s a real struggle and may take several attempts.  When I do come awake finally sometimes I’m breathing heavily and my heart is racing.  I’m very relieved to be awake and out of the dream. It’s weird.  But I interpret it as a sign that I’m just normal and my brain is working fine.  I know I’ve got a well-functioning imagination.  Maybe my lucid dreams are just that part of my brain where my imagination is left to work unrestrained by the distracting real-world inputs of the waking life.  Or maybe I just have a well-developed prefrontal cortex. webmd.com: What Are Lucid Dreams? Lucid dreams are when you know that you’re dreaming while you’re asleep. You’re aware that the events flashing through your brain aren’t really happening. But the dream feels vivid and real. You may even be able to control how the action unfolds as if you’re directing a movie in your sleep. ***** Neuroscientists don’t know exactly how and why lucid dreams happen. But they have some ideas. For one thing studies have found physical differences in the brains of people who do and don’t have lucid dreams. The very front part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex -- the site of high-level tasks like making decisions and recalling memories -- is bigger in people who have lucid dreams. That suggests that folks who are most likely to have lucid dreams tend to be self-reflective types who chew over thoughts in their heads. ***** Benefits of Lucid Dreams Lucid dreams might help your waking life with benefits like: I can name at least one benefit of lucid dreaming:  it gave me something to write about and share. How about you?  Care to share anything about your own dreaming?  But only if you’re comfortable doing so.  What else would you like to talk about today?
