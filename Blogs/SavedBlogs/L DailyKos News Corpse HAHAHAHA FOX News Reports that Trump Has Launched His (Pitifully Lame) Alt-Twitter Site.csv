L, HAHAHAHA: FOX News Reports that Trump Has Launched His (Pitifully Lame) Alt-Twitter Site, News Corpse, 2021-05-04, About six months ago Donald Trump was booted off of several social media sites including Twitter Facebook and YouTube. His exile was prompted by his relentless lying particularly about the COVID pandemic and his delusional "Big Lie" that the 2020 presidential election was "rigged" and "stolen" from him. Ever since then crybaby Trump has whined that he's a victim of a clandestine techie cabal determined to silence him. He also promised that he would eventually return to the InterTubes with his own social media platform. And now according to Fox News that time has come. The announcement was made on the Fox website in an article headlined: "Trump launches new communications platform months after Twitter Facebook ban." It began... However a link to Trump's new "communications platform" reveals something decidedly underwhelming. Firstly it's just a subpage of his current website. Secondly it's nothing more than an old school blog. And even at that it's lacking the standard features that exist on every other blog including the ability for visitors to post comments. As Fox News describes it... WOW! This highly advanced technology was produced by Trump's former campaign manager Brad Parscale who is currently under investigation for stealing $40 million from Trump's campaign. In addition to the pathetic implementation of this alt-Twitter farce the claim that it was just launched is also untrue. Trump already has posts going back to March 24. Although the most recent post is short video that hysterically oversells the blog saying that... Sure. A place to speak freely but only for Trump since no comments are allowed. And as a Trump property you can rest assured that it will fulfill its mission to be a beacon of lies. But for the most part it's primarily an outlet for Trump to vent incoherently the way he used to on Twitter. So far his posts have lashed out his critics praised his sycophants and always - ALWAYS - promulgating the "Big Lie." that he's the "real" president being oppressed by an imaginary cabal of "Deep State" usurpers. So it's really no different than a Trump cult rally. The same anger and hostility The same undeserved bragging. The same feeding of his voracious ego. And the same constant avalanche of flagrant falsehoods. All wrapped up in a sorry little 1990s style weblog that isn't even marginally interactive. It's just another sad and humiliating failure for America's Biggest Loser the former reality TV game show host and the current leader of the Republican Party.
