L, Biden's won a few farmer's hearts., LL Brown, 2021-07-07,          Imagine you just bought a new unused house for $350000. You find out you need to replace the water heater. You go down to Home Depot and find out you not only have to buy the heater from the builder but his people have to replace it at $200 hr.      That's what's been happening in rural america. John Deere et. al. have been keeping their dish tool as a Corp jewel and not letting farmers fix their own!      Been a lot of fellows not buying new green or red or orange toys. This might change soon only problem is there is NO new iron in dealer lots of any horsepower. And just a fly speck of faded painted iron.        The good news is: " A source familiar with the executive order said it will also encourage the Federal Trade Commission to limit the ability of agricultural equipment manufacturers to force farmers to have their equipment repaired at dealers instead of using independent repair shops or doing repairs themselves. Currently some tractor makers use proprietary tools and software to force farmers to go to dealers for repairs."  apnews.com/...
