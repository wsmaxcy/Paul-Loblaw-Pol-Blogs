L, Have You Shredded Anything Other Than A Guitar Riff Lately?, klaarity, 2021-04-18, In the process of getting ready for an appointment with my tax preparer I realized that it’s probably time to get rid of some of my oldest tax records (I’ve got paperwork that dates back to before the milllennium). I’m street-smart enough to know that I need to be careful about how I get rid of such records but when I googled the topic not surprisingly I found a great many companies who specialize in shredding and document security who all recommend that I shred EVERYTHING from junk mail to sales receipts to old napkins with phone numbers jotted on them.  My question to the group is:  okay come on what do I REALLY need to shred and what can I safely recycle?  Shredding companies charge by the pound and those pounds add up fast. But I do want to be safe with my personal financial info.  Any advice?
