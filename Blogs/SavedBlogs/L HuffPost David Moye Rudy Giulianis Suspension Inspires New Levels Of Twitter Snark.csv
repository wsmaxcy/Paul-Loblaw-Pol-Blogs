L, Rudy Giuliani's Suspension Inspires New Levels Of Twitter Snark, David Moye, 2021-06-24, The suspension of Rudy Giuliani’s law license represents a fall from grace for the former New York City mayor but it also inspired Twitter users to new heights of snark. On Thursday a five-judge panel suspended Giuliani from practicing law in New York state based on his record of making “demonstrably false and misleading statements” about the election loss of his client former President Donald Trump. Folks on Twitter used the occasion to drag Giuliani ― and it got brutal. Good thing Giuliani has that lucrative MyPillow sponsorship. https://t.co/ijjc0gkMEv Thank you for your service Borat's daughter https://t.co/rIj2Ai8uIx Now may he fade away to the great pervy hotel room in the sky. https://t.co/T0VNDHdqUQ 4 seasons total landscaping for the win. https://t.co/pinOKsq31B HAAAAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!Roy Cohn sends his salutations from the fires of hell. https://t.co/llOz08JN6c Imagine "Marrying Your Cousin" not even cracking the top 10 of most embarrassing things about you https://t.co/4vyGn2kIOk Some pointed out that this just isn’t Giuliani’s year.
