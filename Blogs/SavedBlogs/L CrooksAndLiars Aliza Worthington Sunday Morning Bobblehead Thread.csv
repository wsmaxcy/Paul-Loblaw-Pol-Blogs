L, Sunday Morning Bobblehead Thread, Aliza Worthington, 2021-05-30, I was taught in elementary school to never use an Oxford comma. It was not until I was an adult that I learned I'd been educated into one side of a great grammatical debate or even that what I was being told to NOT use was called the Oxford comma. I was simply taught that when lists were written out in a sentence they went "A B and C." *shrug* That's how I did it. It's what Mrs. Dounay taught me. I've since changed my ways as I have since Mrs. Seigel my typing teacher in 7th grade instilled the dogma of two spaces after typing a period. I'm flexible in thought that way. It sure is fun though to participate in the debate that still rages on. And always remember to use the Oxford comma kids. pic.twitter.com/m6X1Mq95dR — agustina vergara cid (@agustinavcid) May 28 2021 I'm a staunch supporter of the Oxford Comma but I'm more of a supporter of the theory that Harry Reid was also a secret member of Blink 182 therefore: pic.twitter.com/t1K1Fq3xQq — Milton Lawson (@citizenmilton) May 29 2021 Harry Reid waking up today and finding out people may think he’s the lead singer of Blink-182.. pic.twitter.com/jphT1QL5XC — teatime75 (@teatime75) May 29 2021 I took this photo at my first @blink182 concert. Man Harry Reid sure nailed those songs. https://t.co/PKvFcb9PjX pic.twitter.com/TMvAdpswO7 — THRILLHO (@perfectlycrom) May 29 2021 Now of course there's the argument that only a COMPLETE IDIOT would read that title as written to mean that Harry Reid was (1) a terrorist interrogator (2) the singer from Blink-182 AND (3) the one who took UFOs mainstream because there was no second comma after "Blink-182." You could make that argument if you wanted to. Or you could lighten up and just enjoy a little silliness on the bird app. *********** Here's your Memorial Day Sunday morning line-up in case you're paying the slightest bit of attention to politics this weekend!
