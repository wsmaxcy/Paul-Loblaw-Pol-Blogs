L, Send love to India!, TexMex, 2021-04-30, Good morning!  Watching the news about the horrible spread of Covid 19 in India makes me very sad. But one thing that help is to tell you about ShelterBox.  ShelterBox is an organization that provides aid during a disaster. Especially SHELTER!  Many years ago this Daily Kos community rocked and knocked down their website with donations.  It was during the terrible earthquake in Haiti that destroyed homes buildings and hospitals.  The disaster threw everyone out into the elements. As doctors were flying to help with the disaster ShelterBox jumped in and set up large tents that served as hospitals.  Doctors performed amputations in as clean a place as could be established thanks to ShelterBox.  ShelterBox is a international project  supported by Rotary International.  Rotarians around the world fundraise and supply support and volunteers that help to distribute aid.  ShelterBox takes donations from small amounts to large amounts.  We raised over 130000 dollars for the Haitian crisis alone! I wasn’t the only person that wrote diaries to help.   Through out the years I have come back over and over again to ask for your help. Over and over you have donated to them when I asked.  So….  I am asking that you visit  ShelterBox USA Asking that you donate. Please a little goes alooooong way.   To see what equipment is provided click this link and click on “show me” to see how ShelterBox has developed more things to help with disaster aid   ShelterBox Blog  Also ….
