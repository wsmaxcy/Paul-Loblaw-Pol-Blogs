L, Chinese rocket tube to interface with Earth soon, MTmofo, 2021-05-08,  A huge section of a Chinese Long March 5B rocket is falling back to Earth and debris may land sometime Saturday evening or later — if the rocket doesn't burn up on the way down. The rocket could hit Earth around 11:30 p.m. EST Saturday according to calculations by Aerospace Corporation a California-based non-profit group that operates a space research and development center. Where exactly remains a mystery — for now. As of Saturday morning Aerospace Corporation's projections put a large swath of the U.S. near projected paths of the rocket after the predicted reentry time. A Saturday morning projection placed the rocket's predicted reentry over the Atlantic Ocean. Another model by CelesTrak.com showed the rocket likely landing somewhere in the Indian Ocean. www.msn.com/… This is the CelesTrak link.  Currently it is over the Indian Ocean and might catch the SW tip of OZ.  It is a real time display with Lat/Long/Alt/Speed. mapshot.app/...
