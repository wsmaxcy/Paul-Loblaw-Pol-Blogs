C, Part 3: Gather the Goons – Team Construction and Practical Survival, Talon2, 2020-12-11, PSA: This is the 3rd time I have posted this and I will continue to do so until we win the GA Senate Runoffs. First before we get into the Diary Entry – If you live in GA – vote for Perdue and Loeffler – I don’t care what Lin Wood Sidney Powell Ali or Cernovich said. We can deal with the Governor Brian Kemp and that weasel of and SoS later.  Boycotting the vote is about the dumbest idea I have heard the last couple of days. And where I work stupid ideas are like blades of grass.  Yes hinky stuff happened yes it should be investigated yes people should go to jail no we should not gift wrap the Senate to Schumer so he can put the Constitution in a paper shredder and turn the U.S.A. into Venezuela 2.0 Starvation Boogaloo to make a point to “Own the Cons”. To quote COL Schlichter: “We can win outside the margin of fraud. We just can’t do it if pouting whiners sit home muttering about how they are mad cuz things didn’t go their way last time.” Note before we begin: I am using twitter handles as some of the folks mentioned wished to remain as anonymous as possible while still being part of this. *Steps off soap Box* Previously we have covered the current operating environment the importance of building a team and executing missions at the lowest level to build team cohesion work out issues and gain experience. Remember we are fighting a much larger more well financed ruthless more numerous (at least tactically) foe.  These seemingly insurmountable strengths will be their downfall. With size comes issues The left has become used to the right rolling over and showing their belly every time they lob an accusation at us.  Remember Mittens during the Candy Crowley Debate? The left has locked themselves into an ideology of totalitarianism and cannot breakaway from if for fear of their base.  They have become unable to fight the ideological war and are dependent upon legacy media and the tech titans to censor and ban us.  Yes I am on twitter and facebook. I also have backup plans should I ever get the full Alex Jones treatment. This leaves and incredible opportunity for us to build new coalitions that will ensure lasting electoral success and the survival of the United States we all know. But in order to do that to have our Flag hanging over the remains of the bombed out husk of the leftist Fuhrerbunker we must first build the support team around ourselves that will allow us to do that. How do you go about building your team?  Well it depends on a couple of things.  1. Where do you live/Where can you look for recruits? 2. What is this team going to be used for? 3. What are their Skills and how long have you know them? Getting pretty complicated huh? Well no one said this is going to be easy.  Lets go through it line by line. This is a long process and shouldn’t be undertaken lightly.  This is going to require hours upon hours of painstaking work in order to ensure that the group you are building is capable of accomplishing the tasks you have set for them.   There is plenty of additional reading that you can do that will delve into the details of cell construction training and individual duties and responsibilities.  I would recommend you start with the following reading materials for further discussions on team construction. This is not an exhaustive list but will certainly get you on your way. Practical Survival: What I am not going to do in this section: Tell you what gun to buy what plate carrier /chest rig to buy what bug out bag to buy etc.  That’s all personal choice.  If you need advice I would recommend you reach out on twitter to the following people: Just to name a few. They have gear threads gun threads and medical threads that should be able to fill in most of the blanks.  What I am here to help you with is this.  When the leftists come for you – and make no mistake they will come for you – what do you need to ensure that you will be able to make a getaway with the people and equipment you will need to live to fight another day.  One of my twitter follows is a person by the name of @furyoriental and he had this to say: Lesson from my refugee parents. Always had 24K jewelry hidden in the house. Dad Said “If the commies/gov/bandits ever come we’ll use this to escape. Break off a link = a meal A Bracelet = a car A necklace = get someone out of jail or camp. Now it is a shame that I have to write those words in the United States of America in 2020.  But here we are.  Remember take the left at their word.  They want us impoverished silenced broken reeducated or dead.  Now some of you are going to say “but Talon the police/sheriffs/National Guard will protect us – we are good!” Really?  You want to go with that?  How is that working out for the people in Portland Seattle Chicago NYC Kenosha and all of the other cities and towns that were engulfed by leftist violence looting and murder over the summer? Did you not see the police being recalled the NG being told to stand down and the populace being terrorized at will by those degenerates with little to no repercussions? Understanding that fact what can we do about it to ensure that should we be caught behind enemy lines should we be caught unawares what can we do to help ourselves live to fight another day?  First keep cash around the house.  Yes physical cash/precious metals.  How much is up to you.  I am a bit on the paranoid side so I try to keep a not unsubstantial amount of precious metals foldable cash and jewelry on hand.  Keep it hidden well so the kids can’t find it but not so well that when the Antifa Hit squad shows up your bribe money is no where to be found.  Don’t be afraid to use Jewelry like @furyoriental said above.  If It can get you out of a jam who cares if it was your mothers you cant do anything with it if you are dead. Keep a bugout bag in the house within easy reach.  There are about a 1000000 threads with what should go into a bug out bag.  Here is a list to get you started.  I would add to and not take away from this.  Personalize a bag for each family member.  Take into account their unique needs and likes.  Remember you are going to need to survive with nothing but what you have in that bag so make it count. If you haven’t already – buy a firearm.  Preferably a shotgun pistol and rifle.  I am not going to tell you what to buy just don’t buy a Springfield XD or a Kimber.  This is one of those “if you know you know” moments.  Find something you like and can handle.  Like I said if you have a specific question on what is best for you individual situation ask the guys I listed out above. Many gun ranges will rent weapons of the type they have for sale so you can try before you buy.  Take a class on weapons safety. Train with you weapon of choice.  Buying it is only the first step.  You have to spend time out on the range. For the specifics of engagement criteria I would recommend you read Prairie Fire @offthe_res  lays out the differences between evolutions of the oncoming suckage and what are some ways to handle them as the threat matrix increases. Ok the time comes you have got your bribe money your bugout bags are packed and assembled and you have something to protect yourself with.  You hear the beginning of the riots about 3 blocks over and your team mate from the next subdivision calls you and tells you the Antifa goons are going house to house he and his girlfriend are rolling out in 5.  Now what? You gather up the wife your two kids and Doggo and jump in the car to make your escape.  Now what? Well how much gas does your car have?  You keep the car topped off right? You keep at least a half a tank in gas cans in the garage right? You have done route planning that keep you off the main highways and out of sight right? You have driven this route before and cached things along this route that will allow you to survive right?  You have a car bag with extra belts fluids and consumable parts to ensure that should something outside of a major component fail you can still repair your vehicle and get to safety right?  You have comms cellphone CB radio GMRS or otherwise to the rest of your team right? All of these things and many others must be considered so that you are not the ones that end up at the bottom of a ditch begging for your life.  I am not saying this to scare anyone or to dredge up anxiety.  Uncertainty leads to anxiety anxiety leads to fear fear leads to paralysis and paralysis leads to death. I have seen what things can turn into.  I was in Iraq in 2007-8 when the Sectarian violence was at its worst.  I know what it looks like and I know what it feels like and to be honest with everyone we are not that far off.  I truly hope it nothing happens that we can back off from the brink but I just don’t see it.   Knowing all of this knowing that the left wants to crush us and ensure we can never rise again what are you prepared to do about it? Part 4: Gather the Goons – Intelligence Gathering and Exploitation Part 5: Gather the Goons – Make Yourself and your organization Indispensable Part 6: Gather the Goons – The War of the Flea – How to beat Leviathan (P.S. I recommend that you buy both of @offthe_res books Concrete Jungle and Prairie Fire – as someone who has served overseas and seen my fair share of combat it taught me a lot.  For those that have not had the fortunate (unfortunate?) experience of combat it will provide you a base of knowledge that will help you through trying times.) (SOLATAC is one of the best Medical Suppliers of Field Expedient Kits out there.  If you have a specific request Demp and Mrs. Demp can build you pretty much whatever you want.) (If you believe in the 2A and want to actually donate to an organization that does something and doesn’t just line their board of directors pockets I suggest you donate or join either Firearms policy Coalition @gunpolicy Gun Owners of America @Gunowners or Second Amendment Foundation @2AFDN) Link to Prairie Fire Link to Solatac Link to Bug Out Bag Packing Lists Full Disclosure – I have zero monied interests in these recommendations – if they were terrible I would say so and would not be recommending them.  They are the heat.  I would not stake my reputation on them if I thought them lacking.
