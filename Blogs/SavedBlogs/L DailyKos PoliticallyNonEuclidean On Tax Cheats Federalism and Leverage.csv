L, On Tax Cheats Federalism and Leverage, PoliticallyNonEuclidean, 2021-06-30, Much has been said about the way that the Republicans have underfunded the IRS in order to make it impossible for that agency to collect from high earners. For a long time this has been treated as the end of the story but it doesn’t have to be as is suggested by the investigations in New York. While the tax audit of the Trump Organization has allegedly been underway for at least six years and was Trump’s excuse for not releasing his taxes the state investigations seem ready to release indictments within six months of receiving Trump’s tax returns.    So why can’t this be repeated in other states not only on Trump’s properties but with other major companies and individuals? They pay state taxes and I can’t believe that they are more honest on those filings. Why can’t the states conduct aggressive audits that will pay for themselves in back taxes collected fines and increased revenues – and then share data about fraud with the IRS? The better funded states could do the detective work that will make clear the pattern of tax evasion and share it with other states too so authorities there will know what to look for.   Trump has golf courses and branded hotels in many Democratically controlled states and though he has plenty of lawyers and accountants to obfuscate and delay the states may patiently expend resources with a reasonable expectation of getting what they spend back and then some. They must not settle for a penny less than what is owed plus interest plus the cost of the investigation with the option of filing criminal charges against the accountants and auditors who certified the paperwork. Those accountants and auditors who have abetted fraudshould be reported to the organizations that certify their field and are empowered to apply sanctions.    This should not be limited to Trump or Republican owned companies. I’m sure a lot of Silicon Valley execs who contribute to Democrats have a very Republican attitude toward paying taxes and they need to be prosecuted with equal zeal. We must clean our own house and be seen to do so.    This should not be a secret project. I want to see this strategy announced partly because of the bind it will put Republicans in. Make them defend cheating on taxes every day and everywhere. Make them explain why disaster aid must be cut and roads must crumble because their donors need to hide their wealth from taxes that are the lowest in any major economy. Make state attorneys-general who fail to follow up on leads from other states explain why they decline to get that revenue. Make them squirm and then ignore them and go about the business of recovering the funds that are owed by billionaires who refuse the pittance that is their share to keep our economy running.     I would like to see an emphasis on tax honesty in Democratic campaigns for state Attorney Generals Secretaries of State Treasurers and Governors. It will be interesting to see how the Republican opponents respond to that too. One party must demand honesty and transparency and let the other defend corruption and cheating. Let America decide which they prefer.  If there is a reason this is impractical please let me know.
