L, Seth Meyers Has Some Legal Advice For Rudy , Frances Langum, 2021-05-04, Seth Meyers has two very important pieces of legal advice for Rudy Giuliani.  First of all you kinda ruin your whole "attorney-client privilege" thing if you blab all your communications to Laura Ingraham on Fox News while the cameras are running.   "I'm no legal expert" said Meyers but I'm pretty sure attorney-client privilege goes away when you read the documents on national television." Then Meyers spoke in Rudy's voice to the Fox News audience: "Okay!  You're ALL my clients!"   Meyers also attempted to "help" Rudy with the timeline of events noting that the Justice Department tapped into Rudy's iCloud while Trump Rudy's client was the so-called president.  Meyers wondered if Trump was actually trying to get Rudy arrested.  Rudy is bragging on the streets of New York about participating in a Hamilton documentary (not the musical).  Nobody cares.
