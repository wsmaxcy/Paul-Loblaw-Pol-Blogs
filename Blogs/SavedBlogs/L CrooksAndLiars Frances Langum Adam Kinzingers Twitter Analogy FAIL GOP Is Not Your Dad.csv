L, Adam Kinzinger's Twitter Analogy FAIL: GOP Is Not 'Your Dad', Frances Langum, 04-13-21, Rep. Adam Kinzinger has this week's #Fail and it's only Tuesday.  Kinzinger is one of those never-Trumpers who some Democrats fall in love with because he says things that make them feel there may be some hope for bridging the divide between the parties.  Actual Democrats sent money to Kinzinger when he came out against Trump during Donald's impeachments plural.  And seriously fellow Democrats you HAVE to stop doing that.  Get some self-respect and stop sending money to any Republicans including the Lincoln Project.  Republicans of any stripe are NOT your friends.  After the dust settles they'll be coming after your Social Security and voting more tax cuts for billionaires.  It's who they are.  So Kinzinger decided Monday night to tweet an analogy that pretended to be nice to Democrats but which most people read as an unintended confession of "family" dysfunction.  I used to say Dems were the mom party and GOP was the dad party.  If you get hurt or need comfort go to mom.  If you need some tough truth or protection you go to dad.  It still works but now mom is trying to buy your love and dads been hitting the sauce. ‚Äî Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) April 13 2021  The Twitter replies followed a theme ahem.  Dad is an abusive racist psychotic POS and Mom has to clean up all the mess and trauma and deal with the gaslighting AND try to protect the fam from his threats even AFTER she has thrown him out. ‚Äî (((BadAtBalletüá∫üá∏))) (@AlizaWrites) April 13 2021 All I see is Mom trying to clean up a huge mess that Dad makes over & over Dad is selfish & cruel=like mocking the poor as he give his wealthy friends huge gifts (we can't afford & they don't need) he denys science insults Mom and takes no blame for the mess our family is in ‚Äî funnygurlscope (@funnygirlescope) April 13 2021 Dad is a racist. ‚Äî arman walker (@armanwalker) April 13 2021 Hey that‚Äôs great. You know how we can hold ‚Äúdad‚Äù accountable for his terrible behavior?Pass #HR1. ‚Äî Angela Hamade (@heyaries1981) April 13 2021 Mom's trying to make the home secure safe productive and comfortable while dad spends the money on teenagers illegal drugs and booze while blaming mom for all his problems. ‚Äî Sue wears a mask. You should too. BLM. (@SueBanski) April 13 2021 Mom‚Äôs trying to make sure that you have the resources necessary for a future when you aren‚Äôt the only big kid on the block.
