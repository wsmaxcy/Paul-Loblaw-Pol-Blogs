C, Blame it on the bossa nova, Scott Johnson, 2021-02-13, University of Pennsylvania’s Henry Charles Lea Professor Emeritus of History Alan Kors writes regarding Andrea Mitchell. Mitchell you may recall presumed to instruct Ted Cruz on the source of the phrase “full of sound and fury signifying nothing.” Purporting to correct Cruz’s attribution of the phrase to Shakespeare Mitchell attributed it to Faulkner while demonstrating her ignorance of both Shakespeare and Faulkner. Mitchell is a prominent NBC/MSNBC reporter and host but Professor Kors wants us to know: “It’s worse than you think.” Professor Kors cites The Andrea Mitchell Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of Pennsylvania: “The Andrea Mitchell Center was created in 2017 through the generous support of Andrea Mitchell currently NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent….as well as the Chair of Penn’s Board of Overseers for the School of Arts and Sciences.” Professor Kors comments: “The appalling arrogant and ignorant lady with the F’s on Shakespeare and Faulkner is Chair of the Board of Overseers for the School of Arts and Science of the University of Pennsylvania!” Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
