An ad hoc cadre of building professionals and gifted amateurs attempt to answer questions that arise from readers and offer encouragement and advice for those inclined to do things for themselves if they can. We all do a lot of things collectively and can probably help out with insights from our vast experience. Or sometimes we just gab. Have an interesting story or project to share? Contact Glen The Plumber about posting it for Saturday Morning Home Repair. happy may day: today is good day to mention the recent passing of a personal hero Fred Hirsch. he and I both proud 393 plumbers. although he was from my dad’s era he was an icon for a young radical going thru their apprenticeship. as an apprentice I stood with Fred against the more conservative union leaders...still have my ‘32 or fight’ button Fred gave me. another fight that Fred lost but I still believe he was right.  he also lost when he represented my local at the UA convention where he campaigned for the UA to reject the XL pipeline. when he went to help farmworkers unionize he was beat by police. in my eyes...although he suffered some losses...he still made an impact. always pushing forward. he didn’t just irk the powers that be in my local...he also started the first cop watch program in San Jose. they were not happy. and you could say he created the modern jury selection process. during the Angela Davis trials he and few others researched prospective jurists and provided the info to her attorneys. when I my neighbor and few others organized an event in San Jose it felt like a win when Fred showed up. our group sorta fell apart but Raul Peralez is now running for mayor. and I was always glad to run into Fred when out with my little one at protests...a confirmation we were on the right side of an issue. rest in peace my brother the struggle continues. here are some video tributes to Fred.
