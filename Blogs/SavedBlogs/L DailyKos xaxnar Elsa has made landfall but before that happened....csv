L, Elsa has made landfall but before that happened..., xaxnar, 2021-07-07, Good luck to all those who are now feeling the impact of Elsa last seen as a tropical storm heading up across Florida into Georgia. For those of you who have been tracking the storm and the predictions of where it would go the plane in the picture above is one of the ways they get the info that goes into the computer models and forecasts based on them. Here’s a report on how they handled Elsa: KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE Miss. --  The Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Hurricane Hunters wrapped up their aerial reconnaissance efforts for Tropical Storm Elsa Wednesday morning July 7 after the storm made landfall on the northwest coast of Florida. The 53rd WRS is assigned to the 403rd Wing and is the only unit of its kind in the Department of Defense. In coordination with the National Hurricane Center and the Chief Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination All Hurricanes the unit flies missions into tropical systems to collect atmospheric data used by forecasters to create more accurate models. The aircraft you see in the photo at the top of this post is a special version of the C-130 Hercules an aircraft type that has served around the world in various roles since 1956. The latest models are up to the J series. To accomplish their mission the squadron has 10 specially modified WC-130J Super Hercules aircraft. A basic crew consists of two pilots one navigator one aerial reconnaissance weather officer and a loadmaster/dropsonde operator. Using stepped frequency microwave radiometers attached to the wings and dropsondes that deploy from the aircraft via a specialized pallet the crew is able to measure atmospheric properties--such as rainfall wind speed and direction barometric pressure and dewpoint--that can’t easily be detected by satellite. The ARWO reviews the data in-flight and sends it in real-time to the NHC who integrate it into their models prompting appropriate guidance for residents in affected areas…. (Speaking of Herks here’s another unit with unique capabilities and missions.) A hurricane tracking operation can take days as storms form and build up across the Atlantic the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. (The Pacific as well.) Aircraft supplies and crews will operate out of whatever airfields are best positioned for flights. ...For the bulk of the missions into Elsa the squadron sent a routine deployment package--three aircraft three aircrews and maintenance personnel--to operate out of Homestead Air Reserve Base Florida. “The biggest factor in deciding to go to Homestead was that some of the models had Elsa going close to our normal forward operating location St. Croix so that was the best option to reach the storm” said Capt. Stephen Bichsel 53rd WRS mission commander for the operations at Homestead. “It was very easy working with airfield management at Homestead and the 482nd Operations Support Squadron did great accommodating us so we could get the mission done.” After a total of five missions out of Homestead Elsa approached Cuba as a strong tropical storm late July 4. The deployed aircraft made their way back home before conditions in South Florida began to deteriorate. The unit continued to support reconnaissance efforts from here until landfall flying an additional four missions and could possibly resume missions if the system remains a threat once it reaches the Atlantic. Flights into and back from a storm normally take hours; the usual flight path on reaching the storm is to fly across it turn and come around to fly across it again at right angles taking measurements the whole time.  The Hurricane Hunter missions usually track a storm until landfall. At that point ground-based instruments can provide data along with radar satellite imagery etc. In the case of Elsa there may be followup missions if it remains a threat if/when it moves offshore from the East Coast as the article notes.  The Keesler operation is part of a larger effort by NOAA involving both civilian and military aircraft. They track storms in the Pacific as well; a few months ago the WC-130s were flying out of Reno NV to track the atmospheric rivers that bring snow and rain to the West Coast in the winter months. There’s more here on the the 403rd Wing and on Keesler Air Force Base. With hurricane season off to another record start there will be more news coming out of there in the months ahead. A personal observation. Not everything the military does is about bombs and bullets; getting information like this providing disaster relief and recovery providing support for other government agencies like NOAA planning for contingencies of all kinds — they are part of the package as well. This is one way the troops — and the government — support us. As the climate crisis builds this kind of service is going to become more and more vital.  Update: One more way the military provides vital services. A third specially equipped Air Force C-130 joined firefighting efforts in California this week as flames burned in five large fires in northern California. The latest Modular Airborne Firefighting System-equipped C-130H from the Nevada Air National Guard’s 152nd Airlift Wing began operating out of the former McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento Calif. on July 5. The C-130 flew three of the 13 total MAFFS retardant drops that day. “It’s an honor to do this mission—we take it to heart” MAFFS Mission Commander Capt. Jennifer Kanakis said in a 1st Air Force/Air Forces Northern release. “We’re responding with urgency to help suppress the fires.” MAFFS 8 joined MAFFS 9 another C-130H from the same unit and MAFFS 6 a C-130J from the California Air National Guard’s 146th Airlift Wing.
