L, All The Former Presidents Made This Pro-Vax Ad - With One Exception, Juanita Jean, 2021-03-14, All the former presidents and their wives cut an ad encouraging everyone to get the vaccine except for one.  You‚Äôll enjoy watching this especially seeing the picture of Jimmy Carter in the last shot. Donald Trump declined being in the ad but he did issue a statement. This new ‚Äústatement‚Äù from Trump is REAL. üëáüèª pic.twitter.com/biMJDPNjsu ‚Äî S.E. Cupp (@secupp) March 11 2021 If he hadn‚Äôt been president we probably wouldn‚Äôt need it.  I can guarantee you one thing ‚Äì I hope people remember that half a million people didn‚Äôt have to die if Trump had handled this competently.
