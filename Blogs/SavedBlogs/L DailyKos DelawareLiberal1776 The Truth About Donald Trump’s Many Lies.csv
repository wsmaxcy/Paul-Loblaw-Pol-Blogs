L, The Truth About Donald Trump’s Many Lies, DelawareLiberal1776, 2021-04-26, Donald Trump’s lying spree knows no end even when the truth is crystal clear he chooses to lie. Many of us think why? Because he has successfully fooled all the Republicans. It is time to expose Trump’s many lies though the list is long but I gave it a try. Only people who believe his lies are Republicans and no doubt that give him confidence. He got even worse after November 3 and went on a dangerous lying spree about the election he lost. Trump made many statements during his 4 years as President of the United States many of which turned out to be either untrue or partially true. Here are 4 of such thousands of statements made by the former President which could not withstand scrutiny. ” I ended family separation.”  When discussing about his inhuman policy which separated thousands of migrant children from their parents Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd in 2019 ”You know under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it.” In 2018 Trump signed an order to end separation policy but very conveniently forgot sharing with Todd that the policy he ended was made by him. “Covid-19 is like a regular flu.” Donald J. Trump’s lies about Covid=19 turned out to be extremely dangerous for Americans. During the earliest days of the Pandemic he created confusion among people and dismissed Covid as a regular flu which resulted in deadly consequences. On February 26 he said “This is a flu. This is like a flu… It is like the regular flu that we have flu shots for... And we will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.” Accusing Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of supporting al Qaeda  In 2019 Trump falsely accused Democrat Ilhan Omar of supporting al Qaeda. He contorted a 2013 quote from Omar to malign her to make everyone trust his lies that she is the supporter of terrorist group al Qaeda. He launched various racist attacks against her in the future. It is not hidden from anyone that Trump only promoted bigotry and misogyny during his 4 years in power. He was named Michigan’s Man of the Year  Since many years Trump has been falsely claiming he was once named Michigan’s Man of the Year. The lie is so funny it makes me laugh so hard. He never lived in Michigan so why would anyone present him with the Michigan’s Man of the Year title. Donald Trump has surely perfected the art of lying and no one can give him competition in that. Every time he breaks his own record and make us wonder if he ever uttered truth from his mouth.
