C, 'Temporary facility' going up in Donna Texas - right next to the one exposed by lawmakers' border visits , Karen Townsend, 2021-04-07, Additional housing is being provided for unaccompanied minors picked up at the southern border in Donna Texas. Recent reports from traveling lawmakers must have provided the motivation to spur on the Biden administration to ease the horrendous overcrowding of current facilities including one in Donna. The new shelter will be right next to that one as a matter of fact. Unless the Biden administration makes the decision to use catch and release for unaccompanied minors as it does with adults and families now there really isn’t any other choice but to put up more shelters. Children some very young children cannot sleep crammed up next to each other on concrete floors under foil FEMA emergency blankets for days on end. This message is being made clear as senators and members of the House of Representatives take tours of the U.S.-Mexico border including facilities holding illegal migrants. Senator Cruz brought the reality of a shelter in Donna to the public and it was shocking to see. Senator Cornyn released a video of a recent visit to the banks of the Rio Grande Valley. Rep. Henry Cuellar a Democrat released the first photos from Donna Texas. The Biden administration isn’t interested in listening to him either. These are all Texas lawmakers who are aware of the situation on the ground. Cruz suggests that Biden go back to Trump’s border policies but that would be too reasonable. And it would include Biden admitting he is wrong and Trump was right in how to handle surges of migrants crossing the southern border. It’s hard for Biden to call Trump a racist xenophobic if he utilizes the same policies. Axios reports that the new facility will allow the Biden administration “to release kids from border patrol custody faster — even while they remain in a temporary setting on land owned by Customs and Border Protection.” The new unit is called Delphi and will be overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration has been focused on getting minors out of border stations and into HHS supervision as soon as possible. The Rio Grande Valley sector which includes Donna has been receiving some of the largest numbers of migrants over the past few months. Border officials led a group of Republican lawmakers and staff on a tour of Delphi’s tent-like structures on Tuesday. Tuesday was the first day Delphi was open and 300 minors were being sent over. A fence was seen under construction past a parking lot at the border station. The facility will hold up to 1500 boys and girls from ages 13 to 17. Minors will be tested for COVID-19 before and during their stay at Delphi according to an HHS fact sheet. The Biden administration claims it is shrinking the huge number of unaccompanied minors in border control custody now reportedly under 5000. The overcrowding continues in the facilities. The pods intended for up to 48 people are now holding more than 300 one holding 500. This will continue as long as more than 500 non-Mexican minors cross the border every day as happened last month. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced on April 2 the opening of a soft-sided facility in Eagle Pass Texas. The facility’s primary purpose is to safely and expeditiously process individuals in U.S. Border Patrol custody. Eagle Pass is in the Del Rio Sector. The facility will be weatherproof climate-controlled and is expected to provide ample areas for eating sleeping and personal hygiene. The new facility’s design is similar to that of recently constructed soft-sided facilities. The 90000 square foot facility sits on five acres adjacent to the Eagle Pass South Station which houses the Del Rio Sector Central Processing Center. The temporary facility will provide additional processing capacity for Border Patrol’s Del Rio Sector. Those sound like some upscale-ish tent facilities.

The need for more new shelters will continue until the Biden administration admits to its self-imposed crisis on the southern border. The solution is to reinstate the Remain-in-Mexico agreement with Mexico and continue the work the Trump administration did to secure the border instead of cruelly encouraging illegal migration with promises of open borders and no consequences. Last week CBP announced the opening of a soft-sided facility in Eagle Pass TX to safely and expeditiously process people in U.S. Border Patrol custody.
