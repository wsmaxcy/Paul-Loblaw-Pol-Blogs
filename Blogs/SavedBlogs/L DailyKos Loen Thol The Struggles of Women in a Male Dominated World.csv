L, The Struggles of Women in a Male Dominated World, Loen Thol, 2021-04-21, “The Struggles of Women in a Male Dominated World” The other day I read a article titled “White Privilege” written by a white women in her 70’s about how she did not grow up with white privilege. This woman is an avid Trump supporter and lives in Florida. Her view of not having white privilege left me confused. Her examples she states for defending herself of not having white privilege just shows just how disconnected people such as her are from true reality. I think the article should of been titled “The struggles of women in a male dominated world”. This article actually addresses the struggle women encounter in the job market and how gender equality needs to change. The struggles she encountered are not a race issue. Imagine if she was a woman of color. How much more difficult would it have been? Because she is white doors were open to her that would of been closed if she was black. The struggles she encountered at home can happen in any color group not just white. Her story is typical in that women have to out perform men to achieve a position just below men in a male dominated society. In her early days a woman place was in the home. So men saw educated women as a threat. Men were viewed as the bread winner and were given higher salaries than women even if the woman was more qualified. Some of her statements about BLM and playing the race card proves the hidden racist mindset that runs underneath. To suggest people of color want sympathy and burn down buildings when they don’t get their way is just another sign of ignorance and racist mindset. People such as her live in a world that is clouded and their eyes are veiled with blinders. She begins with :I recently had a friend tell me that I had “white privilege”and so I wouldn’t understand the BLM movement or the need for protesting rioting and burning buildings down.Here’s what my White Privilege looks like...(What’s YOUR story...Maybe it is time for “white people”to share their own myth of white privilege. She continues :My mother and her family legally immigrated to the U.S. in 1929 through Ellis Island after nearly waiting 8 years to come here legally. They were called “wops”and “guineas”and were yelled at. They were all placed in first grade because they couldn’t speak English. They often had to sit in front of the class wearing a dunce hat. My mother finished the 8th grade. My father dropped out in the 10th grade. Both served in WWII in the navy. I was their first child and the oldest of 5 children. I had many chores as a child including ironing weeding washing dishes cleaning the bathroom helping prepare meals babysitting my younger siblings. By age 8 and up until I was about 12 I went around our neighborhood and offered to sweep the neighbor’s carports for 5 cents. I also weeded for neighbors. My siblings and I made taffy and sold it in the neighborhood. I picked up glass cola bottles by walking up and down the neighborhood streets to get enough money (2 cents per bottle) to go to the movies occasionally. At age 12 I also mowed lawns and babysat for 50 cents per hour.We had a very dysfunctional family. My father was physically and verbally abusive. He regularly beat us with straps that he made out of leather. He threw things broke things and left bruises on all of us. When he got mad he started drinking. He would even throw glasses full of whiskey at us. During this time is when I learned and understood the term “foaming at the mouth.”It was a regular occurrence in our home. He also used hairbrushes coat hangers and wooden sticks –whatever was handy. He broke dishes records and even threw our TV out in the yard when he got angry. On more than one occasion I had to get the younger children to my roomand we would leave the house through my bedroom window to hide in the back yard and/or the street behind our house. Once the screaming and breaking things had stopped we would climb back through the window to sleep. It was always at night. We were terrified. We didn’t know about White Privilege. All we wanted to do was survive the night.I had it bad we all did but my brother had it the worst. When I turned 15 and school was out in June I walked about 2miles from homeand applied for a job in every store in the shopping center. Then I walked to another Shopping center another 5 miles to apply to every store in that shopping center. The theatre offered me a job working behind the candy counter to sell candy popcorn and soft drinks for 85 cents an hour.There was a cash drawer but no cash-registerso I learned to give change by hand and had to balance to the penny every night.I continued that job through high school. After school each day I had to take two busses to get to the Theatre to work. When we were not busy the manager allowed me to study.Starting at age 15 I bought all of my own clothes. Previous to that time my mother would buy our clothes at the “thrift shop”or make them for us. Once I started earning a little money I bought my own clothes and contributed to buying groceries for the family each week. The last time my father hit me was when I was 18 and still living at home. He slapped me so hard across the face that I almost fell to the ground. I got face to face with him and told him that if he ever hit me again I would kill him. He could tell by the look in my eyes that I meant it. He never hit me again.After graduating from high school in the top half of my class (by only 2 spots) the counselors told my parents that I was not “college material” and should consider getting a trade. I went to work for the local bank and worked in the trust department because I was good at math (from counting change at the movie theatre).”At age 19 I entered the Medical Technician program at the local medical center. The program was 9 months long and required that all graduating technicians work another 9 months to repay our education. I finished in the top of my class. I decided to go to college to obtain an AA degree.My boss and Pathologist at the hospital told me that based on my SAT scores and my high school grades I would have only about a 25% chance of finishing the 2-year program. I asked to be put on the night shift at the hospital so I could take college classes in the mornings. I worked with 2 other medical technicians and we worked 4 p.m. –midnight with every third night staying until 7 a.m. the next morning.I also worked from 2 p.m. –4 p.m. every weekday in a physician’s office laboratory.It took me 7 years to finish my AA degree at the Community College graduating Cum Laude with a 3.5 grade point average.I then attended the local university to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Biology and Medical Technology with a minor in Chemistry. The admissions office told me that it was impossible to earn that degree going part time. At that point I had two children and was divorced. I was working full time as a Medical Technologist and Medical Laboratory Supervisor with specialties in hematology and immunohematology. I managed the laboratory for a 4-doctor medical practice. They fired the previous med tech for poor work and offered me the job but paid me less than the man because they claimed “he had a family to raise.”I told them that I also had a family to raise. I had two wonderful sons to raise as a divorced mother. It made no difference to them. It was typical at that time for women to make less than men.At the University I had one chemistry professor who believed that women did not make as good a chemist as men did. I had an A average in his class but he still gave me a B. His reason was that three men had scored higher than I didand he only gave three A’s. The second term I had the same Chemistry professor. I had the highest average in the class. This time I also received a B. He said he didn’t give out any A’s this term. I complained but he had tenure so I had no standing.While I attended both the community college  and the university I took copious notes and even recorded the lectures. I played the tapes in my car while driving and kept my notes with me everywhere I went. If I was waiting in line at the grocery store I would review my notes. Waiting in the doctor’s office for my appointmentI reviewed my notes. I did not watch TV or go out with my friends.After 10 years of going to college I earned my bachelor’s degree with a 3.82 G.P.A. Magna cum Laude and the Biology Student of the Year and in the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society. I borrowed no money to pay for my classes I had no scholarships and in fact had to argue each semester with the finance office about the fact that I could not pay the entire tuition up front but would give them money every payday.They always got paid on time!After graduating from the university I was hired by the local telephone company as an Outside Plant Engineer. The local telephone company had been investigated and fined for discriminatory hiring practices against women in the Engineering Department. I had to take several pre-hire tests and tested extremely well on all tests. I was offered a job right away. Soon after hire I was sent to Atlanta for 2 weeks of training. During that time I and other female engineers weretreated as intruders. On more than one occasion I had a handwritten note slipped under my hotel room door that stated “Go home! You are taking a job away from a man!”Needless to say Iand other woman had to work much harder to gain the respect of the predominately male workforce. I have to give the Construction Department credit for their willingness to work with women who displayed a strong work ethic and a willingness to coordinate with them on telephone cable installation projects. After earning my MBA with a dual concentration in Management and Marketing I went to work for the local Cable company. I was the first woman hired as a Director. At the first Director’s Meeting Bill a long time Director in the Installation Department asked me to take notes of the meeting. I stated that I was willing to “take a turn at it.”The president an amazing individual told Bill that he would take notes and not me.Bill continued to show contempt toward me and often would get a group lunch together with the other Directors and NEVER once invited me. I confronted him on it but to no avail.A few years later I earned a Ph.D. in Business Administration with my dissertation in Human Resource Management. I did this because as an HR Consultant women were considered“less qualified.”The Ph.D. seemed to even the playing field and allowed me the opportunity to write articles for the local Business Journal and other local publications. It allowed me to be a keynote speaker and conference presenter.None of my successes were because I was White. I worked hard and went around barriers created by others to stop my progress. I did not sit around and feel sorry for myself burn buildings protest in the streets or cry foul for every mishap. It became clear that I needed to work harder than many groups of people in order to succeed. I was willing to do whatever it took to be successful.So I have little sympathy for people who constantly want to play the victim card and whine about why they aren’t successful. They want to blame it on their parents their skin color their gender institutionalized discrimination etc.I grew up never hearing about “white privilege.”The term became popular around 1988and has been misused ever since.I resent being told (by Coca-Cola) to “be less white.”I resent people like Oprah who blame us for our “whiteness.”I embrace what Martin Luther King said many years ago. “I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skinbut by the content of their character.”(From the “I have a dream”speech)This philosophy works for all of us not just those who want to condemn White People. I have never intentionally discriminated against black people or any people of color. I show respect for people in all job types cultural backgrounds ethnic backgrounds religious backgrounds and refuse to apologize for being born White. Remember those of us born White had as much impact on our birth color as those who were born in other shades.It is time to drop the race card and work together as a human family God’s family!
