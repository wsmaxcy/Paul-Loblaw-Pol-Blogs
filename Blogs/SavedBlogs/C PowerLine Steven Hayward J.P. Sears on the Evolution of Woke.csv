C, J.P. Sears on the Evolution of Woke, Steven Hayward, 2021-06-13, J.P. Sears strikes again this time explaining as only he can do the recent evolution of “wokeness” from “the pre-paleowokalithic era” and before the social justice warriors learned “how to make weapons out of keyboards.”  And I note that for the second week in a row Bill Maher took after his fellow progressives for their “progressophobia” (fear of progress) but I’ll skip over posting the video here partly because it is over 9 minutes long and even when Maher is making sense he gets tedious. If you want to take it in you can find it here. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
