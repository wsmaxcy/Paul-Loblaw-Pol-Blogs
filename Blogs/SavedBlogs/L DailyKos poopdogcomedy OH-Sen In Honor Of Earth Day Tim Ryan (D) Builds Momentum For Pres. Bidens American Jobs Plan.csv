L, OH-Sen: In Honor Of Earth Day Tim Ryan (D) Builds Momentum For Pres. Biden's American Jobs Plan, poopdogcomedy, 2021-04-22, Received this e-mail today from potential U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan (D. OH-13): Climate change is an existential crisis and the window is closing for us to do something about it. We feel that impact here in Ohio from the disappearing habitat of the Buckeye Tree to the toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie to our communities living with dirty air and unsafe water. The consequences of inaction are felt not by politicians in Washington but by the communities they let down. That’s why I’ve been fighting for job-creating climate solutions in Congress. I was an original cosponsor of the INVEST in America Act and passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016. Green infrastructure strengthens our economy creates well-paying jobs and a better future for us all. This Earth Day we have another reason to feel hopeful. President Biden’s American Jobs Plan is an essential step toward meeting our climate goals and jump-starting our economy. It will invest nearly a trillion dollars over the next 8 years into cutting greenhouse emissions. But we can’t wait a second longer. If you haven’t already will you sign my petition demanding Congress pass the American Jobs Plan ASAP and take this huge step toward combating climate change? -- Tim Ryan Click here to add your name.
