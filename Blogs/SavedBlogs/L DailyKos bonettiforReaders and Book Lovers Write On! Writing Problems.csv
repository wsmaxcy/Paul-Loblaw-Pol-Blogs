L, Write On! Writing Problems?, bonettiforReaders and Book Lovers, 2021-04-29, Welcome to Write On! April is a NaNoWriMo month specifically Camp NaNoWriMo. I don’t know if anyone here participated. I didn’t for the first time in years. I’ve done every Camp since April 2014 and I was just out of oomph. This week is going to be a little different. Usually the host dispenses some writing advice or delves into a specific aspect of writing. But it’s the fifth Thursday of the month a nicely irregular opportunity for experimentation so I thought we might try something new. I’m going to throw the floor open to our collective wisdom. Got a (writing-related) problem? Ask it! Got a solution? Propose it! If they match up? Even better! (Dad always responded to “I have a question” with “I have an answer let’s see if they match.”) Me? I do have a problem. I think it’s burn out but it might be motivation or enthusiasm. I’ve been writing practically daily for the last couple of years yet have nothing finalized. I’ve got a pile of First Drafts and a (smaller) pile of Almost Second Drafts That Just Need A Little More Work and… ugh. On the bright side I got my jabs and I got a little writing done while waiting. (And while waiting in the car for the spouse to as well on other days.) So maybe taking a little time off was all I needed to recharge except a week after Fauci Ouchie #2 and revising a scene while waiting my fifteen minutes I’ve had a grand total of one morning of productivity. I’m skipping the writing exercise because this is a support group night. How’s the writing going? Or not going? Do you have problems you’re looking for solutions for? Or problems you need to express and be heard regardless of solutions? Or victories you’ve achieved in which case use this space to exult! (I could use some vicarious victoriousness!) The floor’s open. Write On! will be a regular Thursday night diary (8 pm Eastern 5 pm Pacific) until it isn’t.

TIME EST/EDT (LAST SUN OF THE MONTH) 7:30 AM You Can't Read That!    or Paul's Book Reviews
