L, Your proudest *a*typical accomplishment is...., CameronProf, 2021-04-19, I admit it shoot I have admitted it I love me some Pee Wee Herman. If there was not a G-d already he would be G-d.  My bestest friend in the world since 7th grade and still going strong grew up on Pee Wee. With his television show to Pee Wee’s Big Adventure to his stand up career late night appearances etc. there is no one else quiet like Mr. Herman.  I have seen Big Adventure well over 300 times. Whenever my friend Paul and I get together nowadays like every 2 years or so we have to watch the movie at least once. No one will watch it with us. Why? I don’t know!  Ok...Ok...I do know.. We know the movie line by line. In the viewings he does all the Pee Wee lines and I do the other character lines.  We still have debates who the hottest actor was in the movie (For me one of the BMX bikers we meet at Chucks Bike-O-Rama….the one who says “I’m sweatin’”) Don’t forget we say this movie when we were young I was 16 when it first came out.  We each even have our own individual favorite scenes:  His   Mine:  We are so bad (or good) we end up seeing actors from the movie in other movies we call out their name.   So how about you? What is your proudest atypical accomplishment?
