L, Think Matthew McConaughey's gonna be Texas' next governor? Why you should be wary of that poll, Jeff SingerforDaily Kos Elections, 2021-04-20, The Dallas Morning News generated plenty of attention over the weekend when it released a UT Tyler poll showing actor Matthew McConaughey leading Republican Gov. Greg Abbott 45-33 in a hypothetical general election in Texas but there’s a big reason to be skeptical that the Oscar winner would start out with anything like that advantage if he ran. The survey did not include the party affiliation for either man instead simply asking “Matthew McConaughey has been talked about as a potential candidate for Governor of Texas. If he ran would you be likely to support him more than Governor Abbott?” That omission makes it tough to draw any conclusions from this survey especially since the self-described “aggressively centrist” McConaughey has refused to say what party banner if any he’d run under.  If McConaughey campaigns as a Democrat it’s likely that many of the respondents who opt for him now (including the 30% of the Republicans in the sample) simply would no longer consider him as a viable option. And should McConaughey instead campaign as an independent he’d almost certainly face a Democratic opponent who would take many anti-Abbott votes from him. The dynamics of the race would also be dramatically different if McConaughey decided to run in a Republican primary against Abbott. McConaughey himself has talked about running for governor but hasn’t taken any obvious steps towards running so we may never find out how he’d do under any of these scenarios. However there’s still an important lesson to be drawn here about the importance of including party affiliation (or noting the lack of it) in horserace surveys even ones looking at very hypothetical races like this one. As we’ve written before if a pollster doesn't include this then they're leaving out important information and failing to accurately mimic the way voters will make their choices when they actually cast their ballots.
