L, The differences between the Know Nothings of the 1850s and the Trump GOP of the 2020s, HalBrown, 2021-05-09, Wikipedia tells us that: The Know Nothings were a nativist political party and movement in the United States in the mid-1850s. Despite using the "Native American Party" name its membership consisted of the descendants of colonists or settlers and did not include indigenous Native Americans. The Know Nothings were originally a secret society. It was primarily an anti-Catholic Anti-Irish anti-immigration populist and xenophobic movement. It was progressive in its stances on "issues of labor rights opposition to slavery and the need for more government spending"[1] as well as for its "support for an expansion of the rights of women regulation of industry and support of measures designed to improve the status of working people."[2] It was a forerunner to the temperance movement in the United States. The Know Nothing movement briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party. Adherents to the movement were to simply reply "I know nothing" when asked about its specifics by outsiders providing the group with its common name.[3] There are obvious similarities between the Know Nothings and the Trump GOP (TGOP) today. The differences are that in stark contrast to the TGOP they were progressive in significant ways.  One of the major differences however is that the TGOP is anything but secret. It flies its flag proudly and defiantly. It can be symbolized by the raised fist of Josh Hawley. The major difference that I see is that the TGOP is living in a world of unreality or to but it bluntly a world of lies. The leaders of the party embrace people like Marjorie Taylor Greene who may or may not be clinically delusional and Tucker Carlson who knowingly promotes conspiracy theories and dangerous Covid misinformation because this is part of his brand.  The only way to determine what these two actually believe is to polygraph them under truth serum. All the members of the TGOP reside as my illustration depicts in a garbage dump. Some of you are old enough to remember Smell-O-vision (Wikipedia)  ...a system that released odors during the projection of a film so that the viewer could "smell” what was happening in the movie. If we could produce this on the Internet my graphic would have you gagging.
