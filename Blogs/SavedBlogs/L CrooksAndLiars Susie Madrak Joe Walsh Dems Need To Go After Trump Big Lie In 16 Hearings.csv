L, Joe Walsh: Dems Need To Go After Trump Big Lie In 1/6 Hearings, Susie Madrak, 2021-07-08, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  After a segment on how Democrats are strategizing to keep Republicans from turning the 1/6 investigation into a circus CNN's New Day brought on former GOPer Joe Walsh. "What is your reaction to this strategy of Democrats? They're trying to keep it less political. We'll see if they succeed with that" Brianna Keilar said. "I understand what the Democrats are doing and I understand their concerns but my plea to them would be not to be afraid. Look the Republicans want this thing to be a circus. They want this thing to be a spectacle. They want this thing to be a partisan exercise because they don't want the truth. Democrats need to investigate Brianna the 'why.'  "If they really want to know the truth why the heck did January 6th happen? Why? The why -- why were people there trying to overturn an election? Why was there an insurrection? The Democrats shouldn't be afraid Brianna to look into that truth because that truth is that Donald Trump and the Republicans the Big Lie led to the why to why people were there. I think Democrats really need to be unafraid here to pursue the truth" he said. "The problem though as they used to say to me growing up on the farm Joe is the thing is when you wrestle with a pig you both get dirty and the pig likes it. The Republicans as you say they want this to be dirty. So how do the Democrats avoid that while getting the information you say they want?" John Berman said. Walsh said it makes sense to do as much as they can in private because public hearings tend to become spectacles. "I think there's no doubt Kevin McCarthy who I don't think wanted to appoint any Republicans to this committee at all and to just point to it and say it's a political exercise I think he's going to appoint people put people on this committee who are going to try to make it a partisan circus. So I think -- look as much as Democrats can do privately and professionally that's all good and well.  "I understand the politics and I get all of that and this will happen next year in an election year but my God we are six months removed from an attack on our government and none of the current investigations again John are investigating the why. Why did thousands of people go to Washington to attack our government? That truth Democrats can't be afraid to go there because we sort of know where the 'there' is. That's the Big Lie. And that's going to point toward Republicans" he said.
