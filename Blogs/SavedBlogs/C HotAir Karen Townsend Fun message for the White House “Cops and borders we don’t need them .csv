C, Fun message for the White House: “Cops and borders we don’t need them" , Karen Townsend, 2021-05-01, Protesters were arrested while blocking traffic around the White House on Friday. The activists demand that Joe Biden live up to his promises made on the campaign trail and grant amnesty to 11 million illegal aliens immediately. The group of protesters included illegal aliens DACA recipients and their supporters. They reject the “crumbs” offered so far by Biden and other Democrats.  The protesters are anti-cop and pro-open borders. Members of Movimiento Cosecha a national group that fights for amnesty for illegal immigrants used megaphones and led the protesters in chanting. “Cops and borders we don’t need them. All we want is total freedom!” The irony is that illegal aliens felt free enough to come to the White House and protest by blocking traffic there in the first place. In what other country would they be able to behave like this? Immigration laws have not been fully enforced for decades emboldening those who live here outside of legal immigration procedures to feel entitled to do as they wish. They feel entitled to a free pass at the expense of legal immigrants and American taxpayers. To mark Biden’s 100th day in office the open borders activists wanted to let him know they are tired of “crumbs” and demand that Democrats in Congress go it alone if necessary to provide blanket amnesty and not use a piecemeal approach to immigration reform.  “President Biden ended his first 100 days in office with broken promises and insufficient action for my community” Gema Lowe an organizer with Movimiento Cosecha said in a statement criticizing Biden’s pursuit of a “piecemeal” strategy” instead of blanket amnesty — a reference to the Dream and Promise Act specifically. “Biden originally committed to a pathway to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Now he is ready to pursue a ‘piecemeal’ strategy instead that would exclude me and millions of others who have lived in this country for decades” Lowe said. “We deserve better. That is why today I am willing to risk arrest detention and deportation to demand papers not crumbs” Lowe added. Hector Morales another organizer and DACA recipient also proudly asserted he would risk arrest to “tell President Biden that I won’t accept piecemeal bills that exclude and criminalize my own community members.” “I won’t accept these crumbs. We need permanent protection for all” he said. Their arrogance is a palpable absurdity. They are living in the United States illegally and yet they feel entitled to call the shots to make demands of lawmakers and of the president himself. The truly ridiculous part is that Joe Biden will bend over backward to appease them. He already promised to put an end to illegal migrants being held in private detention facilities because of demands by open border activists. “Give me five days” he told protesters in Georgia during a rally on Thursday.  Movimiento Cosecha plans for “thousands of undocumented workers and families” to rally in downtown Washington D.C. for a “Papers Not Crumbs” protest today. Thanks to Joe Biden’s sops to illegal immigrants in past speeches and executive actions we know that they will have little to fear while protesting. They may be arrested if they try to block traffic again but it’s unlikely they will receive more than a slap on the wrist for that. Biden doesn’t want illegal immigrants to be arrested in places that ICE might be able to do so like outside courthouses or ICE raids at factories and other businesses that rely on illegal workers so they certainly will be allowed to carry on with their protests without consequences. They will be allowed the same First Amendment rights as legal citizens.

They demand that Senate Democrats pursue a 51-vote strategy for blanket amnesty. United We Dream is described as the “largest immigrant youth-led network in the country” with 400000 members and engages with over 4000000 supporters online.  “Republican inaction is not an excuse not to deliver” said the group’s national communications manager Jose Muñoz of the 51-vote strategy. United We Dream has in recent weeks held events protesting Republican Senators Marco Rubio in Florida and John Cornyn in Texas demonstrating outside his Houston office. Munoz said the demonstration were held because Republicans are “doubling down on anti-immigrant attacks aimed at the millions of immigrants living here for decades.” “COVID is a perfect example of how the president and Congress recognized they couldn’t give Americans what they needed in terms of COVID relief if they kept waiting for Republicans to come to the table” Muñoz said. The group has launched a digital ad campaign targeting moderate Democratic senators and leadership.  The five-figure campaign will feature young immigrants calling on Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona Colorado’s John Hickenlooper Dick Durbin of Illinois as well as Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Joe Biden to deliver a path to citizenship for Dreamers temporary protected status (TPS) holders and farmworkers. The ads will run on Facebook Youtube and Google Search in the senators’ home states as well as in Washington D.C. They are part of United We Dream’s “Undeniable” video storytelling series which features young Black and Brown immigrants telling their stories and explaining how a path to citizenship would help them and their families. The ads are not described as attack ads by the group.  “The undocumented community has been waiting for a breakthrough for the last 35 years through seven presidents four years of Trump and millions of deportations of our loved ones” Greisa Martinez the executive director of United We Dream told Newsweek. “This is our call for Democrats to be bold and deliver for 11 million people” she said. “It’s not an attack ad it’s ensuring we’re really clear with our champions to know that we have their backs but that the time to deliver is now.” Biden is already caving to their demands. The polling on Biden’s performance on illegal immigration and the southern border crisis is very weak though. A majority of Americans do not support his handling of the crisis at the border. Legal immigrants do not support blanket amnesty or open border policies either. Biden brought this on himself. The border crisis was completely predictable and now those here illegally are ramping up their demands too.
