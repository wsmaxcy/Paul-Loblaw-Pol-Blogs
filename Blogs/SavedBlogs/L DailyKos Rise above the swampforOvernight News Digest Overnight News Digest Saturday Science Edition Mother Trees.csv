His proposition was simple and unsparing: humans when left to their own devices compete with one another for resources until the resources run out. ‘Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush each pursuing his own best interest’ he wrote. ‘Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.’ Hardin’s argument made intuitive sense and provided a temptingly simple explanation for catastrophes of all kinds – traffic jams dirty public toilets species extinction. His essay widely read and accepted would become one of the most-cited scientific papers of all time. Even before Hardin’s ‘The Tragedy of the Commons’ was published however the young political scientist Elinor Ostrom had proven him wrong. While Hardin speculated that the tragedy of the commons could be avoided only through total privatisation or total government control Ostrom had witnessed groundwater users near her native Los Angeles hammer out a system for sharing their coveted resource. Over the next several decades as a professor at Indiana University Bloomington she studied collaborative management systems developed by cattle herders in Switzerland forest dwellers in Japan and irrigators in the Philippines. These communities had found ways of both preserving a shared resource – pasture trees water – and providing their members with a living. Some had been deftly avoiding the tragedy of the commons for centuries; Ostrom was simply one of the first scientists to pay close attention to their traditions and analyse how and why they worked. Scientific American by Richard Schiffman 'Mother Trees' are Intelligent: They Learn and Remember Few researchers have had the pop culture impact of Suzanne Simard. The University of British Columbia ecologist was the model for Patricia Westerford a controversial tree scientist in Richard Powers’s 2019 Pulitzer Prize–winning novel The Overstory. Simard’s work also inspired James Cameron's vision of the godlike “Tree of Souls” in his 2009 box office hit Avatar. And her research was prominently featured in German forester Peter Wohlleben’s 2016 nonfiction bestseller The Hidden Life of Trees. What captured the public’s imagination was Simard’s findings that trees are social beings that exchange nutrients help one another and communicate about insect pests and other environmental threats. Previous ecologists had focused on what happens aboveground but Simard used radioactive isotopes of carbon to trace how trees share resources and information with one another through an intricately interconnected network of mycorrhizal fungi that colonize trees’ roots. In more recent work she has found evidence that trees recognize their own kin and favor them with the lion’s share of their bounty especially when the saplings are most vulnerable.  inverse Scientists Claim They Discovered the 'Gate of Consciousness' THE BRAIN is constantly sorting through an endless barrage of sensory stimuli. In the same five minutes you could be navigating your way through a crush of pedestrians while calling the office picking up your dog’s doo-doo and keeping an eye on that the driver who’s sure to blow through a stop sign. Because we can’t possibly absorb every single stimulus our brain lets some of these signals filter through to our consciousness while others don’t. But where specifically in the brain does that filtering take place? If somewhere in the brain exists the gateway to consciousness which part of the brain functions as the gatekeeper?  Quanta Magazine Researchers Read the Sugary ‘Language' on Cell Surfaces by Rachel Crowell When Pascal Gagneux envisions malaria parasites and other pathogens interacting with the surfaces of a host’s cells he pictures a miniature rainforest with pathogenic particles flying overhead like colorful birds. The canopy consists of branching sugary molecules that adorn the surface of the cell. “If you’re a malaria parasite you’re landing on a human red blood cell” and “the first ‘leaves’ that you touch” are sugars called sialic acids said Gagneux an evolutionary biologist at the University of California San Diego. His ecological view of that interaction is rooted in his previous field work studying wild chimpanzee behavior in the dense West African forests. During those treks he began to ask himself: “Why is it that humans and chimpanzees who share so much of the same DNA don’t deal with diseases the same way?” “Diseases that give you and me the sniffles will actually kill chimpanzees” he explained. But the opposite is also true. Chimps are not susceptible to influenza A and HIV infections turn lethal in humans but stay mild in chimps. The malaria parasites that kill humans can’t infect chimps and vice versa. This odd selectivity is not peculiar to primates — there are countless examples of pathogens devastating certain host species but not others. Seeking an answer Gagneux pivoted to the study of the glycomolecules or glycans in that “rainforest canopy” that shrouds cells. Glycans are a spectacularly diverse group of complex sugars (polysaccharides). They can exist on their own — cellulose is a plant glycan made up of long chains of glucose — or they can be anchored to other biomolecules like proteins and lipids whose chemical properties they modify. Their structure can be linear (as in cellulose) but they can also be very highly branched adding to their variety and complexity. Smithsonian MagazineWhat Caused the Roaring Twenties? Not the End of the Pandemic (Probably)  On the afternoon of November 8 1918 a celebratory conga line wound through a three-mile-long throng on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. From high-rise windows office workers flung makeshift confetti first ticker tape and then when they ran out torn-up paper. They weren’t rejoicing over the close of the influenza pandemic although the city’s death rate had begun to fall. That afternoon New Yorkers let loose for another reason: the end of the Great War.The jubilance proved short-lived. A report from the United Press had prematurely declared an armistice in Europe; in reality it would be a few days more before the war officially ended. “For the moment” reported the New York Times “the whole population of New York was absolutely unrestrained giving way to its emotions without any consideration of anything but the desire to express what it felt.” In that same edition of the Times that detailed the celebration and described fake caskets for Kaiser Wilhelm being hoisted through the streets a smaller headline documented 1061 new cases and 189 deaths from the influenza epidemic still afflicting Americans coast to coast. “About twenty persons applied to the Health Department yesterday personally or by letter to adopt children whose parents have died during the epidemic” the paper read. Just a week earlier over the East River in Queens purpled bodies had piled up in the overflow shed of Cavalry Cemetery enough that the mayor brought in 75 men to bury the accumulated corpses. Together the end of the war and the influenza pandemic closed out a tumultuous decade and introduced a new era with an indelible reputation: the Roaring Twenties. SlateA Man in Italy Got Covid-19. Then His Cancer Went into Remission by Anna GoshuaFollicular lymphoma a cancer of the white blood cells is usually incurable. Patients cycle through periods of therapy that partially shrink their cancers before the disease progresses again. That’s what appeared to be happening with a 61-year-old man in Italy: Diagnosed with cancer in August of 2019 he promptly began a course of chemotherapy completing it in February 2020. All that was left to do was monitor the tumor’s growth. So when a June scan revealed that the patient’s tumor appeared to be growing Martina Sollini a professor of nuclear medicine at Humanitas University in Italy and her colleagues weren’t surprised. Until the biopsy came back negative. Another biopsy and a follow-up scan in September confirmed the original findings: The cancer had gone into complete remission. His medical team was left to figure out how. They turned to a curious explanation: Perhaps the cancer’s sudden remission had something to do with the fact that the patient had that spring been infected with SARS-CoV-2. After ruling out other possibilities they published a case study in February documenting one of a few instances over the course of the pandemic in which researchers suspect that a case of COVID-19 might have caused a tumor to shrink. And while the phenomenon is rare it shows the potential of carefully administered viral therapies to treat cancer in the future.  National Geographic  Wild Horses and Donkeys Dig Wells in the Desert Providing Water for Wildlife Humans have a long history of digging wells but we're not the only species to tap the earth for water: New research reveals wild horses and donkeys also known as burros can as well. As described in a paper published April 29 in the journal Science the animals use their hooves to dig more than six feet deep to reach groundwater for themselves in turn creating oases that serve as a boon to wildlife—American badgers black bears and an array of birds including some declining species such as elf owls. Horses and burros introduced into the wild over the centuries have taken up residence in scattered populations throughout much of the American West. The wells they dig transform into “hotbeds of animal activity” says Erick Lundgren a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and the study’s first author. Neuroscience News Driving Behaviors Harbor Early Signals of Dementia  Columbia University“Based on variables derived from the naturalistic driving data and basic demographic characteristics such as age sex race/ethnicity and education level we could predict mild cognitive impairment and dementia with 88 percent accuracy “said Sharon Di associate professor of civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Columbia Engineering and the study’s lead author. The investigators constructed 29 variables using the naturalistic driving data captured by in-vehicle recording devices from 2977 participants of the Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) project a multisite cohort study sponsored by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. At the time of enrollment the participants were active drivers aged 65-79 years and had no significant cognitive impairment and degenerative medical conditions. Data used in this study spanned the time period from August 2015 through March 2019. Among the 2977 participants whose cars were instrumented with the in-vehicle recording devices 33 were newly diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and 31 percent with dementia by April 2019. Treehugger 24 Brilliant Burrowing Animals with cute (mostly) pictures!by Starre Vartan (Trigger Warning) There are three types of burrowing animals: primary excavators which dig their own burrows (think prairie dogs); secondary modifiers which live inside burrows made by other animals and might modify them to suit their needs; and simple occupants which just occupy abandoned burrows and don't modify them. All of these animals are quite resourceful and have physical characteristics that enable them to live underground and dig to great depths. The following are some of the most interesting animals that use burrows as a home for protection to lay their eggs or for other unexpected purposes. Neuroscience News New Evidence Links Gut Bacteria and Neurodegenerative Conditions University of Florida Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s and ALS affect millions of adults but scientists still do not know what causes these diseases which poses a significant roadblock to developing treatments or preventative measures. Recent research suggests that people with these conditions exhibit changes in the bacterial composition of their digestive tract. However given the vast diversity of microbes found in the human body identifying which bacteria may be associated with neurodegeneration is like finding a needle in a haystack. Seeking that proverbial needle scientists at the University of Florida are looking in an unexpected place: the digestive tract of a tiny translucent worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. New research published in PLOS Pathogens establishes for the first time a link between specific bacteria species and physical manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases. The study’s lead author is Alyssa Walker a microbiology and cell science doctoral candidate in the UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. “Looking at the microbiome is a relatively new approach to investigating what causes neurodegenerative diseases. In this study we were able to show that specific species of bacteria play a role in the development of these conditions” said Daniel Czyz Walker’s dissertation advisor. Science 'It's like the Embers in a Barbecue Pit' Nuclear Reactions are Smoldering again at Chernobyl  by Richard Stone Thirty-five years after the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine exploded in the world’s worst nuclear accident fission reactions are smoldering again in uranium fuel masses buried deep inside a mangled reactor hall. “It’s like the embers in a barbecue pit” says Neil Hyatt a nuclear materials chemist at the University of Sheffield. Now Ukrainian scientists are scrambling to determine whether the reactions will wink out on their own—or require extraordinary interventions to avert another accident. Sensors are tracking a rising number of neutrons a signal of fission streaming from one inaccessible room Anatolii Doroshenko of the Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants (ISPNPP) in Kyiv Ukraine reported last week during discussions about dismantling the reactor. “There are many uncertainties” says ISPNPP’s Maxim Saveliev. “But we can’t rule out the possibility of [an] accident.” The neutron counts are rising slowly Saveliev says suggesting managers still have a few years to figure out how to stifle the threat. Any remedy he and his colleagues come up with will be of keen interest to Japan which is coping with the aftermath of its own nuclear disaster 10 years ago at Fukushima Hyatt notes. “It’s a similar magnitude of hazard.” Salon Processed Foods a Staple of Western Diets Could be Making You Sick by Matthew Rozsa Processed foods are a symbol of the United States known around the world due to the reach of the American culture machine. Oreos chicken nuggets Doritos Chips Ahoy and Pop-Tarts are a staple of American grocery lists. And for good reason: they taste good of course; are readily accessible at grocery stores and convenience stories; and are advertised heavily to American consumers. But while many processed foods add vitamins to give them the appearance of being "healthy" a new study reveals that processed foods have some unexpected negative health effects on one's body. The study examined human gut microbiota — meaning the bacteria fungi and other microorganisms which live in your digestive tract and actually help your body's immune system in fighting pathogens (or dangerous microorganisms).
