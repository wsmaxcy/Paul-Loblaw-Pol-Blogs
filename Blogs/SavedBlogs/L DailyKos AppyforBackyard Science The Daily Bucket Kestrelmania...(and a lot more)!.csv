L, The Daily Bucket: Kestrelmania...(and a lot more)!, AppyforBackyard Science, 2021-04-26,  The Daily Bucket is a nature refuge. We amicably discuss animals weather climate soil plants waters and note life’s patterns. We invite you to note what you are seeing around you in your own part of the world and to share your observations in the comments below. April 2021 Flint Hills Kansas I love all birds but especially the raptors...Golden Eagles Bald Eagles Owls and Kestrels. I also love Kingfishers Swallows and water fowl. It is really hard for me to rank any raptor above the Kestrels in terms of natural beauty. The Kestrel also ranks in my top two as most difficult to capture great photos of while in flight. Of course they are beautiful whether they are in flight or perched.    This above pic is one I barely salvaged. I was looking through my uploaded images for that day and wondered why in the world I had taken that shot...perhaps an accidental click? Just as I was getting ready to click the delete button I happened to notice a small figure right center of the screen. I clicked on zoom several times before deciding to edit and create. When finished the image above resulted. It is severely cropped to what I feel is optimum view. This might be the second favorite of my Kestrel photos...up to now! My schedule has been full to the hilt lately. The saving grace is that I have a trip up the Wagon Trail in the morning and a return trip down it in the late afternoon or early evening. Even during the burn season or on  rainy days it is seldom the Wagon Trail fails to deliver a good photo opportunity. The trick is to be ready to take advantage! During the past couple of weeks I have taken more photos than I ever had in a similar time frame. They aren’t all raptors either. Lets take a Kestrel break to look at some of the other things I’ve been seeing along the way.   Yesterday (4/21) I got a little extra excited when I took a peek at the photos on my memory card. I noticed one of the subjects was sporting a band on it’s leg.  After my big burn day shoot I noticed more Swainson’s Hawks during my trips. Differences were visible while processing the camera uploads. I’m learning these hawks are more curious than I’m accustomed to. You have to be quick to catch prairie Red Tails and Kestrels before they bolt the area. But the Swainson’s tend to be somewhat inclined to check you out. That’s just what the doctor ordered for great BIF photo opportunities. I think I’ve accumulated about 60 keeper Swainson’s photos over the past few weeks. They have enhanced my life and certainly my photo file album. But just to be clear Swainson’s are not the only hawks I’ve seen. In between trips on the Trail I’m at home. There is ALWAYS something interesting happening at home. If not watching birds at my feeders or doing chores in the barn there is always the pond to check out as I go by to feed at the upper barn. There has been a lot happening at my pond lately. I had been waiting and watching all fall and through the winter for a chance to photo ducks and geese visiting. That didn’t happen until a few days ago.  Edit: 4/23 there were 5 ducks and an egret on the pond this morning but they all vacated when the dogs and I walked by toward the upper barn.   A walk down along the river showed some interesting things.   Back on the Wagon Trail things are still happening.   Not all land birds stick to the water. What a rough road! Let’s get back to aerial mode. This diary is getting too longwinded so here comes the finish. I have some NEW Kestrel picks taken 4/22 that IMO take the top four spots for my best ever. See if you agree with my pick for top choice.   Now for my choice of my best Kestrel photo ever. I can’t get tired of admiring this spectacular bird. Is this the best I can do? Time will tell. I expect to take a lot more trips along the Wagon Trail. Today’s game is to name the bug/s! That’s what ZOOM (Thanks Jeff!) is for. LOL.
