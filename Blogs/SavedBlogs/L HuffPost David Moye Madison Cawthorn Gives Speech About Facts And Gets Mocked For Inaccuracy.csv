L, Madison Cawthorn Gives Speech About Facts And Gets Mocked For Inaccuracy, David Moye, 2021-06-24, Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) attempted to school his fellow representatives on the importance of facts Thursday ― but ended up getting mocked because he got one of his most important facts wrong. It happened during a speech Cawthorn was giving while the House was discussing whether to repeal the Trump administration’s “true lender” rule via the Congressional Review Act. The freshman congressman attempted to sound like a statesman by quoting one of the Founding Fathers. “It was Thomas Jefferson that said ‘Facts are stubborn things and whatever may be our wishes our inclinations or the dictates of our passions they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.’ Let’s cast our eyes over the facts shall we” he said. Cawthorn: It was Thomas Jefferson that said facts are stubborn things… pic.twitter.com/LokKpvmxij Problem is Cawthorn got his facts wrong: That quote comes courtesy of John Adams not Jefferson. It’s not like Cawthorn is a historian: The Asheville Citizen-Times noted last August that he attended one semester of college and earned mostly Ds. HuffPost reached out to Cawthorn for comment on his factual fail but he did not immediately respond. However Cawthorn has a history of making false claims including seeming to take credit for a relief bill that he voted against lying about the car crash that paralyzed him and making fact-free claims of election fraud only to admit when pushed that the 2020 election was not conducted fraudulently. That’s why many Twitter users felt it their duty to school the 25-year-old congressman on the importance of having all your facts straight when you’re speaking about facts.  Thomas Jefferson didn't say that. But as they say facts are stubborn things. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://t.co/bi4Qyxwc46 That wasn’t Thomas Jefferson it was John Adams. What an ignorant posturing jackweasel. https://t.co/7Yx4LwEW5t It's a fact that John Adams said that.It's a fact that Cawthorn doesn't factcheck. pic.twitter.com/BxMC8cl2jE Never underestimate the inappropriate confidence of a right wing nut. Facts are stubborn things: but he can't even get the attribution right so why make this his hill to die on. https://t.co/X9tzmrx7Yn Jefferson didn't say that but I believe he said: "We hold these truths to be self-evident that men who grope women boast about seeing Hitler's vacation home incite insurrectionists & beat up trees are tools." https://t.co/ha6s2YJfIC
