L, MO-Sen: Lucas Kunce (D) Turns Up The Pressure On The Senate To Pass The PRO Act, poopdogcomedy, 2021-05-01, Received this e-mail today from Marine Veteran Lucas Kunce’s (D. MO) U.S. Senate campaign: President Biden labor activists and everyday workers across the country are all calling on the U.S. Senate to pass the PRO (Protecting the Right to Organize) Act. They’re absolutely right we need this bill to get passed — and in a moment I’m going to ask you to sign on as a supporter of the PRO Act. Give me a moment to explain why. During the pandemic Amazon has made more than $14 billion in profits. One report even found CEO Jeff Bezos had acquired enough new wealth during the first 7 months of the pandemic that could have given every single one of Amazon’s employees a bonus of $105000 and he’d still be as rich as he was pre-pandemic. Instead Amazon decided to end hazard pay for its workers and spent millions of dollars trying to silence workers in Bessemer who wanted a union so they could bargain for a better workplace. The National Labor Relations Board even found evidence of Amazon’s actions “could be grounds for overturning” the union election. The PRO Act would hold union-busting companies like Amazon accountable — a key reason why I hope you’ll add your name to support it today — but this isn’t just about Amazon or Bessemer. This is about workers everywhere. Over the last 40 years career politicians have allowed a handful of massive corporations to dominate our economy write their own rules and rig the system against working people. We desperately need to give everyday people the power to fight back and bargain for a better workplace. That’s where the PRO Act comes in. This legislation would give power back to workers. It’d make companies like Amazon pay a real price for union-busting. And it’d block so-called “Right to Work” laws forever. President Biden made it clear he’ll sign the PRO Act into law. It’s passed in the House. Now it’s up to the Senate. We need to make ourselves loud and clear on this — that’s why I’m asking you to add your name next to mine. Will you sign our petition calling on the Senate to pass the PRO Act now? Thank you for taking action Lucas Kunce Click here to add your name.
