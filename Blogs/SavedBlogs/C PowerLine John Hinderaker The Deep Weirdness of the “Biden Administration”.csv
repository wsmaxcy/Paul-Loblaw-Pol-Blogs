C, The Deep Weirdness of the “Biden Administration”, John Hinderaker, 2021-05-05, On Monday Joe and Jill Biden paid a visit to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter in Georgia. The visit resulted in this photograph which has spurred a lot of comment on social media: We’re pleased to share this wonderful photo from the @POTUS and @FLOTUS visit to see the Carters in Plains Ga.!  Thank you President and Mrs. Biden! pic.twitter.com/QcA33iUev4 — The Carter Center (@CarterCenter) May 4 2021  
What on Earth is going on here? The Carters look tiny while Joe Biden himself elderly and frail looks like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Some speculate that it is an artifact of the camera lens but I don’t see how that can account for it. Also note the absence of masks. Biden wears one to participate by himself in a zoom call or when he is walking outdoors. Maybe this is the photo-op exception to the mask rule. Contrast the way Biden looks in that photo with his more usual feeble appearance and halting manner as manifested pretty much every time he speaks in public. As with this video also getting play on social media: WARNING: Don’t go to vaccines.cum if you’re at work. https://t.co/Yox3qZsruM — Dave Rubin (@RubinReport) May 4 2021  
These are pretty grim days but one source of entertainment is observing the liberal press studiously pretending not to notice the utter bizarreness of the “Biden administration.” Our president looks as Scott says like an escapee from Madame Tussaud’s and he sounds even worse. But America’s intrepid reporters are determined to pretend that all is well. For them it will be a long year or two years or however long Biden is able to remain vertical. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
