L, I Think Kevin McCarthy is a Robot Specifically Programmed to Execute Leadership Tasks Poorly, ShowerCap, 2021-07-02, Things’re gettin’ pretty good these days huh? Seems Joe Biden came here to create jobs and eat ice cream and neither appear to be in short supply. Of course the Gulf of Mexico is literally on fire as I write this a grim reminder that you can’t take your eyes off the bastards for even a minute. Fortunately I happen to be in the chronicling business. (As always this one sprang to life on Cappie’s blog site: showercapblog.com/...)  After months spent licking his wounds down at Marm-a-Lago the Deposed Dotard has grown ravenous for attention but it turns out that particular currency ain’t easy to come by for a has-been Hitler a toppled autocrat feebly wheezing his way through a tired litany of worn-out grievances like some decrepit fashy Vanilla Ice (who to his credit at least wore ill-fitting pants on purpose.) shuffling along the casino circuit.  Not even Fux Nooz carries these pathetic Old Nazi Yells at Cloud rallies anymore which I think is a shame actually; we should shine the brightest possible spotlight on this visibly-declining dolt as he continues to boast about the cognitive test he once “aced” as though he’d knocked out Mike Tyson. “You’ve just successfully identified a drawing of a horsey what’s next?” “Well I’m going to Disney World where I’ll be swiftly ejected for groping some poor college kid in a Minnie Mouse costume!”  The news that Arizona Republicans stripped their Secretary of State’s office of much of its power but only for the duration of the current (Democratic) officeholder’s term barely made a ripple because we’ve all normalized the idea that the GOP is an autocratic gang that simply will not allow voters to select alternate leadership so long as there’s any shred of power available to them to abuse. Healthy that.  As a lifelong Cubs fan I’m usually sympathetic to hopeless endeavors but watching William Barr attempt to rehabilitate his image really hits that sweet spot where futility and atrocity intersect doesn’t it? Billy Boy you looked upon a gaggle of bumbling fascist criminals and said “Oh man I have so many helpful suggestions to improve both the fascism AND the criming” which was pretty fucked up of you. Count your blessings because in a just world you’d be in prison. As for your legacy well if I were you I’d invest in botanical genetic engineering; maybe you could finance the development of some sort of flower that thrives on human piss. You know for your grave.  Sonny Perdue seldom made headlines during his tenure as the Turd Reich’s Minister of Agriculture but I can’t imagine anyone’s surprised to learn he was just as corrupt as the showier thugs n’ looters in Pumpkin Spice Pol Pot’s Cabinet; the Pompeos and the Zinkes the profiteers and lotioneers. Still Sonny’s multi-million dollar grift is a little too complex for a Tweet or a sound bite so maybe we can squeeze it in between the crossword and the latest Marmaduke?  The coronavirus Delta variant continues to surge but not hard enough for Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson who once again opened his fool mouth so a fresh batch of anti-science turds could dribble out. In a caucus filled with theocrats megalomaniacs and whatever unnamable hybrid monstrosity Rand Paul is RoJo manages to stand out for pure primal idiot disdain for human life.  Paul Gosar the official dentist of White Rage has grown so brazen that he’s now openly fundraising with Holocaust-denying white nationalist troll Nick Fuentes and the list of elected Republicans who have condemned this absolutely ghastly move compared with the list of those who haven’t said a single fucking word is…instructive don’tcha think? Anyway I guess the Overton window now encompasses the outhouse behind the northwest Arizona meth lab named after Nathan Bedford Forrest in which Gosar owns a majority stake. Kid Kompromat fancies himself a kingmaker and his latest protégé appears to be former football star and would-be Georgia Senator Herschel Walker whose history of domestic abuse would be disqualifying in any political party that hadn’t been hijacked by a psychopathic death cult and once upon a time that probably felt like a fairly major limitation but then in recent years I’ve watched quite a few ships I believed to be securely anchored set sail.  There’s no drug quite so addictive to Republican officials as the whiff of MAGA celebrity and no more desperate junkie for it than South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem whose latest act of Holy Heck Didn’t You Read Macbeth in School ambition-crazed insanity has been to allow a right-wing billionaire to rent her state’s National Guard troops out as his own toy mercenary force to deploy to the Texas border in an effort to remind Cult45 how much they hate and fear foreigners.  Condolences to the denizens of Hell who now have to put up with Donald Rumsfeld driving their property values down.  Well Nancy Pelosi named her 8 members to the January 6th select committee including Republican Liz Cheney which felt like a momentous act of bipartisanship in this sharply divided era until you remembered the official GOP position is The Terrorists Were Right Actually Which is Why the Moment They Were Cleared From the Capitol We Voted To Give In To Their Demands. Minority Leader McCarthy actually threatened to strip any member of his caucus who accepted Pelosi’s offer to serve of their committee assignments a step he opposed in the case of Marjorie Taylor Greene and lacks the spine/decency to even suggest when it comes to  Paul “please RSVP to my Nazi clambake” Gosar.  Keville Chamberlain may not be interested in investigating the attempted terrorist overthrow of the United States government but when a white nationalist television personality decides to fabricate an NSA spying scandal out of thin air and fish sticks well the man widely expected to become Speaker of the House in the near future automatically implores “How high would you like me to jump Mr. Carlson sir?”  So a despicable propagandist so widely recognized as a liar that his own lawyers argued in court that only the mouthbreathingest of morons fall for his drivel can make the most powerful elected Republican in the country dance like a puppet on a string without producing one iota of evidence? Neat system. Anyhoo don’t worry America; Devin “Pigfucker” Nunes is on the case! (Or at least he will be once he pulls out of Farmer Howlett’s prized Berkshire.)  Now you might think a political party that finds itself aligning with brownshirts and fundraising alongside Holocaust deniers would exhibit a tiny bit of humility particularly where the iconography of Nazism is concerned…well tell that to the Star of David on Washington State Representative Jim Walsh’s chest. Like all white conservative men Walsh is the Real Victim Here™️ folks and if only there were some dumbfuck version of Oskar Schindler available to deliver him from the tyranny of…vaccines.  And just in case you were hoping Jimbo was the only elected Republican comparing medical professionals to Nazis this week for the high crime of (checks notes) trying to stop the spread of a disease that’s claimed 602000 American lives to date…ha ha NO. The 6-3 wingnut Supreme Court issued the latest in their signature series of Silly Electorate Voting is for White Folksrulings because every Republican no matter how powerful is simply one more loyal foot soldier in the fight to institutionalize white supremacy. With so many Americans struggling in pursuit of goals significantly less shitty than “reversing hard-won civil rights gains” I just think it sucks that John Roberts’ pursuit of his deplorable life’s work has proven so fruitful. Why couldn’t he have dreamt of becoming a concert trombonist or some shit?  To all those third party 2016 voters who strutted around the internet telling anyone who’d listen that Hillary didn’t “earn” their vote my sincere congratulations on the state of American democracy (barely clinging to life tubes running in and out of every orifice pissing in a pan while authoritarians point and laugh); you earned it. For all of us. Thanks ever so much.  Well the Shitweasel Organization and its CFO Allen Weisselberg got a fancy gift basket from Manhattan DA Cy Vance containing exotic soaps summer sausages and oh yeah a bunch of felony charges ranging from tax fraud to grand larceny. Now we’ve all been let down by too many visions of imminent Trumpal comeuppance to break out the champagne and party hats just yet but I don’t think anyone could fault us for indulging in the odd think piece or Twitter thread exploring the worst case scenarios for these fucks. Say look who’s pallin’ around with a terrorist it’s a BUNCH OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS! Seems when Anthony Aguero isn’t shuttling the House Racist Dipshit Caucus (Boebert Cawthorn Dr. Ronny Jackson…the usual skidmarks) around the border he participates in a wide range of hobbies including racist internet rants joining insurrectionist lynch mobs and as is so often the case with these creeps domestic violence.  Noted sex pest/Trump stooge Jason Miller launched the latest sad blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cultists-only social media platform but devotees of QAnon are already quite (hot and?) bothered by all the hentai and pictures of diaper-clad old men apparently. This story left me reflecting upon happier times when I wouldn’t have been able to understand the preceding sentence.  If there’s a threshold at which stories about Oath Keepers getting arrested n’ pleading guilty n’ flipping on one another in the Capitol Riot case stops being hilarious/awesome I can safely report we haven’t reached it yet. I suggest continuing the experiment.
