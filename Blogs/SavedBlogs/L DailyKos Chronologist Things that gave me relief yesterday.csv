L, Things that gave me relief yesterday, Chronologist, 2021-04-21, Normally I am the person who will tell you what’s wrong with life readily and gladly.  Especially about America a country I have very little respect for for a great many reasons.  Quite bluntly I make pessimists look optimistic always certain (and usually correct) that disaster looms right around the corner.  In my experience with a pair of bi-polar relatives as my only immediate family any sign of happiness always swiftly turns into mania.  In other words positive events are really just warnings of upcoming negative ones because when you feel great you stop watching the signs and disaster strikes with a total vengeance.   Yesterday however a few things happened that gave me a little relief from the constant gloom.  I’d celebrate with something other than the rare treat of Texas toast and feel really good but I can’t allow that.  It would only lead to disaster tomorrow.   Thing one that’s been a relief to me is that I got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  I’ve already survived Covid last summer.  Mind you I masked up when it was possible (there was a run in Idaho early on so the best I could do for a couple of months was to mutilate a washcloth and use that until a store started to get a small amount of masks in stock.  I was able to get a mask then using the washcloth still to keep that mask off my actual face as I’m tactile-defensive like most autistics.  (That means most fabrics feel uncomfortable almost like fire to the flesh as where the washcloth mask did not).  Then thanks to a link from some friends on a Jaws sequel fan facebook group I was able to purchase as a birthday present to myself a nice Jaws mask in a material I can tolerate.  Now I feel like Bruce is protecting me as I wear him every time I’m indoors except at home.        I was masking and somewhat social-distancing.  Not 24/7 but certainly indoors.  And all of a sudden no one thought my tendency to carry Wet Ones everywhere was strange anymore.  (One of the lessons I learned when I was homeless in Portland was that you don’t know who used a toilet before you did.  Therefore as a precaution if you sit on a public toilet wipe it off with a Wet One first.  They’re meant to counteract human waste; literally that’s what they’re made for.       Anyway all my defenses were for nothing because my roommate at the time and his girlfriend brought the disease right into the house and I wound up catching it.  Twenty-somethings and their sickening sense of invincibility.        Catching Covid was terrifying and I thought I would die from it because I’m a diabetic who is fat and plans to stay that way.  It turns away men who only want sex.  Strangely my case was mild and all it did was drain me of all energy so that even a walk of two blocks can be exhausting to me now when I used to be known for walking all over town and leave me with an unstoppable paralyzing and nauseating cough that still hasn’t gone away yet and probably never will.  I consider myself bloody lucky that’s all it did.  But I knew that catching the disease the second-time around is far more serious.  I had no intention of catching it a second time.        Then the vaccines came out.  Idaho a dreadful place that wilderness should just reclaim and drive the humans entirely out of resisted even bothering with the vaccines.  You already know about this state’s mask-burning party and the kind of morons it elects.  But over time it began to acknowledge that certain people needed vaccines.        Three weeks ago under the prompting of intuition and I personally suspect the goddess I worship I went into Walgreens to ask if my diabetes put me in a high-risk category only to learn that it didn’t matter.  There was a sign up offering vaccine to anyone who asked.  They had opened some vaccine doses and had cancellations meaning use it or lose it.  And I chose to use it reasoning that it was better than being afraid of catching the disease a second time.  Certainly it was aces over worrying about the mutations.        Now we get to it.  For the last two days I’d been discussing vaccination online and with some pharmacy staff at Albertsons.  Then yesterday I was talking to my mother about vaccines to which she’s opposed but she understands my need for shelter because I am a diabetic.  Normally when something really becomes intense for me that’s a sign that something is about to happen involving it.  And that pattern held true.  Walgreens called me and told me that even though it was a day early for taking my second dose that they had open doses available if I wanted one.       So today I got my second dose of Pfizer.  And that does bring relief.  It means I can feel comfortable in restaurants again at least the ones that are open.  Plus it means I can go to the Boise Zoo which is the closest I can get to taking a vacation.  Basically I can now start living some kind of a life without fear instead of staying only with basically four places that became the core of my life in the lost year.  I have the card to prove it.         The card also brings me relief.  It’s like a golden key to places.  Not that I’ve used it for that but for what it represents.  It is my intention to move out of Idaho as soon as I find another state with apartments that cost no more than 500 dollars a month and have great public transportation.  This card means I have something to show landlords when they ask about me leaving a high-virus state.        If you have money which I don’t one can use that card to travel safely.  Portland for instance is likely to be more welcoming if you have that card than it would be to anti-maskers.  Why this card even makes my backup desire possible if I could gain enough money.  What is that desire you ask?  Simple.  I wish to go to Sea World.  With this card in my hand were I to abandon my desire to move that would be possible now.  I wouldn’t have to be worried about catching the virus or rather I wouldn’t have to worry about it being mortal and the card will probably work wonders to deflect questions should I travel anywhere.  (In much the same way that the homeless learn fast that receipts make great deflector shields when you’re in a store or supermarket.  They can’t accuse you of stealing Diet Dr. Pepper if you can prove that you bought it with food stamps from another store and you’re only here to use the bathroom).         I’m also relieved over the trial of George Floyd’s murderer coming to a just conclusion.  Don’t misunderstand.  This is not the beginning of redemption for this country.  Its sins are long-unforgivable at this point.  Nor is this likely the start of police reform.  You can hope so.  I learned a long time ago that hope is one of the cruelest delusions one can ever fall for.  But still I am relieved about the verdict because I was terrified that the anger should that killer be acquitted would bubble over into moderate incidents which would then be used by the reich-wingers to go out and start cracking down and smashing skulls again.  How disgusting.        His acquittal would’ve been a slap in the face to an African-American community that’s already been through a living nightmare in the past twelve months alone.        Though it’s also minor I’m relieved that Judge Chase resigned from her office for her abusive conduct.        And not so minor I’m relieved that a few of those Loud Boys had their bail revoked.  Jail.  It’s not just for blacks and homeless people after all.        I’m relieved that I was finally able to tell people on another website exactly what I think really.  I couldn’t do that here because no one would agree and this site is about electing more and better Democrats.  What I wish would happen would make the whole concept irrelevant so I won’t bring it up here.        Lastly I’m relieved that the U. S. has a president who makes statements but isn’t verbally throwing bombs with his statements.  They’re not meant to harm.        And though she isn’t giving me relief exactly I say four cheers for Maxine Waters.  So often she’s the only person who has the guts to say what has to be said.
