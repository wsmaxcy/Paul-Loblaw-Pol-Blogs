C, The Editorial Board of The Philadelphia Inquirer Asked for "Radical New Thinking" and "Radical Realism", Dana Pico, 2020-11-23, I’m guessing that they won’t like my “radical new thinking” and “radical realism”! About fifteen years ago I worked for a ready-mixed concrete company in suburbs of Philadelphia and one of my responsibilities was driver recruitment. The biggest problem? More than half of potential recruits couldn’t pass the drug test! The greatest anti-poverty program is a job and a huge percentage of those in poverty in Philadelphia have made themselves ineligible for decent jobs through their own choices to use drugs. Reducing poverty cannot come from the top down from boards and commissions and charities. It must come from the bottom up from a community which refuses to use drugs and will not tolerate those who sell drugs. I know I know it’s just horribly politically incorrect to say this but poor people are poor primarily due to their own choices. The Inquirer Editorial Board | November 22 2020 | 6:00 AM EST One of the great challenges of living in a city with the high poverty rate that has long dogged Philadelphia is how to remain optimistic that the proposals designed to alleviate it can work. The past few decades have seen many attempts to “solve” the poverty problem both nationally and locally. Mayor John Street launched a $300 million anti-blight program called the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative. In 2013 Mayor Michael Nutter launched the Shared Prosperity program designed to streamline and maximize available aid to people. Both had their successes but change in the poverty rate was incremental. The latest effort a “Poverty Action Plan” was released in early March from City Council and a committee including Darrell Clarke Maria Quiñones Sanchez and Allan Domb. Last week Council announced the creation of a new nonprofit to implement the plan funded with a $10 million grant from the city. The plan originally described as a “moonshot” designed to lift 100000 people out of poverty by 2024 offers a set of sweeping actions: seven strategies that range from providing a basic income to individuals and wage tax refunds to adult education and job training stipends. It creates a Poverty Commission described as a public-private partnership including city and state government philanthropies universities and civic institutions like the United Way. In addition to a fund it creates a dashboard to measure progress. The commission also assembled a staggering number of people: five co-chairs 19 full committee members and 57 additional people spread over three separate committees. So 81 people probably none of them truly poor themselves involving government employees philanthropies universities and civic institutions. Philadelphia is going to have yet another anti-poverty program put together and run by the elites most and possibly all of whom have never been poor have never to use the expression of Robert E Howard had their lives nailed to their spines trying to put together a program for people who are not like them. Many are familiar names who have been at the front lines of fighting poverty for years if not decades. While it will take a large all-hands-on-deck effort to make inroads it is of concern that especially in this town many people means many politics and many often-conflicting agendas. And the last eight months have complicated things further since many organizations will be fighting for their own survival. Translation: the same people who have “been at the front lines of fighting poverty for years if not decades” and failed will be at it again. Is there any reason to expect different results? Part of leadership is setting goals that are slightly out of reach. But leadership must also recognize that there needs to be a possibility of success especially confronting complicated problems like poverty. Lifting 100000 people out of poverty will take vision and optimism. But it will also take a lot more than $10 million – and a lot longer than four years. Solving this crisis requires a capacity for radical new thinking as well as radical realism. “Radical new thinking as well as radical realism”? I can provide the Inquirer Editorial Board with that but I’m pretty sure that they wouldn’t like it. But perhaps just perhaps some actual plainspokenness is needed here. There are three things which have to be done to reduce poverty in Philadelphia and they need to come from within the poorer primarily black communities. There are many other behaviors that only people in the neighborhoods can fix only the individuals involved can change but they are all part of the three points made above. The various ‘civic leaders’ the Editorial Board mentioned can stress these things but only the people on the ground in their neighborhoods can actually change behavior. Readers can denounce me as sexist or racist or whateverist but it doesn’t matter to me; I am retired living out in the country and I can’t be fired for writing something some people will find uncomfortable. Because uncomfortable or not the points I have made are true and any rational examination of the facts will bring the reader to the same conclusions. This is the “radical new thinking” and “radical realism” the Inquirer’s Editorial Board wanted. That it is not #woke nor sufficiently sparing of the feelings of some that it is horribly politically incorrect does not mean it should not be examined for whether it is true or not. That it puts much of the blame for poverty on the behavior of the poor will be seen as unjustifiably harsh but harsh or not it is still true. Poor behavior leads to unfortunate consequences consequences which are often far beyond what people would like to believe. No well-intentioned committee of 81 committed fighters against poverty no brilliant Mayor of perfectly good motivations and no priest nobly absolving parishioners of their confessed sins can change the consequences of poor and economically inefficient behavior. The solution to poverty can be encouraged by all of those people but the implementation of the solution has to come from the people in poor communities themselves.
