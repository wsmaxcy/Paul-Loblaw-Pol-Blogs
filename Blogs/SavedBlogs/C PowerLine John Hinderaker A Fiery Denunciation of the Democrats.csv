C, A Fiery Denunciation of the Democrats, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-24, I feel like I often denounce the Democrats in pretty fiery terms but David Horowitz’s standard is hard to match. If you think the January 6 mini-riot which the Democrats are now using to justify their many abuses of power is if not fake news certainly grossly exaggerated news you are right. And David spells it out in his patented fashion. This essay is on Front Page and I am taking the liberty of reproducing it here. The Fascist Democrats & the Fake Insurrection In less than a month in office the Biden administration has clearly defined itself and its party as a fascist vanguard driven by a racist agenda and unconstrained by constitutional principle. It chooses to rule by presidential diktat even though it controls both Houses of Congress. It is an aggressive pursuer of political division behind a deceptive smokescreen of “healing” and “unity” It is busily exploiting a fake “armed insurrection” to justify witch-hunts of the military the capital police members of Congress and the opposition media at the moment Fox and Newsmax whom they want to suppress. Its legislative radicals have called for the expulsion of half the Republican conference without rebuke from their leaders. Because these actions are indefensible in a democracy the Democrat Party is brazenly advancing these destructive anti-democratic measures using Orwellian doublespeak. Thus Merrick Garland Biden’s nominee to be the chief law enforcement officer of the land has claimed under oath that terrorist acts can only be committed in the daytime – a transparent move to protect the domestic terrorists of the left who laid siege to 220 American cities at night last summer showing utter contempt for authority and law while attacking federal buildings and local police offices along the way. In other words the fake insurrection in the Capitol – an event conducted mainly by Trump supporters in which only Trump supporters died – is an act of domestic terrorism because it took place in the daytime. But violent armed insurrections and attacks on federal buildings conducted by leftists at night cannot be regarded as terrorist events. How can Americans expect blind justice from a sophist like this? The nauseating sophistry has an obvious bottom line. Only violent protests by Trump supporters can justify the political witch-hunts and purges the Democrats are currently conducting against all conservatives and Republicans. The so-called “armed insurrection” in the Capitol on January 6 was used to impeach Trump? It was allegedly so dangerous as to justify impeaching him after he left office? But it deserves to be called a “fake armed insurrection” because there were no firearms present and no plausible plan to overthrow the government. The malicious fantasy that this effort was an armed attempt to overthrow the government is just that: a malicious fantasy. Four people died at the event – all unarmed. The one who didn’t die of a heart attack stroke or medical emergency Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt was murdered by a Capitol police officer – with no consequences to the officer. The Capitol police officer who died – Brian Suknick and was laid in state and honored by Democrats as a defender of their faith died of indeterminate causes the day after the melee and was a Trump supporter. The January 6 mob scene according to investigators was planned by “Oath Keepers” – a fringe pro-Trump group – two months before Trump gave the speech for which he was impeached under the bogus charge that he had “incited an insurrection.” In fact he had offered to deploy 10000 National Guardsmen to defend the Capitol for the January 6 certification. Some insurrectionist! Trump’s infamous speech was perfectly normal law-abiding and democratic. It was given a mile from the Capitol and was an appeal to his supporters to stiffen the spines of Republican members of Congress so they would challenge the election result. This was something Democrats and their impeachment leader – the devious Jamie Raskin – had done at the certification hearings in 2017 after Trump’s election (and also in 2001 and 2005 after both Bush elections). Democrats’ hypocrisy apparently knows no limits and no restraints and evidently has no decency filter. If Trump’s supporters failed to stiffen the spines of “weak Republicans” as Trump urged them to do in so many words at the Ellipse they needed to go back home and primary them in the 2022 elections. Totally respectful of the democratic process. The reality is that given the three months of violent assaults by Black Lives Matter and Antifa criminals on 220 American cities last summer January 6 was an unexceptional event. Where was the respect for government courthouses national monuments police stations and public order all summer? For three months and more those violent insurrectionary riots were supported by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrat Party leadership and even funded by them. Thanks to the Democrats violent attacks on people and property and government buildings had become a “cultural norm” – to use Biden’s unconscionable phrase for looking away when confronted by Chinese genocide and enslavement of 2 million Uighur Muslims. Yet with the help of cowardly Republicans afraid to call these aggressions by their proper names the Democrats were able to turn the Capitol melee into a preposterous Reichstag Fire – the same that provided Hitler the elected chancellor of the Weimar Republic with an excuse for destroying the Republic and silencing his opponents. The difference was that for Hitler the phantom enemy that justified his depredations was the Jews while for the fascist Democrats it is “white supremacists” whose actual numbers are fewer even than the Jews. The Marxists of Black Lives Matter are the actual authors of the lie that the January 6 melee in the capital was a “white supremacist coup.” But even the pathetic Merrick Garland was forced to repeat the canard – without offering a shred of evidence – at his confirmation hearing. That’s how pervasive this racist ideology has become in shaping the Democrat Party’s drive to destroy our constitutional Republic. The hour is actually late and Americans better wake up and start fighting for their country or there will soon be nothing left to defend. Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
