L, Maskhole Reporter Can't Win When Facing Psaki, Aliza Worthington, 2021-05-14, Yet another wingnut reporter to befoul the Press Room tried to trip up Jen Psaki with a question about the CDC's mask guidelines by implying President Biden wasn't setting a good example for the country. She pointed to the meeting Pres. Biden held in the Oval Office with the four top leaders in Congress the day before in which they all wore masks indoors despite being vaccinated. "CDC guidance says vaccinated Americans can gather in small groups inside without masks. So why aren't we seeing the president model more of that behavior?" she asked Psaki thinking she'd ensnared her in the ultimate "GOTCHYA." Eyeroll. Psaki replied "They were wearing masks I can confirm that you all saw that in photos. I know this has ruffled the feathers of the RNC I always feel bad about ruffling their feathers." Nothing like sarcasm before the deathblow.  "But I will say that the focus on the meeting was seeing if there was a way to move together to work toward shared objectives of investing in infrastructure. Creating jobs for the American people. And I think that's what most people's focus is on" Psaki explained.  Because why given all that is happening in this nation and around the world can conservatives not focus on anything but mask-wearing? I know filling plastic bags with gasoline is running a close second for taking up room in their tiny squirrel brains but seriously this trolling is so tiresome. Nevertheless the reporter insisted upon pursuing her point. "But the argument has been that if you can take your mask off it would incentivize others to get vaccinated right to be able to participate in some of the benefits of being vaccinated. But yet we aren't really seeing the president sort of lead by example." Since clearly the "journalist" wasn't swayed by what should be her priorities perhaps a fact or two might help. (I know. I'm dreaming.) Psaki offered up the facts anyhow. "The president doesn't wear his mask when he's outside that guidance is clear. There were a number of people in the Oval Office yesterday. Obviously there was a whole press pool."  THEY WERE WEARING MASKS BECAUSE THE WHOLE PRESS POOL WAS IN THERE YOU MORON. "But again I think the big takeaway from the meeting yesterday I think what most people look at it and take away is that the president sat there with Democrats and Republicans they all came out of the meeting saying it was constructive looking to see what the path forward could be about how we can create jobs and rebuild roads rails and bridges. And that was what the objective of the meeting was." There's the return to priorities. Bipartisanship uniquely available to Biden somehow. When it's not he'll power on without it. But jobs roads trains and bridges for Americans are what matter. If you maskholes would get the vaccine we'd be free of the masks a lot sooner. The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do.
