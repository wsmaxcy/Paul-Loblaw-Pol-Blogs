C, Catch Me on Fox News Tonight, John Hinderaker, 2021-02-10, I will be on Fox Prime Time tonight with host Mark Steyn with a hit time of 7:10 Eastern. The topic will be impeachment. Please tune in if you can! Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
