Evie Fordham’s current story at FOXBusiness is “Parler sues Amazon for suspending app from cloud service claims antitrust violation and breach of contract.”  Parler chief executive officer John Matze offered much more to support his claim and evidence Amazon’s bad faith in his interview with Maria Bartiromo this morning (video below). Please check it out.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
