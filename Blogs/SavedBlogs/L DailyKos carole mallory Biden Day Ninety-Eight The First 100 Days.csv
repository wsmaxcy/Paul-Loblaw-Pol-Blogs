L, Biden Day Ninety-Eight: The First 100 Days, carole mallory, 2021-04-27, FBI to investigate the shooting of unarmed black man Andrew Brown in the head in Elizabeth N.C.  Shot eight times.  All policemen involved quit.  Police only showed 8 seconds of redacted video.   In less than 100 days 67% of America's seniors are fully vaccinated.  More than 80% of seniors have 1 shot.  Instead of losing thousands of seniors a day Biden is saving them.  The portion of Black and White vaccinated is equal.  Biden has given 215 million shots and anyone over age 16 is now eligible. There has been a drop of 80% in deaths. Today if you’re outdoors and not in a big crowd you don’t need to wear a mask if you’re fully vaccinated. To India Biden is sending lots of mechanical parts needed and will advise when he can actually send vaccines.  Biden says “I think we will be able to share vaccines with other countries in real need. In the beginning when we were in a real bind India helped us.” Biden has kept 25 of 61 promises for the first 100 days.  Some think he views himself as FDR and LBJ who looks for big programs. Current challenge $1.5 trillion anti-poverty bill.
