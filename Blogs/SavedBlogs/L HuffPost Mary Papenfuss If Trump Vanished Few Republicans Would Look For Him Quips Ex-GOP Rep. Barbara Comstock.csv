L, If Trump Vanished Few Republicans Would Look For Him Quips Ex-GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, Mary Papenfuss, 2021-05-30, Most Republican elected officials are so weary of Donald Trump and his relentless negative impact on the party that if he “disappeared tomorrow I don’t think you’d have many Republicans in the search party” former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia speculated Sunday. “Maybe a few prosecutors” she joked to Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.” But “not Republicans.” The problem Comstock noted is that while Republicans “want to get away from him” Trump is “not going to go away.” And Republican lawmakers have to figure out a way to continue to help govern despite that and support things like a crucial decision to create a Jan. 6 commission.

Sicknick 42 suffered two strokes a day after he was assaulted by rioters. Some 140 officers were assaulted during what Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) has described as a typical tourist visit. “As lot of people still don’t understand how violent” the assault on the Capitol was noted Comstock. “Officer Fanone was tased 12 times at the back of his neck ... he has traumatic brain injuries and ... almost died that day” said Comstock. “He suffered a heart attack and people are still talking about these [attackers] were like tourists. We need to have that full story out. It’s going to get out one way or the other.” Check out Comstock’s entire interview in the video up top.
