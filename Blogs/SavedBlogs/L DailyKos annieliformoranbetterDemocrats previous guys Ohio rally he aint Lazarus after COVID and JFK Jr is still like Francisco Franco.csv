L, previous guy's Ohio rally: he ain't Lazarus after COVID and "JFK Jr" is still like Francisco Franco, annieliformoranbetterDemocrats, 2021-06-27, Previous guy had another rally on Saturday. He said the same stuff and had some of the same idiots there. As Trump keeps pumping out the same incitements to violence we can only hope that QAnon will be running the rotting corpse of JFK Jr in 2024. On the same Weekend at Bernies front apparently Trump was a lot sicker from COVID-19 than reported in 2020.  I've monitored right wing sites and channels for a long time. I swear they are more dangerous than ever these days. Somebody is gonna get killed. Trump's incitements at his Ohio rally last night as violent as his Jan. 6 rally. Tucker Hannity Newsmax OANN et al worse than ever. Both QAnon and longtime supporters of former President Donald Trump criticized his Saturday night speech in Wellington Ohio accusing him of the "same-old same-old" grievances against Democrats and his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. QAnon supporters some of whom are the former president's most fanatical online backers sent a barrage of messages through the Telegram app that expressed boredom and even anger at the speech Trump described as "the very first rally of the 2022 election." They blasted Trump for not mentioning how his January 6 insurrection supporters are "rotting in jail." And numerous others said Trump should be booed by the Ohio rallygoers for even "bringing up the word 'vaccine'" specifically because they believe COVID-19 was entirely a hoax. But a majority of the top QAnon user comments simply expressed their outright boredom with Trump's post-election stump speech in which he baselessly claimed to have won in November 2020 and blasted any dissenting GOP members as "traitors." www.newsweek.com/...  Trump rally in Ohio bored MAGAs leaving in droves during the speech. #TrumpLost pic.twitter.com/749t5G2bEQ  you call it a Trump rally I call it a delta variant incubation epicenter  Thinking about the celebrations that will take place around the country. https://t.co/seWtyB4Udv  Mo Brooks peddling tf out of his little bicycle (to escape from Jim Acosta) might be the funniest 💩 ever pic.twitter.com/s6dzRZQ1H5  “He wasn’t worried about others getting sick but he did fret about his own vulnerability and complained to his staff afterward. Why were they letting people get so close to him?” https://t.co/yKH6tjjwnL The week leading up to Trump’s infection was frenzied even by his standards. On Saturday Sept. 26 he had hosted a party with scores of maskless attendees to announce Amy Coney Barrett as his pick for Supreme Court justice. The celebrations had continued indoors where most people remained maskless. By that time the virus was surging again but Trump’s contempt for face coverings had turned into unofficial White House policy. He actually asked aides who wore them in his presence to take them off. If someone was going to do a news conference with him he made clear that he or she was not to wear a mask by his side. The day after the Supreme Court celebration Trump had also hosted military families at the White House. At Trump’s insistence few were wearing masks but they were packed in a little too tight for his comfort. He wasn’t worried about others getting sick but he did fret about his own vulnerability and complained to his staff afterward. Why were they letting people get so close to him? Meeting with the Gold Star families was sad and moving he said but added “If these guys had covid I’m going to get it because they were all over me.” He told his staff that they needed to do a better job of protecting him. [...] But Trump didn’t waver. Facing the cameras from the balcony he used his right hand to unhook the mask loop from his right ear then raised his left hand to pull the mask off his face. He was heavily made up his face more orange tinted than in the photos from the hospital. The helicopter’s rotors were still spinning. He put the mask into his right pocket as if he was discarding it once and for all then raised both hands in a thumbs-up. He was still probably contagious standing there for all the world to see. He made a military salute as the helicopter departed the South Lawn and then strode into the White House passing staffers on his way and failing to protect them from the virus particles emitted from his nose and mouth. Right then Redfield knew it was over. Trump showed in that moment that he hadn’t changed at all. The pandemic response wasn’t going to change either. www.washingtonpost.com/... Another person taking a picture with Vincent Fusca at the rally yesterday. QAnon believers think he’s JFK Jr. pic.twitter.com/z5iV6xiz54 Incredibly QAnon believers claim Kennedy has even appeared in public at Trump rallies posing as just another Trumpite. They latched onto a picture of a bearded middle-aged man in glasses standing in the stands behind Trump at one rally claiming that the man was actually Kennedy in disguise. In fact the man looks nothing like Kennedy. But QAnon supporters ran wild with the theory anyway trying to use facial aging programs to prove that he was Kennedy who would be 57 today. “JFK Jr was not a stupid man he KNEW what they did to his father” one well-received Reddit thread read claiming that the man at the Trump rally was “blatantly” disguised. QAnon believers began sifting through details of the man’s life for proof that he was actually Kennedy. They looked at the people standing next to him at the rally suspecting that another rally attendee was Kennedy’s wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy who was also killed in the crash. They analyzed the man’s name for clues and saw one in footage of the man near a DoubleTree hotel—as in body “double.” www.thedailybeast.com/... Here’s some background on the JFK Jr / QAnon thing. https://t.co/cEyTnBdTNV
