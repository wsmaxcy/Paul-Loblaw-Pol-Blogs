L, MOTHER EARTH NEEDS OUR HELP.LETS WORK TOGETHER TO SAVE HER!!, Chris Townsend, 2021-04-22, April 22nd is Earth Day. For so many of us like US Senate Candidate for Florida Allen Ellison it’s a day to protect and preserve this wondrous gift of nature and beauty it’s a day to remind everyone that what we have is precious and delicate. We must be reminded that we need to nurture our Mother Earth. So much damage has been done to her by mankind but we can reverse a lot of that damage. We must work together to cultivate the healing. In a State like Florida where the ecosystem is so diverse we must look at the damage we are doing and work to maintain this wonderful setting:  -One of Florida’s most precious gifts are the Everglades. It’s a vast ecologically populated area with many issues threatening its ecosystem. Issues like over population have caused problems like water pollution and a decrease in water throughout the Everglades. Also with a need for more land development humans are encroaching on the borders. All of these factors are threatening the wildlife of the area and the quality of the water.   -Another issue in Florida is pollution and waste generated from the ever growing tourism industry. Tourism generates over 40 tons of garbage annually. Recycling systems are being put into place but it’s something that needs more work and planning.  Humans leave their footprints where ever they gather in large groups and areas.   -Toxic algae pollutes the waterways killing aquatic life polluting the air and effecting businesses that depend on tourism and healthy fisheries might be the biggest problem afflicting the Florida ecosystem. It’s issue that is going to take a lot of support from the state and local governments to solve this ever spreading issue.  -Due to some of the aforementioned issues above several species are threatened with extinction. Some of worst are the Florida panther and manatee.  -Like all over the world global warming and climate change pose a threat to Florida. Florida is surrounded almost entirely by the ocean. So with sea levels rising it poses a particular threat to the costal ecosystem.  Community Leader and US Senate candidate Allen Ellison is committed to curbing the effects of climate change protecting America’s natural resources and ensuring the quality of our air water and land for current and future generations. “A focus on ways to address our environment’s biggest challenges paves the way to a more sustainable America and a brighter future.” States Ellison.
