C, Where is Kamala? 'Border Czar' snubs Arizona attorney general's invitation to tour the border , Karen Townsend, 2021-04-09, Joe Biden named Kamala Harris his ‘border czar’ yet she has not taken a trip to the southern border. Biden tossed the border crisis hot potato into her lap and then walked away. Her actions since that time have been underwhelming to say the least. Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council pointed out this morning during an interview on FNC that when Mike Pence was vice-president he traveled to the southern border to see for himself the situation on the ground. He gathered information and went back to Washington where changes were made to ease the problems. “We were never trained to do a humanitarian mission” he said. Border Patrol agents are trained to do law enforcement. The agency is overwhelmed by the number of migrants flooding the southern border now. Last month alone 172000 migrants showed up at the border. In other words it is impossible to understand the crisis from a lofty perch in Washington. A tour on the ground is required to get a handle on the situation. Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris has bothered to go to the border whether it is in Texas Arizona New Mexico or California. They don’t have to visit a state run by a Republican governor as in Texas or Arizona. Either of them can go to New Mexico or California which has Democrat governors. New Mexico’s Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham was once even on Biden’s list for potential vice-president picks. The latest invitation to come and take a tour came from Arizona’s Attorney General Mark Brnovich. He issued an invitation to Harris earlier this week. Attorney General Mark Brnovich is speaking out about the border crisis and the Biden administration response. He emphasizes the importance of seeing the situation as it is on the border. “I guess if you were a philosopher you would say no response is a very loud response because we’ve not received any response” Brnovich told Fox Business’ Dagen McDowell. He said the lack of communication from the administration has been “disappointing.” Brnovich said it would be important for Harris to see for herself what’s going on at the border including how the unfinished border wall has helped drug smugglers. Attorney General Brnovich said the Biden administration is doing all the right things to create a humanitarian crisis on the southern border. He notes it is cruel to promise migrants everything and then the American taxpayer is on the hook. Harris needs to “look into the eyes of people being smuggled across the border being exploited by the cartels and realize this is a humanitarian crisis on so many levels” Brnovich said. “It’s not fair to the migrants that think they’re being promised things it’s not fair to the people – the hardworking taxpayers of this country who are going to have to subsidize and pay for health care and child care and other social services for these migrants” he added. It’s also not fair to anyone when “you have literally criminals coming into this country” he continued. Brnovich even joked during one of his interviews yesterday by saying he’ll buy Kamala a pastry if she’ll come for a visit. That was a reference to Kamala’s trip to Chicago this week to talk about COVID-19 vaccines. She stopped off at a black-owned bakery and got herself a snack as the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki characterized that stop. The vice-president seems to have plenty of time to travel to Chicago where she could have also addressed the gun violence problem but didn’t and yet no time for the border. She also traveled this week to her home state of California and did not see fit to go to the border in that state. The State of Arizona is suing the Biden administration for an “unconscionable” halt to deportations. It is similar to the one filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Now Brnovich has filed a similar lawsuit against Biden’s DHS for the deportation halt arguing that the policy violates federal immigration and the state of Arizona’s agreement with the agency. Brnovich’s office said that within three days of the policy taking effect DHS released 27 illegal aliens from their custody in the Phoenix Arizona region. “Law enforcement officials have told the AGO that many of the individuals released were not properly tested for COVID-19 nor did DHS try to coordinate with local health or police agencies” Brnovich’s office wrote in a news release. “It is unconscionable for DHS to release potentially dangerous detainees into our state especially when no efforts are made to coordinate with applicable courts and probation departments” Brnovich said. “I am asking the court to enforce the law.” Kamala Harris has time to stand silently behind Joe Biden as he makes policy announcements and signs executive actions. Other than looking like she is included which is the point her presence serves no purpose. It’s for the photo ops. Biden is working to make sure Kamala has a smooth path to the presidential nomination whether it is in 2024 or 2028 depending on if he survives his full term. He knows she can’t get the Democrat Party’s nomination on her own as she failed spectacularly to do so in the 2020 Democrat primary. She points to Zoom calls she makes to foreign leaders including to Mexico and Central American leaders as though that is all she needs to do. It is inexcusable that neither Biden nor Harris has been to the border. The border crisis and immigration issues are the one area in which Biden is showing a lack of public support. He seems to think he can ignore the crisis continue calling it a challenge and stay in Washington thinking up more ways to spend trillions of taxpayer dollars. If neither he nor Kamala are in charge of the border who is?
