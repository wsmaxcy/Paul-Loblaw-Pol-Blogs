L, IAN:  May 9 2021 - blathering on, loggersbratforItzl Alert Network, 2021-05-08,   As you can see by Itzl's concerned look this group is for us to check in at to let people know we are alive doing OK and not affected by such things as heat blizzards floods wild fires hurricanes tornadoes power outages or other such things that could keep us off DKos.  It's also so we can find other Kossacks nearby for in-person checks when other methods of communication fail - a buddy system. Members come here to check in.  If you're not here or anywhere else on DKos and there are adverse conditions in your area (floods heatwaves hurricanes etc.) we and your buddy are going to check up on you.  If you are going to be away from your computer for a day or a week let us know here.  We care! IAN is a great group to join and a good place to learn to write diaries.  Drop one of us a PM to be added to the Itzl Alert Network anytime!  We all share the publishing duties and we welcome everyone who reads IAN to write diaries for the group!  Every member is an editor so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say photos and music to share a cause to promote or news! ************************* It seems that there were a lot more indigenous Australians than has been thought.  Apparently an irritated farmer moved the border between France and Belgium. Research methods continue to advance.  There’s a method recently developed to extract DNA from archaeological specimens without having to completely destroy them. Bible quotes that aren’t in the Bible.  Well I thought this was funny. A study on cats and where they sit. ************************* I walked my grandson to school on Monday and found out that even using the cane I’m going to have to build up my endurance before doing much of that.  It’s a mile and a half round trip which is easy when I’m not hurting; but I haven’t done all that long of walks any time recently because pain so I have to build up to it. Tuesday we drove to and from school.  He wanted to stay after for a while and his best friend (who’s in the morning in-person sessions) was brought along to play.  A good time was had by all.  Wednesdays are on-line only and for a couple of different reasons he didn’t do the in-person classes either Thursday (something due to the school) or Friday (personal). ************************* How many of the rest of you who are vaccinated and past the two weeks have noticed what I have?   Now that I can go out and do things if I want to it’s not making me crazy if I don’t go.  I think the problem was not having a real choice.   And since I am more of a solitary than a lot of people it took me most of the year to get to that point. ************************* I have just finished reading a new one by my librarian/author friend in the Boston area.  Eclipse by Celia Lake.  It’s every bit as good as any of her others that I’ve read but not quite as complex as the previous one. *************************
