L, Kagro in the Morning podcast (AUDIO): Monday June 28 2021, Scott Anderson, 2021-06-28, Happy Monday which is like the weekend but with more memes and 100% more David Waldman and Greg Dworkin! This weekend a social media influencer at the Tour de France introduced hundreds of teeth to macadam and discovered it is possible to become too well known. Who knows where COVID-19 came from but where it’s going is Trump country. That’s where kids sneak out behind their parents back to get vaccinated. A booster might now be needed for the Delta variant. Don’t worry it’s just like the flu except with 1 in 50 dying.  What does this mean to the Republican party? You mean outside of a loss of voters? Not much. Donald is kind of turned on though. The ACLU found out that whichever seat in the lunchroom you pick that’s Trump’s seat and a blackeye is the least of your worries. By the way the 2nd Amendment does not prohibit ownership of an F-15. Look it up. Americans are worried about crime but that doesn’t mean they’re blaming Democrats. Speaking of criminals William Barr and Donald Trump always knew that sooner or later only one of them would be left standing. Barr drew first but everyone knows Barr’s not a straight shooter. It’s now Donald’s turn and soon Mitch will be gunning for Bill also. QAnon is going the way of the John Birch Society… which is absolutely nowhere. Those people may not ever understand the words “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” but they have been the same believers for centuries. The Catholic church has been around for a while also but hating on Joe Biden might not have been that well thought out. Lovable Joe Biden says what he means and means what he says but no one needs to hear all that. Infrastructure negotiations are back on track as Joe Manchin lowers his standard for bipartisanism to mutual eye contact.
