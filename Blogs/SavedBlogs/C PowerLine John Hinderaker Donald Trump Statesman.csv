C, Donald Trump Statesman, John Hinderaker, 2021-01-08, Yesterday President Trump released this statesmanlike video looking ahead to the end of his administration. He won’t get any credit for it of course but if his worst moments are trumpeted and promoted ad nauseam you may at least have the opportunity to see it:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
