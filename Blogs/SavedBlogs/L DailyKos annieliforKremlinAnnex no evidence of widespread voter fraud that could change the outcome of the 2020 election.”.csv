L, "no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election.”, annieliforKremlinAnnex, 2021-06-27, Previous guy referring to himself in the 3rd person like a royal wee with prostitutes in the Moscow Ritz. Because even a lackey like Bill Barr will ultimately betray him if only for self-preservation as the cover-ups and obstructions are revealed. Donald trump is a man consumed with grievance against people he believes have betrayed him but few betrayals have enraged him more than what his attorney general did to him. To Trump the unkindest cut of all was when William Barr stepped forward and declared that there had been no widespread fraud in the 2020 election just as the president was trying to overturn Joe Biden’s victory by claiming that the election had been stolen. In a series of interviews with me this spring Barr spoke for the first time about the events surrounding his break with Trump. I have also spoken with other senior officials in the Trump White House and Justice Department who provided additional details about Barr’s actions and the former president’s explosive response. Barr and those close to him have a reason to tell his version of this story. He has been widely seen as a Trump lackey who politicized the Justice Department. But when the big moment came after the election he defied the president who expected him to do his bidding. Barr’s betrayal came on December 1 over lunch in the attorney general’s private dining room with Michael Balsamo a Justice Department beat reporter at the Associated Press. Also in attendance were the DOJ chief of staff Will Levi and spokesperson Kerri Kupec. Balsamo was not told the reason for the invitation. When Barr dropped his bombshell between bites of salad he mumbled and Balsamo wasn’t sure that he had caught what the attorney general had said. “Just to be crystal clear” Balsamo asked “are you saying—” www.theatlantic.com/... When Bill Barr told the truth about the election results Trump reacted exactly as people expected he would. https://t.co/4Uidan8kt9 pic.twitter.com/nwzQE04SY8  We still need to prosecute Barr for his interference and cover up of the Mueller investigation his abuse of federal police during riots  and his use of DOJ to go after members of the press & congress. Also - where is the Durham report?? https://t.co/N5wZWZjbKr  What did Rod Rosenstein know and when did he know it?  NY DA Vance to Indict Trump Organization. Will this inspire other jurisdictions to finally indict Trump? It should . .  . because #JusticeMatters https://t.co/twuXAZDDGr via @YouTube  This reporting from ProPublica offers extremely strong evidence that the Trump White House orbit knew the kind of danger they were playing with on Jan 6https://t.co/arBMkFSmI5 pic.twitter.com/pHQnFKWPkL  Interestingly Trump didn’t argue when Barr told him that his “clown show” legal team had wasted time. In fact he said “You may be right about that.” www.theatlantic.com/... Same 'ol MTG bullshit. Tossing out lies with no proof. https://t.co/3IUVDBxAZH    Powell was given white glove service by the attorney general’s office as she sought to tank the prosecution of Mike Flynn after the fact; Barr embraced her scurrilous attacks on his people. And Giuliani was given a US Attorney by Barr to be his conduit for Ukraine misinformation.     Seems Pretty Bad https://t.co/dvv1ZxPJxG pic.twitter.com/IxCjcHZQuq     Bill Barr's self-image rehab tour has begun. Don't buy it. Barr tells tales of denying the big lie *after* the election but he omits that he aggressively promoted that lie in the crucial months *before* the election. I set it straight in my book: https://t.co/qdpi602A85
