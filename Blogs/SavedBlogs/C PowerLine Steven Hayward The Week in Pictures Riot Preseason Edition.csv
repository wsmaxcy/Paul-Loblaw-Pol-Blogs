C, The Week in Pictures: Riot Preseason Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-17, Prediction: If Derek Chauvin is found guilty by the Minneapolis jury there will be riots anyway like we sometimes see in a city that wins the Super Bowl or World Series. Dust off Edward Banfield’s chapter on “Rioting Mostly for Fun and Profit” in The Unheavenly City.   Which I may just talk about on our podcast this week. In the meantime. . .                                      Headlines of the week:                                          And finally. . .  our own “Lucretia” (and you can see why no one messes with her):    Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
Inscription on the Liberty Bell
