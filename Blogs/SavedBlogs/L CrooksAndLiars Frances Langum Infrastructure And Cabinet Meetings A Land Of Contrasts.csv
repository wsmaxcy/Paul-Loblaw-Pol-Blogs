L, Infrastructure And Cabinet Meetings: 'A Land Of Contrasts', Frances Langum, 2021-04-03, On Thursday's All In guest host Medhi Hassan asked a hilarious question:  Why didn't Donald Trump do an infrastructure bill?  The occasion was Joe Biden's first in-person cabinet meeting which was predictably professional and focused on business.  This is a land of contrast apart from the typical Trump cabinet meeting which was an on-camera worship session for Mango Mussolini.  Medhi Hassan also discussed Ezra Klein's tweets from Wednesday: It's become a punchline but it really is remarkable that Trump didn't do an infrastructure plan in his four years in office. Particularly at the beginning he could've peeled off scared Democrats. The whole country could have roads and bridges with his face on them. â€” Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) March 31 2021 People who have absolutely no interest in the work of governance don't govern well even by their own measures. Trump said he wanted a massive rebuilding of American infrastructure. He likes building things. I think he did want it. He just didn't want to do the work. â€” Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) March 31 2021 Hassan asked "Wasn't he the infrastructure guy? The guy who liked to build things or at least slap his name on things? ...Is it remarkable though? It's Donald Trump. He wasn't interested in governing only performing. ...he just didn't want to do the work.  ... He just wanted to be on TV. All the time. Ideally being praised adored cheered whether it was at rallies or even his own cabinet meetings." Seriously? He didn't hire anybody who had any interest in it except Bannon who is almost as incapable as he is and survived only a few months. He has no idea how any legislative or executive job is done. All he could do was tweet that it was Infrastructure Week and hope. https://t.co/HjMLSX7WN9 â€” Jumpin Jack Flash It's a Yas Yas Yas (@Yastreblyansky) April 2 2021 Meanwhile Biden and his cabinet are doing THE WORK.   This NYT chart reflecting Biden's infrastructure plan shows a huge investment in keeping seniors in their homes as well as affordable housing for working families.  Those investments WILL TRANSLATE to a huge savings for the government that will pay for itself. pic.twitter.com/4w86RBkmDr â€” Frances Langum ðŸ§¶ (@bluegal) April 2 2021 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
