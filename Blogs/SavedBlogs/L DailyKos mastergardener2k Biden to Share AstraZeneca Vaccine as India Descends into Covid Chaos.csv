L, Biden to Share AstraZeneca Vaccine as India Descends into Covid Chaos, mastergardener2k, 2021-04-26, The Biden Administration is preparing to send millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to other nations. The FDA has not yet approved AstraZenca’s vaccine for injections in the US and enough of the three approved vaccines are likely to be delivered before May 31 to jab every American who wants a dose. Meanwhile India’s healthcare system is having a catastrophic meltdown as the number of Covid-19 cases is far exceeding what it can handle.  www.politico.com/… The Biden administration is preparing to send up to 60 million AstraZeneca doses to countries in need over the next several months once a federal safety review is conducted according to two senior Biden administration officials. The company has produced about 10 million doses of the vaccine for the U.S. but the FDA has not yet authorized their use. The agency is still examining the doses to ensure they meet the necessary quality control standards. An additional 50 million doses are in production one of the senior officials said. It is unclear where the U.S. will send the AstraZeneca doses...

Many other nations are also sending help but the suffering is enormous. apnews.com/… India was initially seen as a success story in weathering the pandemic but the virus is now racing through its population of nearly 1.4 billion and systems are beginning to collapse.
