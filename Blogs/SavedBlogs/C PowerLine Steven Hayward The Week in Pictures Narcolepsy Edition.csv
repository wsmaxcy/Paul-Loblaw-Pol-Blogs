C, The Week in Pictures: Narcolepsy Edition, Steven Hayward, 2021-05-01, I heard Joe Biden gave a speech to Congress this week. Or at least some of Congress. I heard Ted Cruz fell asleep in the middle of it. Maybe he was merely emulating (P)resident Biden our first fully somnambulist president? Meanwhile Biden’s blowout spending proposals are giving a whole new meaning to “go for broke.” (Hat tip: RS.)                                                 Headlines of the week:                          A delicacy in Mordor.                                 And finally. . . our very own “Lucretia” once again back on the range this week:  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.”
