L, US State Vaccination Rates vs Partisan Voting Index, Irontortoise, 2021-05-08, This will probably come as no surprise to anyone here but as we move further into the vaccination program for Covid-19 it turns out willingness to get vaccinated is increasingly tied to each State’s Partisan Voting Index in the 2020 Election where the PVI is the margin Biden won or lost each State by.  Note that in the earlier part of the program back in March there was essentially no difference between Red and Blue States in terms of vaccination rates with Alaska the Dakotas and West Virginia off to particularly fast starts. But as we moved through April and into May it’s becoming clear that the States are increasingly seeing their current vaccination rates sorted by their PVI with the R^2 correlation now up to a fairly impressive 0.60 for a straightforward linear trend line analysis.  Note also that of those Red States that did get off to a relatively fast start only North Dakota is still well ahead of the national average at this point — perhaps their experience with being at the very center of one of the most intense phases of this pandemic last fall had something to do with it?
