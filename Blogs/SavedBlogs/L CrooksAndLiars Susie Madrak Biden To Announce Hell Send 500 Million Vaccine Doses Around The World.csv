President Joe Biden will announce the plan this week at the Group of Seven meeting in Great Britain. Via the Washington Post: The Biden administration is buying 500 million doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine to donate to the world as the United States dramatically increases its efforts to help vaccinate more of the global population three people familiar with the plans said Wednesday. The first 200 million doses will be distributed this year with the subsequent 300 million shared in the first half of next year. The doses will be distributed by Covax the World Health Organization-backed initiative to share doses around the globe and they will be targeted at low- and middle-income countries. Pfizer is selling the doses to the United States at a “not-for-profit” price according to the people familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details that were not yet public. President Biden is slated to announce the plan this week at the Group of Seven meeting in Britain where he is expected to be joined by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. The deal comes amid growing calls for the United States and other rich countries to play a more substantial role in boosting the global supply of coronavirus vaccines. This is a great start. When America is at its best it’s a force for good in the world.https://t.co/fAZ0wy5Yij — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 9 2021 "What [Biden's] launching is a vaccine Marshall Plan. He's going back to the greatest efforts in American history... the triumph in WWII and then the incredibly generous plan... that helped Europe and Japan get back on their feet" - @stengel w/ @NicolleDWallace pic.twitter.com/mpk4C3wBmY — Deadline White House (@DeadlineWH) June 9 2021 WH Fact Sheet on President Biden’s planned announcement today that the United States will purchase and donate 500 million Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and the African Union. pic.twitter.com/7pgauitMag — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) June 10 2021 Biden should offer Iran the COVID vaccine  https://t.co/vJMDxSOA0B — Eli Lake (@EliLake) June 10 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
