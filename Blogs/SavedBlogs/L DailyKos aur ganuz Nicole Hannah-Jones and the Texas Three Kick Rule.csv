L, Nicole Hannah-Jones and the Texas Three Kick Rule, aur ganuz, 2021-07-07, From this morning’s Good News Roundup: I also love that Hannah-Jones said: “It’s not my job to heal the University of North Carolina." YES! Say that!It is NOT our job as Black scholars to heal these raggedy and obstinate PWIs that can't or won't step up to treat us with the respect we have earned and deserve. https://t.co/5EQbjU7iVS — Equity Scientist (@BmoreDoc) July 6 2021  This has been well diarized so I wont go there. However I do believe Hannah-Jones instituted the Texas Three Kick Rule: A big-city Philadelphia lawyer went duck hunting in rural Texas. He shot and dropped a bird but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded "I shot a duck and it fell into this field and now I'm going to retrieve it." The old farmer replied "This is my property and you are not coming over here."The indignant lawyer said "I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. and if you don't let me get that duck I'll sue you and take everything you own." The old farmer smiled and said "Apparently you don't know how we do things in Texas. We settle small disagreements like this with the Texas Three-Kick-Rule."The lawyer asked What is the Texas Three-Kick-Rule?." The farmer replied "Well first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up." The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on this belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said "OK you old coot! Now it's my turn." The old farmer smiled and said "No I give up you can keep the duck."
