L, PAYBACK: Biden Administration Announces Sanctions Against Russia For Cyber Attacks, Susie Madrak, 2021-04-15, The Biden administration has imposed the first significant sanctions in several years against the Russian economy and officially names the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for the Solar Winds hack and the Kremlin for their work to influence the 2016 presidential election. Via the Washington Post: The administration also sanctioned six Russian companies that support Russian spy services’ cyberhacking operations and will expel 10 intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover in the United States. The measures are an effort to make good on President Biden’s vow to hold Moscow accountable for a series of operations including the hacking operation commonly known as SolarWinds which compromised nine federal agencies and about 100 private firms. “Our view is that no single action that we will take or could take in and of itself could directly alter Russia’s malign behavior” principal deputy national security adviser Jonathan Finer said. “But this is going to be a process that is going to take place over time and it will involve a mix of significant pressure and finding ways to work together.” The Treasury Department just said that Konstantin Kilimnik a Manafort associate "provided the Russian Intelligence Services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy" during the 2016 election. https://t.co/nTyYgBpxkK — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 15 2021 BREAKING: President Biden announces new sanctions on Russia expulsion of 10 diplomats in retaliation for hacking and election interference. https://t.co/Kzqvw31RcG — The Associated Press (@AP) April 15 2021 The Biden administration announced it will sanction dozens of Russian officials and entities expel 10 diplomats from the U.S. and set new restrictions on buying sovereign debt in response to the massive SolarWinds hack of federal agencies and interference in the 2020 election. — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 15 2021 Treasury sanctions—and exposes—six Russian technology companies contracting with various Russian intelligence agencies (unsurprisingly in case you wondered Kaspersky is *not* one of them) https://t.co/NvetRJCxXl pic.twitter.com/c2RnChRMoT — Thomas Rid (@RidT) April 15 2021 #BREAKING NATO allies 'stand in solidarity' with US on Russia sanctions imposed in response to Moscow's 'destabilising activities': statement pic.twitter.com/286kHW6B4U — AFP News Agency (@AFP) April 15 2021 Just re-posting this old article in response to today’s expulsion of Russian intel officers.
