But a new study from the London School of Economics says 50 years of such tax cuts have only helped one group ‚Äî the rich. The new paper by David Hope of the London School of Economics and Julian Limberg of King's College London examines 18 developed countries ‚Äî from Australia to the United States ‚Äî over a 50-year period from 1965 to 2015. The study compared countries that passed tax cuts in a specific year such as the U.S. in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes on the wealthy with those that didn't and then examined their economic outcomes. Per capita gross domestic product and unemployment rates were nearly identical after five years in countries that slashed taxes on the rich and in those that didn't the study found.  Missouri's agriculture industry will face the harsh realities of the #climate emergency if action isn't taken. @IMidwest https://t.co/pMg9yxifEN Without an official statewide climate plan Missourians must look elsewhere for direction A staple of industry and identity in the state ‚Äî agriculture has a stake in Missouri's economy and people's livelihoods. But Missouri‚Äôs agriculture industry will face the harsh realities of the climate emergency if action isn‚Äôt taken. The¬†Fourth National Climate Assessment¬†by the U.S. Global Change Research Program states that in the Midwest climate change will reduce agricultural productivity in the next 30 years due to increased precipitation and extreme temperatures. That is unless there are major technological advances. Not only will more rain cause less flexibility for spring planting and worsen soil erosion but higher overall temperatures will also reduce yields for staple crops in Missouri like corn and soybeans.  We're destabilizing the planet. Meanwhile our leaders continue to destroy present and future living conditions - opening new pipelines oilfields and investing fantasy amounts into fossil fuel infrastructure despite all the beautiful words.#MindTheGap between words and action. https://t.co/TalbTE3DVy  .@JohnBerman: "CNN has just obtained a letter sent to residents in April of this year.

Here's an interesting story about a farmer who wants to save his farm by leasing a portion of his land for solar but can't because it's ‚Äúprime farmland‚Äù https://t.co/AidSQFdPK2 Moreau farmers seek to harvest solar energy but only if town lets them In 2014 Patrick Killian was faced with a decision: Either sell his 300 dairy cows or lose his family farm. He was just months removed from constructing a new barn for the animals when milk prices began to slip. Sensing a dramatic shift in the market Killian opted to sell the cows in a bid to preserve his 500-acre farm along Burt Road which has been in his family since the 1950s. ‚ÄúSelling the cows was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve had to do‚Äù Killian said. ‚ÄúMy family was devastated.‚Äù Three days after selling the cows Killian said milk prices dropped dramatically. He made the right decision.
