L, WYFP - Finals Hell or How I Am Avoiding My Final Paper, Mortifyd, 2021-05-08, As the days get longer and we continue to count the Omer (the 7 weeks between Passover and Shavuot) the pressure is ramping up until now — the final week of the semester And what am I doing? Anything to avoid working on my paper knowing full well that it is due today and Shabbat starts at 7:32 and doesn’t end until 8:30 Saturday night. I will not work on my paper then but I can as soon as its over and get it to her Sunday.  She’s  been super cool if a little less than guiding but she’s a good teacher. The paper seems straight forward — I have a title the citation for the article I am reworking an outline of what needs to be in the paper and directions available at all times to keep things going but I just can’t seem to start. I suppose I can try to break it down into smaller parts but I have to fit a summary an explanation of the data and the primary goals a different framework framework introduced the data is reevaluated through that lense a new conclusion posited and a final contrast and compare of the two methods — based on 32 pages and compressed to a final length of 6-8 pages. That’s kind of a feat. So I have the original article two lectures on different theories another article describing my secondary framework — and the data to evaluate in a new light. It’s only worth about 20% of my grade and I’m solid As on classwork discussion so I have some wobble room but I really need to pull this off. In other things I’m seeing more and more people not wearing masks and it creeps me out. Myself and the two therapists were the only ones wearing masks in the work out pool and I was the only one in the hot tub with a mask on too. I did the shopping today on the way home and got the basics I needed for Shabbat and the weekend — bread soda bagels vegetarian meals etc — so I can just chill for a day.  I really need that. I have to call back the guy from the membership committee and see how much the shul wants for membership dues he called me almost a month ago and I just saved it in  my phone. I have done my part to energize the economy so I hope they don’t expect a lot from me because I’m broke — I have a good budget but I might be cutting it a bit close this time. I had some sudden expenses and that’s all it takes really. I will be glad when school comes back in for 2 reasons — I’ll likely be bored over the summer and I will have money from grants to pay down my bills. I have a credit card that is nearly maxed out that needs to go down — and if it doesn’t could be a problem. I do have a plan for summer since I’m not doing field school — I’m going to help mum restock and run her Ebay store to basically sell the stuff she bought on Ebay to someone else. Carnival glass all kinds of stuff — coins plate collectables I don’t even know how much stuff there is for us to go through. But I do know how to organize ship and track stuff so it should be fine. She only wants to do about 2-3 pieces a week so it shouldn’t be too taxing. I’m terrible at taking pictures though. So that’s my week for the most part stress and avoidance — the trap of finals week.  I did get an A on my final exam for Script Lit — so that’s 3 As for the semester including both geology classes my anthropology theory is going well other than this paper and I just have to wait and see for CRM (cultural resource management) grades to be posted. I can’t put it off any longer I’m starting to get anxious.  See you Saturday night!
