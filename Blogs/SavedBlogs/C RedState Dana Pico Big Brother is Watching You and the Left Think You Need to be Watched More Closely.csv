C, Big Brother is Watching You and the Left Think You Need to be Watched More Closely, Dana Pico, 2020-12-25, In George Orwell’s 1984 every home was fitted with a Telescreen. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen it was called) could be dimmed but there was no way of shutting it off completely. . . . . The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made above the level of a very low whisper would be picked up by it; moreover so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. After nine months now of increasingly draconian controls of our society and our economy in the huge governmental response to COVID-19 we are now being told that the one place into which government cannot reach our homes is the place in which our leaders need to exert the most control. By Dr. Adjoa Smalls-Mantey | December 24 2020 | 6:08 AM COVID-19 is a highly transmissible disease but evidence shows that small indoor gatherings and households are where the novel coronavirus is spreading the fastest. For nearly a year public health officials across the globe have grappled with how to reduce the spread of COVID-19. At times travel has been restricted schools and gyms have closed and some cities such as San Francisco are under lockdown. But despite these restrictions the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths continue to reach record highs. “I think we want to be careful about blaming one particular environment and scapegoating one particular setting for generating transmission” said Dr. John Brownstein an ABC News contributor epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. However there are some settings where COVID-19 is more easily spread. In New York for example contact tracing has shown that 70% of new cases come from small gatherings and households. “Informal gatherings may have played even the biggest role” Brownstein said “because they are harder to police they’re harder to enforce and people are probably more lax when it comes to recommendations of mask wearing and social distancing.” I will admit to some amusement at Dr. Adjoa Smalls-Mantey’s the author’s choice of language that informal gatherings meetings between friends and family “are harder to police (are) harder to enforce” restrictions. In the end of course policing things enforcing rules is precisely what Our Betters want to do. Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Health Dr Richard Levine¹ issued orders that individuals must wear masks and practice social distancing inside their own homes if guests are present. The credentialed media were also full of similar recommendations. When people gather in small groups with friends and family they are more likely to let their guard down not wear their masks and stay together indoors for longer periods of time which makes it easier to transmit the virus. In a recent study at the University of Mississippi Medical Center researchers found that for children and adolescents who tested positive for COVID-19 it was small social gatherings — not school — that was the most likely place they were exposed to the virus. The children who tested positive in the study were more likely to have attended social gatherings outside of their homes had playdates or had visitors at their home where mask wearing and social distancing precautions were not taken. As we have noted previously various officials know that they can’t just send the gendarmerie into your house so they want your neighbors to peer into your windows and snitch on you. Of course Mayor Bill de Blasio (D-New York City) does seem to think that he can send the sheriff’s deputies to your home so perhaps other of our government officials will try to make my statement that they can’t send the police to your homes a false one. A conspiracy theorist might suggest that Dr Smalls-Mantey’s article is just something to condition the public into thinking that such is regrettably necessary so that the sheeple will simply accept it at least if it only happens to their neighbors and not themselves. Governor Andy Beshear (D-KY) issued executive orders limiting gatherings in your home of more than eight people from more than two separate households. I am happy to say that we didn’t obey the Governor’s restrictions any heed on either Thanksgiving or Christmas. Three households no masks. If only the government had those telescreens they wouldn’t have to depend on those Gladys Kravitzes to peer into your windows!² Am I just being paranoid here? In 1984 sexual activity is regulated by the government and Winston Smith’s and Julia’s sexual life is a form of rebellion. And in 2020 Dr Levine issued ‘guidance’ about your sex life ‘suggesting’ that you must ‘limit’ your number of sex partners and always ‘discuss’ COVID-19 with any new potential inamorata. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D-Washington DC) did the same.³ People with actual governing authority have been telling us how we must live our lives interfering in our jobs our businesses and trying to impose their authority even in our homes justifying it as an emergency of course. But if they are allowed to get away with this for the COVID emergency just what other ’emergencies’ can they use to justify restricting our rights? The September 11th attacks wound up justifying the PATRIOT Act and sadly that was done by Republican congressmen and senators and signed into law by a Republican president. Benjamin Franklin put it best saying “Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.” We have surrendered some of our essential liberty and far too many of our people have agreed with this because it’s just so necessary or as the law would put it “a compelling government interest.” This is where we must say nay scream that government cannot do this and the people will not allow it. More than just scream we must protest we must take political action to unseat the would-be tyrants and petty dictators. If we do not do this now we insure that it will happen again and again as those who believe they should run our lives for us can always find something to justify it.

² – I had to put a descriptive link to Gladys Kravitz in the article because my good friend Donald Douglas pointed out that you have to be older than dirt to get the reference.
³ – The left had always claimed that it was evil reich-wing conservatives who wanted to regulate sex even referencing 1984 but it doesn’t seem to have been conservatives doing this now does it?
