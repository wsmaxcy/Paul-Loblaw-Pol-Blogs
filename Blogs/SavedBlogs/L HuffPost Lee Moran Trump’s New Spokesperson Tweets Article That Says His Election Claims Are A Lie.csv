L, Trump’s New Spokesperson Tweets Article That Says His Election Claims Are A Lie, Lee Moran, 2021-07-05, It appears someone didn’t read the full story. Liz Harrington the new spokesperson for Donald Trump on Sunday tweeted a Bradenton Herald article about the former president’s campaign-style rally in Sarasota Florida. She highlighted this line from the story with her tweet conveniently omitting that the claim was made by the rally’s organizers: “Saturday’s Save America Rally in Sarasota attracted a record crowd to the Sarasota Fairgrounds organizers said.”  People on the platform mocked Harrington because the very same article disputed Trump’s claim about the 2020 election being stolen from him. In the tweet the subheadline of the story read: “There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would have affected the outcome of the election.” "Saturday’s Save America Rally in Sarasota attracted a record crowd to the Sarasota Fairgrounds"https://t.co/X5IRlXXRpm That point was repeated in the story itself including in this line: Though there has never been any substantial evidence of voter fraud that would have overturned Trump’s 2020 defeat as Trump has claimed supporters in the crowd maintained that “Trump won.” Twitter users ribbed Harrington a former spokesperson for the Republican National Committee over her post:  Thanks Liz!
