L, ECMO LONG HAULER—A NURSE’S JOURNEY, Portland True Blue, 2021-04-25, I spent the last 8 days with my COVID long hauler he has been on ECMO for over 5 weeks.  Still too sick to come off ECMO sometimes slowly progressing sometimes plateauing sometimes regressing—it’s an medical and emotional rollercoaster.  He has been my primary patient since he arrived. This is the story of our journey.    He came in by air ambulance and was picked at the airport by COVID transport.  We knew he was on the way and very very sick.  I was part of the rapid response team (RRT)  because I had been assigned to be his primary nurse.  He was on high flow but not intubated. He came directly to our unit with the  COVID RRT.  He was in ARDS with severe dyspnea but minimally conscious  he thought he was going to die—I thought he might too.  Since he was actively infected he was in an AIIR and we were in full PPE including PAPRs. My job was to try to keep him calm while the COVID RRT worked their choreographed medical ballet.  I sat on a low stool at his eye level holding his hand and reassuring him—his fingers were cold even though he had a high temperature not a good sign.  It truly is miraculous to see the RRT work—almost like one brain with 7 bodies.  In rapid order he was intubated sedated on the monitors three IV sets with 3 ports each 7 drips on pumps set up.  RRT left but the RT and Intensivist remained with me and the patient.  The next 12  hours were intense—critical care in every sense of the meaning.  It was a mentally and physically exhausting but somehow we pulled it off and he was still alive.  Around midnight we felt confident enough to let the second team take over.  I knew he was going to ECMO the next morning and I needed to be there.  I found a vacant bed at the end of the hall and slept.  Getting him hooked up on ECMO went smoothly.  He was still so sick probably 50/50 between living or dying. Everything that had to be done had been done he was in the hands of an extremely professional competent ECMO tech I went home for a few days of rest.    I was back on my regular rotation 3 days on one day off 3 days on 7 days off—except it never quite works out that way. Now the long haul began—never routine periods of calm interspersed with emergencies.  This is critical care nursing why I became a CCRN and why it is unimaginable for me to do anything else.  About 3 weeks in he got a tracheotomy which is standard practice.  His viral load lessened until he was no longer infectious but still so sick. Slowly his sedation level was reduced till he regained consciousness.  The first time he responded and squeezed my hand—such joy.  During the last 8 days he has been able to communicate no sedation just pain meds.  He knows he is still very sick but that we are doing everything  possible—he is frightened and gets anxious.  He wants to know exactly what I am doing he is curious a sign his metal abilities are intact.  I tease him that he might want to become an ECMO nurse. We have been trying to wean him off the ventilator and get his lungs functioning again but it is difficult—his stats just plummet.  Slowly trying to reduce his dependence on ECMO.  I am cautiously hopeful about his survival —not sure about long term he may need lung transplants and will probably lose some toes but just want him to have that opportunity to live.  I am heavily invested in my patient.   I plan to enjoy the next 7 days sleeping and vegetating—after laundry and grocery shopping.  My dirty clothes hamper has overflowed so much that I can’t close my closet door.  I have no food tonight I scraped the last remnants of peanut butter out of the jar and spread it on the last heel of bread.  It was so stale I could use it for sandpaper.  Tomorrow I feast tonight I soak my feet and sleep.
