L, Elizabeth Warren just endorsed Sam Rasoul.  Rural politics are now in play?, Beverly Harrison, 2021-05-05, I am a wildly enthusiastic supporter of Sam Rasoul.  #FullDisclosure.   Elizabeth Warren just publicly endorsed Sam — who is running for Lieutenant Governor in Virginia — and even sent out an endorsement email to her supporters.  Best email I’ve had in years.  She sees what many of us in Virginia have seen for years — a deeply committed person who genuinely cares for others with a progressive vision for the future and the skills to work with others to bring that vision into reality. Sam Rasoul is a hard worker who dreams big fights hard and gets results Warren said in a statement. Sam is the passionate progressive voice Virginians deserve. He walks the talk just ask the near 1000 people assisted by his office thanks to the campaign’s Democratic Promise which helps Virginians in need access services and assistance.  Do you have to be in Sam’s district to receive his help?  Nope.  That’s just how he rolls.  Sam Rasoul is for all of us. I’m showing up for Sam and hope you will too. Volunteer.  Learn more about his campaign. Donate.
