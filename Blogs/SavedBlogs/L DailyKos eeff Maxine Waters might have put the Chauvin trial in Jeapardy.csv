I looked at several sites.  Chauvin trial judge says Maxine Waters' 'confrontational' protest remarks could fuel appeal The judge in Derek Chauvin's murder trial in the death of George Floyd criticized recent comments by Rep. Maxine Waters D-Calif. and said her words could be grounds for the defense to appeal a verdict. The congresswoman who has long been a lightning rod for criticism from the right was already facing a torrent of Republican ire for her comments over the weekend urging protesters in Minnesota to “get more confrontational” if Chauvin is not convicted with several GOP lawmakers calling for Waters' expulsion from Congress. Chauvin's lawyer asked the judge to declare a mistrial over Waters' comments arguing that she had prejudiced the jury. Judge Peter Cahill denied the request but said that Waters' comments were "abhorrent" and that she may have handed the defense a lifeline anyway.
