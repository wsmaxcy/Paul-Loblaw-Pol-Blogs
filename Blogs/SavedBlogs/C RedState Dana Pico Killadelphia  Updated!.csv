C, Killadelphia * Updated!, Dana Pico, 2020-12-25, The Philadelphia Police Department only updates its Current Crime Stats page on normal business days so the numbers are current as of 11:59 PM on Wednesday December 23rd where they show that 482 souls have gone to their eternal rewards due to homicide in the City of Brotherly Love in 2020. Uncharacteristically The Philadelphia Inquirer has told us the tales since then. Yesterday there was this: by Catherine Dunn | December 24 2020 | 9:11 PM EST A 20-year-old man who was shot multiple times died Thursday morning Philadelphia police said. The shooting occurred in the city’s Overbook section on the 1800 block of Wynnewood Road about 11:30 a.m. according to police. The man was taken to Lankenau Medical Center and pronounced dead at 11:46 a.m. In a statement police said that a preliminary investigation indicated the victim was outside recording on social media when another man approached him started a verbal altercation and then shot the victim. When police arrived authorities said they found the victim lying in the grass with multiple wounds to the torso. . . .  Hours later at 1:42 p.m. a shooting in Philadelphia’s Kensington section led to the death of another young man. The victim was about 20 years old police said. He was shot five times on the 3200 block of G Street according to information provided by police. In neither case was an arrest made or weapons recovered. The Inquirer noted that no motive was determined in the first shooting. Assuming those were the only two homicides on Christmas Eve well 482 + 2 = 484. Today is Christmas Day a day of peace and love and brotherhood right? by Diane Mastrull | December 25 2020 | 2:51 PM EST Christmas morning got off to a grim start in Philadelphia when a street fight escalated to one man firing a gun into a crowd striking two teenagers in the neck before officers fatally shot him according to police. A 15-year-old male whose identity was not released was pronounced dead at Temple University Hospital where a 17-year-old remained Friday in stable condition police said. The alleged gunman 43 was shot in the torso and pronounced dead at Temple police said. Police did not disclose how many times he was hit just that two officers fired at him about 12:30 a.m. on the 3300 block of Emerald Street in the city’s Kensington section. The officers had responded to a call about a disturbance or fight at that location. They were attempting to defuse the situation police said when additional family members of the feuding people came out of their houses and gathered on the sidewalk and in the middle of the street. Pushing and punching ensued between the original combatants police said when a man pulled a gun from his right rear waistband and fired it hitting both teenagers. The officers immediately pulled their service weapons and shot the “alleged” gunman and I have to wonder if we’ll see protests such as the ones following the shooting of Walter Wallace because the police killed a violent criminal. 484 + 2 = 486. Yes the dead criminal counts as a homicide even though it was obviously justified. And Christmas Day isn’t even over yet. Philly’s record is 505 killings in 1990 with 1989 coming in at second place with 489. With six more days remaining in 2020 the city has a very good chance to make second place. The left will cry for more gun control as though the guns somehow killed people by themselves. But the 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun used was reported stolen from Virginia. Shockingly it appears — though I hate to judge a thing like that before all of the facts are in¹ — that a criminal misguided gentleman broke the law in obtaining his weapon.

Updated: December 26 2020 | 8:45 AM EST Well how about that? It turns out that the Christmas Day shooter Jesus Perez killed his own son and wounded a nephew. From the updated version of the Inquirer story: The family of the man identified by CBS3 as Jesus Perez denied that he was armed or would have fired at his own child. “He would obviously never do that” his brother Noris Cueva-Nova said in an email. “He was a respectable hard-working man who cared deeply for his family.” The family denied that the guy from whose warm dead fingers the police pulled a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun was armed. I guess it was just imaginary bullets which struck and killed the guy’s son.
