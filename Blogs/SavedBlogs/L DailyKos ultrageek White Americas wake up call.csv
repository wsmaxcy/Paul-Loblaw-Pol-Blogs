L, White America's wake up call, ultrageek, 2021-04-19, I wrote this on FB.  It is no longer on my wall.  So I wanted to share it here…-=-=-=-=- Perhaps you have heard people say that racism hasnt increased: the number of witnesses has. Which is entirely true. But what has decreased is White America's ability to pretend that it was always a lie.  That is was a he said/she said thing.  That we would never -- could never -- know the truth.   No. Maybe that Black America was somehow mistaken.  Or exaggerating.  Or what they claimed was racism was bitter grapes.  Or maybe individual events were magnified through a lens of historical injustice.  Or maybe they were outright lies.   Maybe they were playing a reverse racism card to bait the white liberals to turn against white conservatives.   A clever ruse.  Opportunism.  All the more grotesque in light of the tragedy. We had to understand -- all of us --White Black HispanicWe had to understand That the police were there to serve and protect.  That they had dangerous jobs.  That the decisions that they had to make in a split second -- life or death decisions -- oughtnt to be second-guessed by those of us who werent there.  Monday morning quarterbacks.  In the safety of our comfy chairs in our warm and well-lit livingrooms. WatchingAfter the factWhat we would never be brave enoughto seefrom theireyesfacing down unimaginable terrors That surely they would never shoot an unarmed boy.   Our police were the best of us.  They were well trained.  Well regulated.  There was oversight so that this wouldnt happen.   Couldnt happen. The police would never -- could never -- commit cold. blooded. murder.  In broad daylight.   Right there in the street. No.Surely not. That in the very instant that a policeman murdered a man By kneeling on his neck For 2 minutesor 3or 4or 5 His partner would pull him off.Snap him out of it. Maybe it was a heat of the moment thing. A split second when the cop says "drop it" and the kid does AT THE VERY MOMENT the cop shot.  He was in fear for his life. Surely he wouldnt drive into a parkAnd shoot an unarmed boy It. Couldnt. Happen. Surely not.Never.No. The Black community was in mourning.  Another of itz children killed.   Perhaps we could feel sympathy.  For the mourning mother.  The elder sister.  The grandparents.  Crying over the potential of the young man just about to grad uate.  Who had just won a scholarship.  Who was a newly commissioned Lieutenant. But they werent there that night.They would never know what happened On that streetIn that parking lotIn that parkIn that holding cellStrapped to that immobilizing chairChained to that bed We would trust our policeThey deal with bad guysAnd who are we to judge them? Surely it wasnt murder. We're not dealing with white supremacists.Who lynched countless hundredsThousandsof innocentunarmed people That Laquan McDonald wasnt Emmett Till.  That George Floyd wasnt James Chaney. Those deaths -- though unfortunate -- were half-a-century ago. Those daysThose horrible days Those days were overThose menThe men who comitted those horrible atrocitiesWere not parading aroundUnder color of lawRighteous and braveKilling Black menin our streets It wasnt murder.  OUR young men wouldnt kill THEIR young men. Well yes.  Yes they would. And nowIn the cold light of day We cannot deny it any longerIt shocks the conscience As it shouldAs it always should have And we cannot allowthese ever-mountinginjusticesto stand We must stand alongside our Black brothers and sisters -- as we should have all along -- and say THERE IS NO PLACE IN A CIVIL SOCIETY FOR RACISM THAT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS -- REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN THE SLANT OF THEIR EYES THE SHAPE OF THEIR GENITALS WHOM THEY LOVE OR HOW THEY WORSHIP should never to fear walking down the street and shouldespeciallynever fearthe very people WHOM THEY PAYto protect them Ever. And thankfullyat last after the yearsdecadescenturies we are witnesses and we cannot claim ignorance
