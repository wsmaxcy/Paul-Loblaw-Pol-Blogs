L, KY: A year after impressive primary run Charles Booker launches campaign to unseat Sen. Rand Paul, Charles Jay, 2021-07-01, Charles Booker who impressed many but fell short in last year’s Democratic primary to choose a challenger to Mitch McConnell launched a new Senate bid on Thursday hoping to unseat incumbent Sen. Rand Paul who will be seeking his third term. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Booker was kicking off his campaign with a rally Thursday in the majority-Black Louisville district he represented in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

And it's one that says we're ready to come together across race class geography that we're ready to fight for structural change and we're ready to heal and we're ready to do more than just struggle." Booker was a big underdog in last year’s Democratic primary against former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath who had the backing of the national party establishment. He ran as an unabashed progressive and came within 3 percentage points of an upset victory. Despite raising $90 million and running as a centrist McGrath still ended up losing to McConnell by nearly 20 percentage points. Booker told the newspaper that he will campaign once again “from the hood to the holler” and take no area for granted. Most analysts rate the Senate race as solidly Republican and give Booker little chance of beating Paul. But Booker says he’ll run an unconventional campaign against Paul and reach voters who typically tune out Democratic candidates. "Rationing your insulin like I've had to do that's not partisan. Putting food on the table being safe in your home these issues aren't partisan" Booker told the newspaper. "And if we can tell that truth and show that we're actually fighting the same battles so we should fight together it's an opportunity to transcend party to really build this coalition based on those kind of bonds." Booker said he expects that the national Democratic Party will not intervene in the Democratic primary as it did to support McGrath.  He told the newspaper that he has recruited two Georgia women Dasheika Ruffin and Bianca Keaton who played key roles in Sen. Raphael Warnock’s successful campaign to join his leadership team. Paul immediately went on the attack against Booker by touting his endorsement by Donald Trump and saying that he doesn’t think “defunding the police and forcing taxpayers to pay for reparations will be very popular in Kentucky” Booker countered by saying Paul is a champion of stoking “the current climate of hate and fear” with the aim of keeping Kentuckians “divided fighting amongst ourselves so that they can laugh to the bank” and “continue to hold power at our expense.”
