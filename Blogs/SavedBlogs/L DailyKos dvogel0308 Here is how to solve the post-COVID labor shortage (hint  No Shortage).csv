L, Here is how to solve the post-COVID labor shortage (hint:  No Shortage), dvogel0308, 2021-06-28, I live in a GOP dominated county in NJ and I was in my local high-end deli getting lunch and I overheard a woman who was ranting online (because she was forced to wait 7 minutes for service) that nobody is taking jobs because of $300 per week with the obligatory that their “liberal woke” parents are giving the teenagers too much stuff so they have no incentive to work… Neither is true...nobody is staying home because of $300 per week unless they are a single parent with no daycare options and those are probably not going back to work anytime soon.  There is 1 reason why employers are having trouble finding workers...offering them a wage too little to work.  My teenage kids if they lived in a state where the minimum wage was still $7.65 per hour or lower for wait staff in restaurants they would not get off the couch for such pittance of wages.  Fortunately they live in progressive NJ that has a $12 minimum wage (going to $15).  My daughter just got her first job at a local Wawa for $13.50 per hour+$500 signing bonus and +$300 Covid vaccination bonus and she is thrilled to work. If you want to end the labor shortage try this experiment...raise your starting pay by $1 each week until you get the number of qualified applicants to fill all your open positions.   When they are all filled that is the equilibrium wage for your workplace...peace
