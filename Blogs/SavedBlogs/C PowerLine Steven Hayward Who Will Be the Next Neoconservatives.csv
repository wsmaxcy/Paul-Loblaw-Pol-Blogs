C, Who Will Be the Next Neoconservatives?, Steven Hayward, 2021-04-19, As the country going through a cycle of leftist madness last seen in the 1960s we can recall that a number of liberals woke up to the defects of their creed and became the founding generation of “neoconservatives” that is liberals who had been “mugged by reality.” That original generation were mostly academic social scientists of one stripe or another. Will we see a new generation of “neoconservatives” arising out of the present madness? And if so where will they come from? Probably not from academia but from journalism (think Glenn Greenwald Matt Yglesias and even Jonathan Chait to some extent) and—dare I say or hope for it—Hollywood? Exhibit One is lefty comedian Bill Maher who as we’ve noted before has delivered several ringing attacks on cancel culture and political correctness in general. Last Friday he went off on liberals the media and their treatment of COVID. And surprisingly for Maher this rant has fewer of his crude f-bombs so I can give this one a PG-13 rating. If he keeps this up he’ll be voting Republican sooner or later. Given how many comedians are seeing the humorlessness of the left I suspect many of them are going to come around if they haven’t already.  Commenters who employ what we deem extreme vulgarity in a comment — “s***” “f***” “a*******” or one of their many variants — will be banned without further notice.  “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”
