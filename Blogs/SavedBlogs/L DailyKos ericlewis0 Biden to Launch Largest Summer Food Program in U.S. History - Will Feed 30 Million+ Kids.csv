L, Biden to Launch Largest Summer Food Program in U.S. History - Will Feed 30 Million+ Kids, ericlewis0, 2021-04-26, From NBC News: The Biden administration on Monday will announce the launch of a summer food program to feed more than 30 million low-income children the Agriculture Department told NBC News. It is the latest push by the White House to address widespread hunger and food insecurity in the U.S. one the agency said it believes is the largest summer food program in the country's history. "Congress through the American Rescue Plan expanded this program to operate during the summer which I think was just highly responsive to what we need right now" said Stacy Dean the deputy under secretary of agriculture for food nutrition and consumer services. "We know that summer hunger is a problem in normal years but obviously this year with heightened food hardship as a result of the pandemic we're happy to deploy the program this summer." The plan will provide up to 34 million children about $375 each to buy food for the roughly 10 weeks they are out of school in the summer. That's when impoverished children have long struggled with hunger as free or reduced-price lunch school programs that guarantee meals don't operate then. That's around $7 a weekday. www.nbcnews.com/… Elections have consequences. This is why we vote. So happy to see President Biden championing great and essential causes like this.
