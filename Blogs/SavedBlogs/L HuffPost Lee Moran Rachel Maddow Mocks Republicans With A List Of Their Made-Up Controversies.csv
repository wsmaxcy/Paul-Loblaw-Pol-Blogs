L, Rachel Maddow Mocks Republicans With A List Of Their Made-Up Controversies, Lee Moran, 2021-04-28, Rachel Maddow on Tuesday examined how Republicans “have not found their feet yet to say the least in terms of criticizing let alone meaningfully opposing” President Joe Biden. Instead of holding Biden’s administration to account conservative media and elected GOP officials have turned to pushing “weird made-up cockamamie stuff” the MSNBC anchor said. Republicans in recent weeks have gotten riled up over changes to Mr. Potato Head branding a Muppets disclaimer Dr. Seuss’ so-called “cancellation” and bogus reports about Biden banning red meat and Vice President Kamala Harris handing out a book to migrant children. “It’s weird but it’s significant that Republicans over and over and over again over the last 98 days have just incessantly gone for these made-up sidebar crises and controversies one after another that aren’t real things and certainly aren’t things the Biden admin is doing” Maddow said. “I mean there are other things to talk about if you are in opposition right?” she continued. “If you are the Biden White House that’s probably a good sign that the opposition party really doesn’t know what to say about you and does not know what to say about the substance of what you are doing.” Watch the video above.
