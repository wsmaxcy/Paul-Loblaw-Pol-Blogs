L, Doodle II Coming Along., A Pagan in Arizona, 2021-04-27, Spring has sprung baby birds are chirping the chaparral is blooming my herbs and trees and trumpet vines are growing lushly green. Today's been blessedly cool and damp the sort of day I'll remember wistfully when late July rolls around and it's 110° outside. What chores there were were done fairly quickly. I didn't have to go anywhere at all. Such days are rare enough for me to recognize and make the most of when they appear.  It was a perfect day for alternately sitting outside watching and listening... and sitting indoors painting. As close to a perfect day as I can imagine.
