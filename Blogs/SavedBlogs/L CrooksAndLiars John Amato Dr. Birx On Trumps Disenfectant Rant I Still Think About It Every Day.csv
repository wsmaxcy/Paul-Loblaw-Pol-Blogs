L, Dr. Birx On Trump's Disenfectant Rant: 'I Still Think About It Every Day', John Amato, 2021-03-16, Dr. Deborah Birx told ABC's Terry Moran that she didn't know how to handle Trump after he claimed disinfectants and UV lights might help combat COVID. Moran asked how much responsibility she should take for the former White House's insane messaging on dealing with the pandemic. Moran highlighted the insane things Trump said. "When you  heard [Trump] saying things that weren't true contradicting science as you think about your role in that? -- How that impacted the American people?" "There's a lot of tape on that you can see how extraordinarily uncomfortable I was" Dr. Birx said. Birx claimed her training in the military cautioned her from correcting the commander-in-chief especially since Trump was talking to DHS scientists  who had presented the data during that presser.  "Frankly I didn‚Äôt know how to handle that episode. I still think about it every day.‚Äù Dr. Birx said.  So do the rest of us.  Maryland's Gov. Hogan said "We Had Hundreds Of Calls Come Into Our Emergency Hotline' Following Trump's Disinfectant Remarks."   She continued "When I was spoken to I said not a treatment." Dr. Birx was more malleable during her press events with Trump than Dr. Fauci but you could see her squirming when Trump was discussing UV lights and disinfectants. But the mainstream media is demanding Joe Biden congratulate Trump for throwing money at the private sector to help develop a vaccine. ‚ÄúUh huh... uh huh... what... jc what... uh huh... disinfectant... that‚Äôs fuking toxic... this moron talking... uh huh... uh huh... light? jc light... what did I do to deserve this... this lunatic is going to kill us... what the fuk an I going to say tomorrow... I feel a draft.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/lKZRqjUChT ‚Äî Jay Arnold üé¨ (@jadedcreative) April 24 2020 For 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.
