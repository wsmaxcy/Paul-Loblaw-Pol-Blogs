L, Pat Robertson Can't Believe A Police Officer Could Confuse Stun Gun For Firearm, David Moye, 2021-04-15, The killing of 20-year-old Daunte Wright by former Brooklyn Center Minnesota police officer Kim Potter this past weekend has many asking how a law enforcement official with 26 years of experience could confuse a firearm with a stun gun. One of those is noted conservative TV evangelist Pat Robertson who had a hard time understanding how the mistake could happen in the first place. On Thursday’s show he spent a few minutes comparing the two weapons only to declare “There’s just no comparison.” They are two entirely different colors Robertson pointed out adding that Potter “shot that poor guy to death ... and if you can’t tell the difference between those two things it’s crazy.” He also had harsh words for the police for allowing the number of high-profile shootings of citizens to continue. “I am pro-police folks!” he said. “I think we need the police we need their service and they do a good job. But if they don’t stop this onslaught ... they cannot do this!” Who had “Woke Pat Robertson” on their 2021 bingo card? pic.twitter.com/nCYlQsma3O “I think the problem is they’ve got to pay them more” Robertson continued. “We don’t have the finest in the police department. They’re low-paid people.”  Robertson emphasized the need for police but said “we cannot have a bunch of clowns running around who are underpaid and who really are not the best and brightest. We’ve got to have the best in there.” Many Twitter users appreciated the televangelist’s thoughts but couldn’t quite believe they were coming out of his mouth. Hell has officially frozen over https://t.co/EW8ms8XETs Well after "Woke AXL" I cant say I saw 91 year old "WOKE Pat Robertson on the horizon I mean that was just a crazy dream!. It's true: when youve lost Pat Robertson you should probably find a towel and throw it and then build a human firewall around Ted Nugent https://t.co/sfmllaORap I sure didn’t see this coming. It got to be pretty damn bad if Pat Robertson is saying the police in all of these situations suck. But whoever this daisy is with Pat- this is not a training issue. This is a culture of systemic and intentional use of force. Against black people. https://t.co/iRd7AIjcWp Dogs and cats living together...
