L, Top Comments: So Many Pictures Edition, brilligforTop Comments, 2021-07-05, I hope everyone had a most excellent July Fourth yesterday! We here at Top Comments took the evening off either to enjoy the evening or to comfort those human and fur-friends scared of the fireworks. I hope you had a chance to listen to NPR personalities reading the Declaration of Independence and also descendents of Frederick Douglass read his "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" speech. If not go take eighteen minutes and listen to both. I’ll still be here.  Gizmo mentioned in a recent diary he was getting his house ready to be listed for sale and I hope that’s going well! I keep thinking we should do the same because it will force us to go through all of our stuff with much more vigor than we’ve got right now :). One thing I AM working hard on however is somehow getting a handle on the many many photos we have. We have boxes (and boxes...) of photos and other old historical memorabilia (birth certificates mortgage papers etc)  inherited from my parents. We have actual print photos from the early decades of Mr. Brillig’s and my lives together because yes we predate camera phones and the cloud. Wedding and honeymoon photos. Trips we’ve taken and enough photos of K1 in her early years we probably could wallpaper a room with them. Mr. Brillig has boxes of slides from trips he took as a child with his grandparents.  And then there’s the photos that exist only in digital form: tens of thousands of photos from a decade of iPhone shots.  I have some wonderful pictures of my parents their parents and other relatives. My Mom thankfully labeled some of them so I recognize by name people I never met in person but others are absolute mysteries… and the people who might have known who is who are no longer with us. Do I get rid of or keep them?  To be completely honest I’m overwhelmed. Of course some of the decisions are easy. Blurry photos of landscape or animals taken on childhood vacations now lost to the mists of time? Gone. Twenty-five blurry photos from my Confirmation? Definitely gone! All those photos of my sibling that don’t have anything to do with me? I sent them along and now they’re Not My Monkeys!  We do have a scanner and I’m going through the old photos box by box and after a cursory sort to get rid of the aforementioned Easy Ones I scan and then put those into a ‘Done’ box. The scans will be backed up to our server just like most of the photos Mr. Brillig and I took are back when photos were developed and returned with a disc of images (remember those?!). But we run into the problem of how do you decide which physical photos to keep and once you do that how to organize them?  Also the separate issue of how to organize the thousands of images on our server or in the cloud? They’re good to no one if we can’t find what we’re looking for!  Tell me my dear Top Comments Readers: how do YOU manage the myriad images in your life? All electronic? A couple of curated albums? Boxes organized by date or topic? Or does everyone else have these boxes stored somewhere? Share your strategies so we ALL can benefit!!

Brillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. "TopCommentness" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world we'd all build community supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down.
