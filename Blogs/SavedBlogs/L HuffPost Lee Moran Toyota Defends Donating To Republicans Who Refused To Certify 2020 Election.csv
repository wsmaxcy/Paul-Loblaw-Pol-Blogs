L, Toyota Defends Donating To Republicans Who Refused To Certify 2020 Election, Lee Moran, 2021-06-29, Automaker Toyota has drawn fierce backlash for campaign donations to Republican members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020 election result. “We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification” a spokesperson for the company told Axios﻿ which exposed $55000 in donations to 37 elected GOP members of Congress citing data compiled by the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Toyota is the no. 1 donor to Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 election results — by farhttps://t.co/6zPD5LNpnR pic.twitter.com/coBWOnORoa “Based on our thorough review we decided against giving to some members who through their statements and actions undermine the legitimacy of our elections and institutions” the spokesperson added. Toyota didn’t say which lawmakers it decided not to donate to via its corporate PAC. Some 147 Republicans in Congress objected to the formal certification of President Joe Biden’s victory even after the assault on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of ex-President Donald Trump’s supporters. The excuse caused Toyota to trend on Twitter for the wrong reasons with many outraged customers calling for a boycott of the company. I briefly considered the Toyota Sedition but settled on the Kia Sorento. More USB ports and 100 percent less insurrection. https://t.co/0GnZGY2B33 Hello @Toyota?  I’ve had my @Lexus since 2012.  Second one. Loved them both. Was looking at your new models for 2022.  Now though there  will not be a third one until you clean up your act.  @slpng_giants https://t.co/3eq2YVGko0 Toyota makes great cars.  But they are a threat to American democracy. https://t.co/r6DoUiOSK8 The error made by Toyota & others when they continue to support pols backing sedition is that they think it's politics as usual. Many thoughtful well-informed Americans consider those pols to pose an existential threat to democracy & now see Toyota as supporting that threat. I own a plug-in Prius hybrid that I've frequently praised on the air to our audience of 7 million; it's the last car I'm buying from @Toyota. Any company that supports people trying to overthrow our republic is a company that has lost my support. https://t.co/mSeioEc4Ri Auto companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars convincing consumers that driving their car "says something about you"Driving a Prius used to mean you cared about the environment. Now it's a symbol of the Big Lie. Toyota just flushed decades of branding down the toilet Dumping my Prius Prime ASAP…#Toyota https://t.co/UtDaygex8j BREAKING: Toyota debuting its new 2021 model The Insurrection. No matter what happens today every PR person is thinking: Well at least I don’t work for Toyota! Hey @Toyota! My family owns two Priuses (or Prii). One is ten years old and ready for a replacement. We won’t purchase another Toyota again. Have a nice day. https://t.co/MjFid6yd3g Looking forward to the release of the new Toyota Sedition with the MAGA package .@Toyota is bankrolling the Big Lie. What a coincidence @Toyota I do not believe it is appropriate to buy cars from companies that fund politicians who try to overthrow our Democracy.Wifey & I are deciding between Toyota Honda & Nissan for our next minivan. Let's go places...not named Toyota. https://t.co/CTpbzpANyd Happy Monday to Toyota's communications department. I do believe it's appropriate to judge a car company solely on whether it undermines democracy. https://t.co/KiZGOjyONI Our household will never buy a Toyota after this. Anyone else?#BoycottToyota https://t.co/ThgJlvLXa2 Yep my 2007 Prius has served me well and I was planning on buying another Toyota but that's it the window especially after their response. #BoycottToyota https://t.co/qV62IfYSO0 Hey @Toyota you are now the #1 sponsor of GQP Seditionists who all voted against certifying the election. We see what drives you. Shame on you @Toyota. My next car will not be yours. Good morning @Toyota As a United States Army veteran who took an oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and DOMESTIC I really want to know why you continue to fund the Republican Party who assaulted our Democracy and freedoms. When corporations like @Toyota say "We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification" what they're really saying is "We care about our profits more than we care about democracy." If @Toyota decides that truth rule of law and the tenets of democracy aren’t worth preserving then maybe I decide that my Prius lease isn’t worth preserving either. This car model from Toyota has taken on a new meaning. pic.twitter.com/dNLMI9GhnC
