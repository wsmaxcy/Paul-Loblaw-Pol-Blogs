L, Fox News Hosts Praise Firing Squads: Now You Can ‘Shoot ’Em Stick ’Em Or Fry ’Em’, Lee Moran, 2021-05-06, Fox News personalities Pete Hegseth and Will Cain got all excited Wednesday about the South Carolina House of Representatives approving a bill that would add the firing squad as a method for executing people on death row. On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Primetime” Cain suggested that the method was “more honest” than the use of lethal injection drugs and host Hegseth agreed. Hegseth kicked off the discussion with a callous comment about how there are now three ways to die in the state if you are on death row. “Shoot ’em stick ’em or fry ’em” he said referring in part to the electric chair which is also used as a method of execution in South Carolina. Cain said Hegseth’s summary was “terrible” before going on to share his thoughts on the bill. “Not only do I not have a problem with” firing squads” the “Fox & Friends Weekend” co-host said but “it might be a more preferable means of execution.” “Firing squads are at least more honest about what you’re doing” he continued. “I think sometimes when we do lethal injection or whatever we’re trying to ease us as a society.” “Go to sleep” Hegseth interjected. “We’re trying to ease our own pain that we are doing this to someone that we decided deserves it. Firing squads are just honest” Cain added. “They are” Hegseth agreed.
