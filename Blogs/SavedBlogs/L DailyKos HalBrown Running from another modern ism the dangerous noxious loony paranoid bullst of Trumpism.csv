L, Running from another modern "ism" the dangerous noxious loony paranoid bulls*t of Trumpism, HalBrown, 2021-06-29, There are only a few national leaders from the last 100 years who have an “ism” added to their name: Mao Lenin and Marx come to mind as commonly use “isms”. Hitler has Hitlerism too but that term isn’t often used. Look up  Trumpism on Wikipedia you will find a long illustrated entry. It has hundreds of references. "Trumpists" and "Trumpian" are terms referring to those exhibiting characteristics of Trumpism whereas political supporters of Donald Trump are known as "Trumpers". Excerpt: Trumpism started its development predominantly during the 2016 presidential campaign. For many scholars it denotes a populist political method that suggests nationalistic answers to political economic and social problems. These inclinations are refracted into such policy preferences as immigration restrictionism trade protectionism isolationism and opposition to entitlement reform.[52] As a political method populism is not driven by any particular ideology.[53] Former National Security Advisor and former close Trump advisor John Bolton states this is true of Trump disputing that "Trumpism" even exists in any meaningful philosophical sense emphasizing that "[t]he man does not have a philosophy. And people can try and draw lines between the dots of his decisions. They will fail." . When I read Trump's “Ohio rage rally speech was a flop with some of his fans -- and MSNBC has the video to prove it” (Rawstory) this part jumped out at me: After sharing a long clip of Trump fans leaving the Ohio fairgrounds with Trump's voice droning on the background Williams added "You can still hear his voice in the background there as the president relitigated his loss in Arizona. As you saw people's thoughts turned to 'where did we park?'" The images that popped into my not yet fully caffeinated brain at 6:00 AM was of a crowd running and being trampled by the bulls in Pamplona. I am not as naive to hope that the people who left the Trump rally early were really running away from everything Trump stands for i.e. from what historians have describes as Trumpism.  . Having lived in Michigan farm country for 20 years I would never denigrate bull sh*t. After all “cow manure is not only an agricultural waste but also an organic fertilizer resource. The application of organic fertilizer is a feasible practice to mitigate the soil degradation caused by overuse of chemical fertilizers which can affect the bacterial diversity and community composition in soils.” (reference)  I could offer numerous examples of why the words dangerous noxious loony and paranoid apply to the description of the bulls*t that is evacuated from the Trumpians a group whose brains rather than being connected to their spinal columns goes directly into their rectums.  The bullsh*t starts at the top with the twice impeached former president himself who noxiously and dangerously makes statements that may very well foster more violence from his “right-wing militia” down to Tucker Carlson who has now bought into the loony and paranoid conspiracy “theory” that the NSA is monitoring him in an attempt to take his show off the air. No s*t Sherlock we are all trying to run from the bullsh*t of Trumpism.  Addendum: The term bullsh*t as applied to Trump’s lies has been given new relevance ever since William Barr used it in his interview with Jonathan Karl. This is from “America owes thanks to Trump’s lawyers — even William Barr” in The Washington Post by George Conway III. An excerpt from a forthcoming book by ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl describes what Barr thought about the 45th president’s claims of electoral fraud: “It was all bulls---t." The Justice Department “realized from the beginning it was just bulls---." No legal term English or Latin fits better than that.  Barr shared a similar assessment with Trump at the White House on Dec. 1 2020 Karl reports. You’ve shown no fraud Barr explained and yet “your people keep on shoveling this s--- out.” Barr’s opposition left Trump enraged. One attendee described the president as having “the eyes and mannerism of a madman.” The book reports that the “livid” president responded by saying “You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump.”
