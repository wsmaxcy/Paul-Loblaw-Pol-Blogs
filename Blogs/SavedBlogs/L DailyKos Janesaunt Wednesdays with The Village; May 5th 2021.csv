L, Wednesdays with The Village; May 5th 2021, Janesaunt, 2021-05-05,   The schedule for the upcoming Wednesdays is as follows: May 12 — Janesaunt May 19 — DeeQuilter May 26 — USExpat June 2 — Joker June 9 — Janesaunt  houyhnhnm will continue hosting us on Saturday mornings WYgal continues to host a Saturday evening music diary    USExpat and her family flew here from Peru early Friday morning and arrived just after midnight that night. Like so many other countries Peru is far behind the US in getting people vaccinated.  Their pediatrician who hasn’t even been vaccinated yet encouraged them to come here to get vaccinated.  There were some logistical challenges to making the trip happen in time to give her husband time to get two shots before having to return for an important work project in June.  She and the kids will likely stay for most of the summer so she’s got her hands full with a lengthy to-do and to-pack list for everyone.   Appointment availability here is pretty much wide open right now so the timing will work well for them.  She and her husband got their first Pfizer shot on Saturday.  The three week wait for the 2nd shot allows her husband to get his 2nd shot and recover from any side effects before flying back to Peru. I can’t tell you how relieved I am for them to be safely here and to get vaccinated!  ****** Last week we were off on a camping trip to Joshua Tree National Park in southern California.  We went with two other couples and all of us were 2 weeks beyond our 2nd shot.  We also have our own campsites but will of course be spending time together to hike eat drink and enjoy the beauty of the park.  The park is east of Palm Springs area north of the Salton Sea and south of the Mojave Desert.      I can’t compete with Joker’s layout skills — so imagine this part of the diary is below the pictures.
