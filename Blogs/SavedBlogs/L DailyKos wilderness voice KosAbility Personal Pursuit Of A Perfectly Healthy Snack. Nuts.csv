L, KosAbility: Personal Pursuit Of A Perfectly Healthy Snack. Nuts?, wilderness voice, 2021-04-25, What is beneficial for cardiovascular health? The charts above are from a study published in 2017 in the Lancet entitled: Associations of fats and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality in 18 countries from five continents (PURE): a prospective cohort study. The study followed over 100000 individuals for seven years. I originally covered this here. Referring to the these charts we can see that the major offender for both cardiovascular and total mortality risk is excess carbohydrate consumption. So for healthy snacks carbs are out. By comparison saturated fats are a minor offender - when they constitute more than 7% of calories additional consumption results in a slight increase in cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless we are in pursuit of perfection here so we want to minimize the saturated fats in favor of the mono- and poly-unsaturated fats. To that end the following charts are useful: Here is a similar chart that contains additional items: Based on the above charts we can exclude the tropical oils and terrestrial animal fats from consideration. For the fans of coconut oil here is a systematic review that looks at the details. There are two varieties available unprocessed virgin oil and processed oil with the coconut flavor removed. What they had to say: Of these 9 studies reporting that coconut oil raised HDL-C levels [thought to be beneficial] 4 used extra-virgin or virgin coconut oil. In addition 4 studies reported a simultaneous rise in HDL-C and LDL-C [thought to be adverse] of which only one study used extra-virgin or virgin coconut oil. In 3 other studies coconut oil resulted in a significantly higher level of TC [total cholesterol]  and LDL-C with no significant effects on HDL-C. All 3 of these studies did not use virgin coconut oil. So if you are going to use coconut oil this review says stick to the unprocessed virgin oil. A related product MCT Oil which consists of six and eight carbon fatty acids arranged as a a triglyceride was found to be helpful to cardiovascular health in this small study. Moving on a note about the glycemic index:  The Glycemic Index (GI) is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods There will never be a glycemic index for fat because fat is metabolized by converting it into ketones rather than sugars. So fat consumption will not raise blood sugar levels. Leafy green vegetables – I checked specifically on spinach and arugula. No surprise to find they have insignificant carbs and fats. So they certainly qualify under the no carb and low sat fat standard. For today I will be focusing on nuts. A discussion of vegetables and legumes will wait for another day. There are numerous systematic reviews of the effect of nut consumption on cardiovascular health. They all reported some favorable effect. For example this review found improvement of flow mediated dilation a measure of vascular flexibility: consumption of nuts resulting in significant improvements in FMD [flow mediated dilation]...Nut consumption resulted in small non-significant differences in CRP [C-reactive protein ]... Small non-significant differences were also found for other biomarkers of inflammation. Another review: Nut consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis reported In the multivariable-adjusted model pooled RRs [relative risks] for each serving per day of nut consumption were 0.72 for IHD [ischemic heart disease] 0.71 for CVD [cardiovascular disease] and 0.83 for all-cause mortality. Pooled RRs for the comparison of extreme quantiles of nut intake were 1.00 for type 2 diabetes 0.66 for IHD 0.70 for CVD 0.91 for stroke and 0.85 for all-cause mortality.[Confidence intervals omitted for readability] All of the reviews I found used studies of more the one kind of nut - mixed nuts so to speak . Since I am interested specific guidance I took a look at studies of individual nuts: A pistachio nut diet pistachios (contributing 20% of total energy) was found to improve the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. A study of the effect of pistachios on metabolic syndrome found: Statistically significant improvement in mean values for various parameters in the intervention group compared with control group were as follows: WC [waist circumference dropped by 1.5 cm]  (P < 0.02) FBG [fasting blood glucose dropped by 4% ] (P < 0.04) total cholesterol (P < 0.02) [dropped 11%] low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.006) hs-CRP (P < 0.05) [C-reactive protein a measure of cardiovascular inflammation dropped 20%] TNF-α (P < 0.03) [another measure of inflammation] FFAs [free fatty acids] (P < 0.001). Here is a supplier of organic pistachios. A walnut enhanced diet consisting of two ounces of walnuts per day resulted in significantly improved flow mediated dilation. A pecan enriched diet significantly reduced insulin and a measurement of insulin resistance each by about 10% in overweight adults. I have found that lightly toasted pecans - a 250 degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes - are delicious. A review of studies of macadamia nuts found: Six peer‐reviewed scientific articles ... all six articles reported improvements in risk factors for cardiovascular disease particularly decreased total blood cholesterol and LDL‐cholesterol. A systematic review of cashew nuts found a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure by 4 points and a reduction of triglycerides and nonsignificant reductions in other lipid parameters. A study of almond supplementation (1.5 oz/d) without further diet instruction found: inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein was significantly reduced in the almond-treated group versus controls (−1.2 vs. +4.33 mg/L p = 0.029) Sunflower seeds are unique in that they are not a tree nut but they are closer to being a nut than a grain. A study comparing adding about an ounce of sunflower seed daily to diet as compared to an ounce of almonds found that sunflower seeds reduced both HDL and triglycerides as compared to almonds and that both reduced total cholesterol and LDL significantly. A systematic review of studies of peanuts found no significant effects except for an increase in HDL Potential adverse effect: oxalates can cause kidney stones in susceptible individuals. There are many foods that are high in oxalates including some nuts: Source: Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health So oxalate sensitive persons need to be aware of the possibility of almonds or cashews exceeding their oxalate tolerance. Likewise consumption of particular nuts is not suitable for people with allergies to those nuts. One size does not fit all.
