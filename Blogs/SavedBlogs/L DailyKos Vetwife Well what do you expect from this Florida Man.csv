L, Well what do you expect from this Florida Man?, Vetwife, 2021-04-26,  Allow me to introduce you to the Governor of Florida... pic.twitter.com/aimVnJhTPD This was from last year and after a full year he has  not learned very much about masks. www.abcactionnews.com/… If DeSantis fails to extend the emergency order for another 60 days Pasco County Schools Superintendent Kurt Browning said he will have no choice but to make mask-wearing optional district-wide. Browning says it's his wish to keep the mask requirement in place for the remainder of the school year but he told the school board earlier this month that his authority to enforce it depends on whether the governor's office extends it beyond today. You Tube also pulled a video of a Roundtable of DeSantis and Medical opinions.  Sigh….  This man is just not smart. YouTube has deleted a video in which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and a handful of medical experts questioned the effectiveness of having children wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. The video which was removed on Wednesday was of a recent roundtable discussion DeSantis moderated on the global response to the pandemic. DeSantis was joined by Oxford epidemiologist Dr. Sunetra Gupta Harvard professor Dr. Martin Kulldorff and Dr. Scott Atlas and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya from Stanford University. The clip was posted by the American Institute for Economic Research and a transcript of the discussion can be found on the group’s website by clicking here. www.thewrap.com/… I really wonder even though the thought is repulsive does he know how to put on a condom any better?  Probably not. If this is Harvard and Yale graduate results well I am certainly glad I never attended any Ivy league schools. This is  Ignorance produced with degrees.  I hope the dem opponent keeps this mask debacle as a campaign ad.  It kinds reminds me of a Jim Carrey imitation of Dumb and Dumber.  I bet he is a loafer shoe man because learning to tie his shoes may not have been achieved yet.
