L, Democratic Marksman Takes Aim At Opponent Mark McCloskey, Chris capper Li..., 2021-06-11, We need your help now more than ever. Please subscribe or donate to us on a recurring or one-time basis.  Lucas Kunce is a Democratic candidate in Missouri running for the US Senate.  In a new video the goes after Republican candidate Mark McCloskey.  McCloskey of course is the fake tough guy that felt so scared by Black people walking peacefully past his mansion in his gated community that he ran outside waving an assault rifle around in a threatening fashion.  McCloskey is now facing a trial for reckless use of a weapon  Lucas Kunce a Democratic candidate for the same seat went after "Mansion Man Mark" in a new video mocking him without mercy.  The video starts with Kunce carrying his own AR-15. He takes aim and suddenly lowers his weapon saying that he had enough of carrying one around in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kunce goes on: Then Kunce laid down a challenge. Kunce said that if McCloskey finally does the right thing and apologizes to the people he had threatened Kunce said that he would give McCloskey a US Marine led class on weapons safety.  Kunce even went as far as to set up a website  dubbed Mansion Man Mark in which he repeats his offer and invites people to join and/or donate to his campaign. Unfortunately Missouri is a solid red state so Kunce will need all the help he can get in this uphill battle even though the Republicans can't seem to muster a halfway decent candidate. Remember that clown who got his 15 minutes of fame threatening people with a weapon of war outside his mansion? You know Mansion Man @Mark__McCloskey?Well I’m running against him for Missouri's open U.S. Senate seat. And I want to teach him a lesson. pic.twitter.com/3UGaoXvD4p — Lucas Kunce (@LucasKunceMO) June 9 2021 For 17 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit but now Facebook and social media are drowning us in an ocean of right wing lies.
